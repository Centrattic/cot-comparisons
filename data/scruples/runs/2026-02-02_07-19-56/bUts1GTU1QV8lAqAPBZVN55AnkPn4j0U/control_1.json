I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party. The author's dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house, but the author was planning to have friends over to play Smash Ultimate. The author is upset because they found out about the sleepover only a day before, and they didn't get to invite their friends to stay over. They don't like surprises and feel like they should have been told earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had to cancel their own birthday plan because their dad arranged a sleepover with a friend's kid. The author was not consulted in advance, and they feel it's unfair that they weren't given the same consideration if they wanted their friends to stay over. The mom also said no when the author asked if their friends could stay.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author is being considerate of their own feelings and plans. They had a specific event planned for their birthday and were excluded from the decision-making process. The parents made a decision that affects the author's plans without consulting them. That could be seen as the parents being inconsiderate. The author's desire for transparency and being included in decisions that affect their personal events is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have thought it's a good idea to let the son from the dad's friend stay over, maybe as a favor or to foster relationships. However, the way it was handled\u2014without prior notice and without considering the author's plans\u2014could be problematic. The author's frustration is about the lack of communication and the sudden change in plans. The fact that the author's own friends couldn't stay over even when they asked adds to the sense of unfairness.\n\nThe parent's actions seem to prioritize someone else's child's request (the friend's son) over the author's own celebration. That might not be fair. The author's reaction is about feeling that their autonomy and preferences are being disregarded. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way. Since the parents made the decision without consulting the author and it disrupted their plans, the author's upset is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
