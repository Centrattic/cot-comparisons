I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday when they had planned a party.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because they were not informed about the sleepover until the day before. They had a previous bad experience where their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, so they don't like surprises. The dad's friend's son decided to stay over, and the parents agreed yesterday, only telling the author today. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but is frustrated about the lack of notice and not being consulted.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break down the key points. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and the timing of the announcement. They wanted to plan their birthday party with friends, and this unexpected guest might interfere. The parents might have thought it's okay since it's a family friend's kid, but the author feels it's a surprise they didn't consent to.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have a valid reason to be upset. They value being informed in advance and not being surprised, especially after a past negative experience. The fact that they even asked if their friends could stay over and were denied shows they wanted consistency. The parents didn't consider the author's feelings or the prior plans when making the decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might argue that they were trying to be hospitable to a friend's kid. But the key issue here is the timing and lack of communication. The author's request for advance notice isn't unreasonable. They're not the only one whose birthday is at stake here. The parents should have discussed this with the author earlier, especially since it's a significant event.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They have a right to expect that their plans and preferences are considered, especially when it's their birthday. The parents made a mistake by not involving the author in the decision-making process. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
