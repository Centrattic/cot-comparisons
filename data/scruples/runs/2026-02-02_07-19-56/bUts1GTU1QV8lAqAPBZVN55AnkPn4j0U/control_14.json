I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author wanted to have friends over to play Smash Ultimate. Their dad's friend's son is coming for a sleepover without the author's knowledge, even though they were told just a day before. The author is upset because they didn't know about it and wanted to make sure their friends could stay too, but their mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author wanted to have a birthday party, planned the event, and was informed last minute about a guest they didn't agree to. They don't like surprises and feel they should have been consulted earlier. The dad made the decision without involving the author, which is a problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're upset because their autonomy in planning their own party is being overruled. They didn't ask for the kid to stay, and the fact that their mom said no to their friends staying might add to the frustration. The dad's friend's son just decided on the spot, which isn't fair if the author wasn't given a choice. The key here is consent and communication. The parents should have discussed the sleepover earlier and considered the author's preferences, especially since it's their birthday and their event. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to be involved in the decision-making process. So, the parents might be in the wrong here, not the author. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
