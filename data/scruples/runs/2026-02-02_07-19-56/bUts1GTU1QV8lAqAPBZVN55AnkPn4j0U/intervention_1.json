I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the father invited a friend's son for a sleepover without consulting the kid, who wanted to have their own party.\n\nFirst, the kid is upset because they don't like surprises and weren't given a say. The parents made the decision the day before, so the kid found out last minute. The kid is okay with the sleepover itself but objects to the lack of prior communication and the inconsistency in allowing their own friends to stay.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the parents are probably trying to do something they think is good, maybe to honor the friend's child or to include them. But the kid's perspective is important too. They were planning their birthday and wanted to have their own friends over. Being excluded from the decision-making might make them feel their preferences aren't respected. Also, the mom said no to their friends staying, which adds to the frustration because there's a double standard.\n\nThe key points here are the lack of communication and the kid's lack of input. Even if the parents meant well, not involving the child in such a personal event can be seen as dismissive. The kid's feelings about their birthday being a big deal, especially after the previous camp trip incident, suggest they have valid reasons for wanting control over their own celebration. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents might have failed to consider their child's feelings and autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
