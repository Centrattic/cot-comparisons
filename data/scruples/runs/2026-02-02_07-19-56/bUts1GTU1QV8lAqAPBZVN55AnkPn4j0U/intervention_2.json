I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author is upset that their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house without prior notice.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author wanted to have a Smash Ultimate party for some friends. Their mom mentioned that their dad invited a friend's kid, who's around 10. Then the kid decided to stay overnight, and the parents agreed just yesterday, telling the author today. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and weren't given a choice. They also asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no. The author is questioning if they're the a**hole here.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So I need to weigh the pros and cons. Let me break it down. \n\nThe parents made a decision without considering the author's wishes. The author had planned the party, and then a surprise guest is added. The author is not against the kid staying per se, but the lack of communication and the last-minute decision. The parents might have thought it's okay to invite a younger child, but the author's friends aren't allowed to stay, which seems inconsistent. Also, the author is a teenager (since their birthday is coming up and they're inviting friends), so autonomy is important here. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have a right to have guests over, but they should have considered the author's feelings and plans. The author's frustration seems valid because they were not consulted. The surprise aspect and not having a choice are key points. The parents didn't check with the author about the sleepover, even though the author had their own plans. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is upset about not being consulted and the sudden change. They are not against the guest but the way the decision was made. The parents should have respected the author's wishes and informed them earlier. The author's request for their friends to stay was denied, which might be a point of inconsistency. So I think the parents are at fault here for not communicating, and the author is justified in being upset. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
