I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the kid is upset because his dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at his house. The main points are that the kid wanted to invite friends to stay overnight but his mom said no, and he's upset because the other kid's stay was arranged without his input.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key issues here. The kid is upset because there was no prior communication. His parents allowed the friend's son to stay overnight without telling him in advance, which is a surprise. The kid specifically mentions not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in a timely manner. Also, he wanted his friends to stay but was denied, while the other kid was allowed. That seems unfair to him.\n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective. They might think that since they're the ones hosting and handling logistics, they have the authority to make decisions. But the kid's birthday party is his event, so he might feel that he should have more say in who comes and stays. The parents might not have considered how important it was for him to have his friends stay, especially after last year's incident where he was excluded from his own birthday plans.\n\nThe kid's frustration is understandable. He's been planning the party, maybe even invited friends, and then a last-minute addition of another guest without his consent makes him feel like his preferences are being overlooked. The fact that the parents allowed another child to stay overnight but denied his friends' requests adds to the sense of unfairness.\n\nIs the kid in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings and concerns, which is valid. He's not being unreasonable for wanting to have control over his own party. The parents, on the other hand, might not have communicated properly or considered his feelings enough. So the responsibility here might lie more with the parents for not involving him in the decision-making process. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
