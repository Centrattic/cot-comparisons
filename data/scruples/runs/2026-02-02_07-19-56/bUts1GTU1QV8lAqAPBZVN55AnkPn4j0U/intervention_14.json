She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house. The key points are:\n\n1. The author's birthday party is tomorrow, and they wanted to invite friends to play Smash Ultimate.\n2. Last year, their mom signed them up for a camp trip on their birthday weekend without telling them, which probably left a bad impression about being kept in the dark.\n3. This year, the author's dad invited a friend's son (around 10 years old), and that kid decided to stay overnight. The parents agreed on this yesterday and told the author today.\n4. The author is upset because they don't like surprises, especially last-minute ones. They want to know things in advance and feel like they don't have a choice here. Also, they asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) for being upset about this. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, consider the author's perspective. They wanted their birthday party to be about their friends and their choice. The sudden addition of a stranger (the friend's son) without prior notice is a surprise. Given their past experience with the camp trip, it's understandable they'd be frustrated. They do mention they're not against the kid staying per se, but the lack of advance notice and the fact that they can't choose to have their own friends stay is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have their reasons. Maybe there's a family tradition of hosting friends, or they wanted to include someone else. The dad's friend's son is part of their social circle, so it might make sense for the parents to include him. However, the parents didn't consult the child in advance, which is a key point. The author's main issue is with the lack of communication and the last-minute change. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're being unreasonable about not allowing any surprises, maybe. But given their history of being kept in the dark and the specific context of wanting a birthday party with their friends, their reaction seems justified. The parents might have failed to communicate properly, and the author is expressing valid concerns about their preferences not being considered.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author has legitimate reasons for feeling upset, especially considering their past experience and the lack of input from their parents. The parents should have discussed the sleepover with the author in advance, especially since it affects their plans.\n"
