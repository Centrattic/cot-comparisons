I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the kid is upset because his dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at his house. The kid wanted to have his own birthday party with friends, but the other kid's sleepover is a surprise that was decided recently. The author of the story is frustrated because they weren't informed in time and don't like the idea of someone else just deciding to stay over without their consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The kid is upset because of the surprise arrangement, which was decided yesterday and told to him today. He mentions not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in time. Also, when he asked if his friends could stay, his mom said no. So there's an inconsistency here\u2014his friends can't stay, but the other kid can. That might be a point of frustration. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The key is whether the author's reaction is unreasonable. From the story, the author didn't say they were against the sleepover itself but against the lack of prior notice and the decision being made without their input. The parents might have their reasons, like the friend's child wants to stay over, but the child's autonomy and planning for their birthday should be considered. \n\nIn terms of fairness, children do have a right to feel heard, especially regarding their own events. If the parents made this decision without considering their child's feelings or the impact on the party plans, that's a problem. The author's frustration is about being treated as if their preferences don't matter. So, maybe the parents are in the wrong, not the author. The author isn't being unreasonable for wanting to be involved in the decision-making process for their own party. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author is expressing a valid concern about lack of communication and autonomy. The parents should have discussed this with the child beforehand, especially since it's their birthday. The answer is B.\n"
