I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party being planned, and the son is upset that his dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at his house without his input.\n\nFirst, the son wanted a party for his friends. His mom had previously signed him up for a camp trip on his birthday, so maybe he's sensitive about his birthday plans. Now, his dad invited this friend's kid, who then decided to stay the night. The parents agreed to it yesterday and told the son today. The son is upset because he doesn't like last-minute surprises and feels he should have been informed earlier. He's also upset because he asked if his friends could stay the night, and the mom said no, which contrasts with the sudden approval for the other kid.\n\nThe son's main issues are lack of prior notice and not having a say. He's not against the kid staying, just the way it was handled. The parents' actions here might be seen as not respecting his wishes, especially since they knew about the party and the kid's potential stay. However, the kid's request was made yesterday, and the parents decided to approve it, perhaps without considering the son's perspective.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about communication. The parents should have discussed this earlier with their son, given that it's his house and his birthday party. The son's feelings are valid because he values being included in decisions affecting his space and event. The parents' lack of communication could be seen as the main issue here, not necessarily the son being in the wrong. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
