I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset that a friend of their dad's son is having a sleepover at their house on their birthday party. The key points here are the author's desire for their birthday party and their dislike for last-minute surprises.\n\nFirst, the author planned a birthday party and invited friends to play Smash Ultimate. The dad invited his friend's kid without consulting the author, and the kid decided to stay the night. The author is upset because they weren't informed in time and feel like they don't have a choice. They also mention being against the kid staying not because of the kid itself, but because of the lack of prior communication and the inconsistency (their friends can't stay).\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's feelings are valid because they had plans and were excluded from the decision-making process. The parents made decisions that affect the author's personal event without including them. The author's frustration stems from not being respected in their own home for their special day. The parent's actions could be seen as dismissive of the author's preferences, especially when the author had already made their own plans. The fact that the author was not allowed to have their friends stay adds to the sense of unfairness.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents thought it was a nice gesture to include the kid, but they should have considered the author's feelings and involved them in the decision. Since the author is an adolescent (based on the context), the parents might think they're making good decisions, but the author's autonomy is important here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a right to be upset about their own party being affected without their consent. The parents and the dad's friend's son might share some responsibility here for not communicating properly. The author's frustration is justified, so the answer would be B, No.\n"
