I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a birthday party and a sleepover that the author wasn't informed about in advance. The author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, which is their birthday. They had planned to invite friends for Smash Ultimate, and the kid's parents and dad just decided this yesterday and told them today. The author doesn't like surprises and wants to be informed in time. They also asked if their friends could stay, but their mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were planning a birthday party and wanted it to be special after last year's camp trip mishap. The sudden addition of a guest they didn't agree to could disrupt their plans. They might feel their autonomy is being ignored by not being given a choice. The fact that their mom denied their friends staying might add to their frustration, making the situation feel unfair.\n\nNow, the other side: the dad's friend's son is around 10, and the parents might have made the decision without asking the author. The dad might have thought it was okay, but not considering the author's feelings. However, the author is being asked to host a sleepover, which is a common thing in many families, even if unexpected. The question is whether the author has a right to be upset. They are not against the sleepover itself but the way it was decided without their input.\n\nIs it reasonable to expect to be informed earlier? Yes, especially if it's a birthday party where the author is inviting friends. Not being informed in time could make them feel their event is being overshadowed. The author's feelings about not liking surprises and wanting to be involved in decisions about their own home are valid. On the other hand, maybe the parents should have considered the author's plans more when making the invitation. \n\nThe key issue is the lack of communication and the author's right to have their preferences respected. Since the author is old enough to be planning a party and inviting friends, being excluded from the decision-making about their own space might be a problem. The parents might be in the wrong for not consulting the author first. However, the author's reaction could be seen as valid because they were not consulted and their event is impacted. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they have a legitimate grievance. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
