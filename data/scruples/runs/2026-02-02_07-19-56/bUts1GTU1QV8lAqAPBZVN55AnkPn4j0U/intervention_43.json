I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house the next day without them being informed in time. The author wanted to invite their friends to stay over, but the parents said no. They're frustrated about the lack of communication and feeling like they have no choice.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they really wanted the party to happen because last year their mom did something without telling them. This context is important because it shows a pattern of not being consulted, which might make the author more sensitive this time. \n\nThe dad allowed the friend's son to stay overnight without giving the author enough notice. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but is upset about the lack of prior discussion and the sudden decision. They also wanted their friends to stay but were denied, which adds to their frustration. \n\nFrom the parent's perspective, maybe they thought it was okay to let the friend's son stay since he's a family friend's child. However, not involving the author in the decision-making process might be problematic, especially since the author values being informed beforehand. \n\nThe author's feelings about not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in a timely manner are valid. They have a right to feel upset if their preferences are being overlooked. The parents might be making assumptions about what's best without considering the author's wishes. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're expressing their feelings about a situation where they feel their autonomy is being disregarded. The parents might need to communicate better and involve the author in such decisions. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
