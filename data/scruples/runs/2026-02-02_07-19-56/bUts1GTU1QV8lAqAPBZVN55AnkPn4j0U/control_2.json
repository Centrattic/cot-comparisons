I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's dad invited a friend's son for a sleepover, and the author wasn't told about it. The author is upset because they wanted to have their birthday party with friends and didn't like the surprise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had planned their birthday party and invited friends. The dad's friend's son is coming without the author's input, and they were told about it right before. The author feels it's unfair because they didn't have a choice, especially since they wanted their friends to stay over but the mom said no.\n\nThe author isn't against the kid staying, just the lack of communication and not being consulted. They mentioned disliking surprises and wanting to be informed in a timely manner. The parents made the decision without considering the child's preference for their own party. \n\nFrom a child's perspective, it's reasonable to expect that their own birthday plans would be respected. The parents might have thought they were being kind by allowing a friend's son to stay, but not involving the child in the decision could be an oversight. The author's frustration stems from the lack of communication and control over their own event.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong? The parents should have discussed the plans with the child, especially since it's their birthday and they're hosting the party. The author's feelings are valid because they wanted to be involved in the decision-making process. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
