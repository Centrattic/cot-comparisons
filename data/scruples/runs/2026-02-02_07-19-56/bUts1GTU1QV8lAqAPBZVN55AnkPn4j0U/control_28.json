I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their birthday party. They wanted to have a game night with friends, but their dad's friend's son is coming over for a sleepover, which they weren't told about in time. The user is upset because they didn't get a choice and they don't like surprises.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user planned their birthday party and invited friends. The dad made a decision without consulting the child, allowing a 10-year-old to stay over. The user feels it's unfair because they weren't informed in advance and they can't have their friends stay. They mentioned not liking surprises, which is a valid preference for many people.\n\nThe parents' actions here are questionable. They agreed to the sleepover yesterday and told the child today, which is last-minute. The user didn't get a chance to prepare or say yes or no. Also, the parents allowed the guest without considering the user's preferences, especially since they had previously booked a camp against the child's wishes. This pattern of making decisions without the child's input might be the issue here.\n\nThe user isn't against the guest staying but the lack of communication and choice. It's reasonable to want to be informed and have a say in your own birthday plans. The parents' actions here might be seen as dismissive of the child's feelings. The user's frustration is about being included in decisions that affect them directly.\n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the user isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their right to be heard and to have their preferences considered. The parents are the ones not respecting the child's autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
