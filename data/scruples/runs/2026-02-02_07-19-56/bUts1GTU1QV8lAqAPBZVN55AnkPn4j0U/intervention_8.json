I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday, which they're upset about because they wanted a party with friends and didn't like the surprise.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's birthday is tomorrow, and they were planning a Smash Ultimate party. They didn't know about the sleepover until today, even though the dad and the friend agreed yesterday. The author is upset because they don't like last-minute surprises and wanted to know in advance. They also mention that when they asked if their friends could stay, their mom said no, which adds to their frustration.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they were planning their birthday, wanted to have their friends over, and now there's an unexpected guest. They feel like they don't have a choice in the matter. The issue is about being informed in a timely manner and having their plans affected. \n\nOn the other hand, the dad and the friend's son might have thought it was a nice gesture to include their child, especially since the author's parent is involved. The dad might not have considered the author's feelings about the surprise. The friend's son is 10, which is a bit younger than the author, but maybe they know each other. The mom's refusal for the author's friends to stay might be due to practical reasons like space or rules.\n\nThe author's main complaint is about the lack of communication and the sudden addition. Is that valid? Well, it's important to respect someone's opinion in their own space, especially on a special day. If the author communicated to their parents that they wanted a specific kind of party and didn't want surprises, the parents should have respected that. However, if the parents didn't communicate the plans in time, that's on them. The author's frustration is understandable if they feel their wishes were ignored. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They're upset about a surprise they didn't like. They might be being a bit self-centered, thinking their birthday is the only important event. However, if the parents didn't check with the author about the sleepover first, that's a problem. The author's desire to have their friends stay and the inconsistency in the parents' decisions (yes to the friend's son, no to the author's friends) could be a point. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions were reasonable. The author didn't do anything wrong by being upset. The wrong might lie with the parents for not involving the author in the decision. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since they're expressing their feelings and not taking any action beyond being upset, they're not in the wrong. They have a right to be upset if their wishes were disregarded. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
