I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a birthday party where the author's dad's friend's son is having a sleepover, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author wanted a birthday party to play Smash Ultimate. They invited friends, but the dad's friend's son was also invited without the author knowing until right before. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and feel they weren't given a choice. They also mention that when they asked if their friends could stay over, their mom said no, which adds to the frustration.\n\nThe key points here are about autonomy and communication. The author wanted control over their own party, including who's invited and what the plans are. Their dad made a decision without consulting them, which is a common issue in parent-child dynamics. The author isn't against the guest itself but the lack of prior communication and the sudden change. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is now seeking a second opinion. From a typical AITA perspective, parents often have the authority to make decisions about their children's events, especially when it comes to safety or other considerations. However, the author's feelings about not being consulted and the inconsistency (allowing the friend's son to stay but not their own friends) might tip the balance.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the child's right to have their preferences considered is balanced against parental judgment. Here, the dad's decision to invite a friend's child without discussing it with the author first, especially when the author was trying to plan their own party, could be seen as dismissive of the author's wishes. The fact that the author is trying to communicate their boundaries (by asking about their friends staying over) and the parents' conflicting responses might support the author's position.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons to be upset about the lack of communication and the inconsistency in rules. The parents' actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, didn't take the author's preferences into account. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
