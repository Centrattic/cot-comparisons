I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday party where the person is upset that their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house without their knowledge. The author wants to know if they're the a**hole.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author's birthday is tomorrow, and they've invited friends to play Smash Ultimate. The parents mentioned the kid from the dad's friend coming over, and now the kid wants to stay the night, which the dad agreed to. The author is upset because they weren't informed in time and feel like they have no choice. They also mention that they asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no.\n\nSo, the main points here are: lack of prior notice, the sudden addition of a guest they didn't choose, and possible inconsistency in the parents' decisions (friends can't stay but the other kid can). \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't like surprises and want to be informed in time. The parents might have thought it's a minor detail or assumed the author wouldn't mind. The kid's decision to stay overnight was made by the parents, not the author, so the author feels their autonomy is being undermined. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the parents' responsibility in communicating and the author's right to have their own space and input. Since it's their house and their birthday party, the parents should have discussed the guest list with them. Not informing them ahead of time and adding a guest that wasn't part of their planned party could be seen as dismissive of the author's preferences. \n\nThe author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of consultation and the sudden change. The parents' decision to allow the other kid's sleepover while denying the author's friends' requests might be seen as unfair, which adds to the author's frustration. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the parents didn't respect the author's wishes regarding the guest list and the communication. The author is within their rights to feel upset about being left out of the decision-making process. So, the parents might be in the wrong for not involving their child in the planning, especially for their own party. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't the a**hole here. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
