I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. So the situation is about their birthday party.\n\nThe author wanted to have friends over to play Smash Ultimate tomorrow. But their dad's friend's 10-year-old son is coming as a sleepover, which was decided yesterday and told to the author today. The author doesn't like surprises and the fact that they weren't consulted in time. They also asked if their invited friends could stay overnight, but the mom said no. The author is upset about the last-minute notice and not having a choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the unexpected sleepover. The author planned their party but didn't get to know about the additional guest until now. They feel it's unfair because they weren't given a say. The parents arranged it without checking with the author. \n\nThe author isn't against the kid staying; they're just upset about the lack of notice and the sudden decision. They were planning their own event, which might be disrupted. Their mom's previous action (signing them up for camp) adds to the frustration. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a right to be upset about not being informed in time, especially if it affects their plans. The parents might not have considered the author's feelings or the setup of the party. Also, the author's friends can't stay, which might create an imbalance. \n\nOn the other hand, sometimes parents make decisions for their kids, and maybe the friend's son is a regular visitor. But the key here is the timing and the lack of communication. The author's request to have their friends stay was denied, which could make them feel their voice isn't heard. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because they are justified in being upset about unexpected plans and not having a choice. The parents should have communicated better and considered the author's input, especially since it's their birthday party. The fact that they were previously surprised by the camp trip adds to the reason the author is sensitive to surprises. They have a right to expect their own plans to be respected and for decisions that affect them to be made with their input.\n"
