So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their dad inviting a friend's son (around 10 years old) for a sleepover at the author's house on their birthday. The author had planned a party with friends to play Smash Ultimate because last year their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them. Now, the dad's friend's son is coming without the author being consulted in a timely manner. The author is upset about the lack of communication and the inconsistency in allowing their own friends to stay over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is upset about the surprise guest. They wanted to know in advance about the sleepover. The parent made the decision without consulting them, and when the author asked if their friends could stay, the parent said no. The author is not against the kid staying but is against the lack of notice and the inconsistency in the rules.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, they might think that inviting a friend's child for a sleepover is a favor or a way to maintain social connections. However, the author is a teenager (since they have a birthday party and play games like Smash). Teenagers often value their independence and want to have a say in their social plans, especially after a past experience where their autonomy was disregarded (the camp trip). The inconsistency in the rules (allowing the friend's son but not the author's friends) might also contribute to the author's frustration.\n\nThe author's main issues are:\n1. Not being informed in a timely manner about the sleepover.\n2. Feeling that they have no choice in the matter.\n3. The parent's inconsistency in allowing guests to stay.\n\nThe parent's actions could be seen as dismissive of the author's plans and feelings. The author had a legitimate reason to be upset given the past experience with the camp trip, which suggests a pattern of parents making decisions without the author's input. The parent's refusal to allow the author's friends to stay might also be a point of contention, adding to the feeling of unfairness.\n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting a teenager's wishes regarding their own social events is important. Parents usually have the authority to make decisions, but when it comes to their child's birthday plans, especially when the child has expressed a desire for something specific, the parent should consider the child's perspective. The fact that the author had to ask and was denied for their own friends but the parent allowed another child's sleepover without consultation might be seen as favoritism or inconsistency.\n\nHowever, the parent might argue that the friend's son is their guest, and they wanted to accommodate their mutual friend. But even so, the lack of communication and the author's valid feelings about their birthday being important should be taken into account. The parent could have discussed the sleepover with the author in advance, especially since the author has a history of being upset about unexpected plans.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is justified in being upset. The parent made a decision that affected the author's social plans without proper consideration of the author's feelings and wishes. The inconsistency in allowing guests is also a factor. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
