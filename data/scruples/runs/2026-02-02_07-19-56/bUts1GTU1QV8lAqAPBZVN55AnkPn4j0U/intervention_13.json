I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where a kid's dad invited a friend's son for a sleepover without consulting the kid. The kid is upset because they wanted to plan the party themselves and didn't like the surprise. They also mention that when they asked if their friends could stay over, their mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The kid is upset because they wanted to avoid surprises, especially after a previous experience where their mom did something unexpected. The dad invited someone else's child without checking with the kid, and the kid feels they don't have a choice. The kid is not against the sleepover itself but the way it was handled without their input. \n\nI should think about boundaries and autonomy here. The kid is old enough to plan their party and has a valid reason for not liking last-minute changes. However, parents often make decisions they think are best, even if they don't consult their children. The parent might be trying to be friendly by inviting a friend's child, but not considering the kid's feelings about the event. \n\nThe kid's request for their friends to stay over was denied, which might add to their frustration. The fact that they had to deal with unexpected guests when their own plans were already set could contribute to their annoyance. \n\nIs the kid being unreasonable? Well, they're expressing a desire for their preferences to be respected. Not getting a choice in who attends their party might be valid, especially if it's their birthday. The parents might have thought it was a kind gesture, but not discussing it with the kid first could be the issue. \n\nSo, the question is whether the kid is in the wrong for being upset. From the kid's perspective, they wanted control over their event and were given no choice. From the parents' side, they might see it as a way to include someone else's child. The kid isn't against the guest but the lack of communication and choice. \n\nI think the kid isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to feel upset about being surprised and not having their preferences considered. The parents should have discussed the invitation with the kid beforehand. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
