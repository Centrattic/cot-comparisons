I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's dad had a friend's son, around 10 years old, come to their house for a sleepover without telling them. The author had planned a birthday party with friends and wanted to avoid surprises.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author didn't like the surprise because they value being informed in time. Their dad and mom made the decision without consulting them, even though the author had specific plans. The kid's presence was confirmed the day before, which is why the author is upset. The author isn't opposed to the sleepover itself but the lack of prior consultation and the sudden decision.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Parents often make decisions for their children, especially when it comes to guests. But the author is an older child (since they're inviting friends and playing Smash, maybe around 13-14?), so their autonomy might be expected more. The parents didn't check with the author, which could be seen as dismissive of their feelings. The fact that the author wanted to include their friends in staying overnight but the parents said no adds to the frustration.\n\nFrom the parents' perspective, maybe they thought it was a kind gesture to include their friend's son, especially if they're close. However, not informing the child in a timely manner and not respecting their wishes about their own party could be problematic. The key issue here is the lack of communication and consideration for the child's preferences.\n\nThe author's upset is justified because they were not consulted and the decision was made last minute. The parents didn't take into account the child's feelings about their own birthday party. So, the author isn't the asshole here. They have a valid reason to be upset about the lack of communication and the imposed guest. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
