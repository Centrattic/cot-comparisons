I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset that their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, which is their birthday. They had planned a party with friends to play Smash Ultimate. The issue is that the dad and his friend's son decided on the sleepover yesterday and only told the author today. The author doesn't like surprises and wants to be informed in advance. They also mention that they asked if their friends could stay overnight, and the mom said no. So they're frustrated that they have no choice in the matter.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the author is wrong. The key points here are the lack of notice, the fact that it's their birthday, and the inconsistency in allowing their friends to stay. The author is upset because they wanted to celebrate their birthday with their friends but now there's an unexpected guest. Their parents are making the decision without considering their preferences. \n\nThe dad made the decision without consulting the author adequately. The author was planning their own party and the surprise might disrupt that. Also, the fact that the parents said no to their friends staying over but allowed another kid to stay could be seen as unfair. The author's main issue is the lack of control over their birthday plans and the sudden change. \n\nBut then, maybe the author is being a bit unreasonable? They should have communicated earlier about not wanting the other kid to come? Or is the parent's decision not considering the author's wishes the main issue here? The author did ask about their friends staying, and the mom said no, but the dad still allowed the other kid. That might be a point where the parents didn't listen to their child's preferences. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about whose actions were more inconsiderate. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of notice and not being consulted. The parents are making decisions without giving the child a say, which is a common issue in parent-child dynamics. \n\nSo, the author is justified in being upset because their birthday plans are being affected without their input. The parents might be at fault here for not considering their child's wishes. Therefore, the author isn't the one in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
