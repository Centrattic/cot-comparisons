I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover without the author being informed in time. The author wanted to invite their friends to stay over but the parents said no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is upset about the surprise guest. They mentioned disliking last-minute surprises, especially since their mom previously did something similar with the camp trip. The dad and mom allowed the friend's son to stay overnight after agreeing yesterday, and they told the author today. The author feels they should have been informed earlier and also wanted their friends to stay, but the parents refused.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate it. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's main issue is about lack of communication and surprise guests. The parents made a decision without consulting the author, which led to the surprise. The author is expressing frustration about not having a choice and not being informed in time. The other kid's parent might have wanted their child to stay, and the parents of the author decided without asking the author. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, they have a right to feel that way, especially if they were expecting a certain setup for their party. However, the parents might have their reasons, like accommodating a friend's child. The author also expressed their desire for their friends to stay, but the parents said no. That could be a point of contention as well. \n\nBut the main point here is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. In terms of responsibility, the parents should have communicated with the author before making such a decision, especially since the author has a history of being surprised by decisions (like the camp trip). The author's feelings are valid because they wanted to plan their party and had their expectations set. The parents' lack of communication is more at fault here. The author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset; they have a legitimate grievance. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parents failed to communicate properly, and the author's feelings are justified. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to know in advance and not wanting unexpected guests ruining their planned party. The parents should have considered the author's preferences and discussed it before making the decision.\n"
