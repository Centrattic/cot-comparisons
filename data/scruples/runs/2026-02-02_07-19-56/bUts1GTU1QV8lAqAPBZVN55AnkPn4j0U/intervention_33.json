I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about a friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday. The author's birthday party is tomorrow, and they invited friends to play Smash Ultimate. The issue is that the dad's friend's son (around 10) is coming, and the author found out yesterday when the dad agreed. They don't like surprises and wanted to know in time, but they can't stop the kid from staying. They also asked if their friends could stay, and the mom said no.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is upset because they were not informed in time about the sleepover. They want to know if they should be upset. The parent made the decision without consulting the child, which is a common issue. The author's frustration is about lack of communication and autonomy in their own party planning. The kid's parent's son is coming as a guest, but the author is the one hosting. \n\nThe author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of prior notice and the fact that their own friends aren't allowed to stay. The parent's decision to approve the sleepover without input from the child might be an issue. The author is within their rights to feel upset about being excluded from decisions affecting their own event. However, maybe the parent had a reason to allow the friend's son, like family dynamics or the child's request. But the author's feelings are valid because they were blindsided. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents made the decision, not the author. The author is reacting to a situation they can't control. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Since the issue is about communication and respecting the child's wishes, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. The problem lies with the parents not considering the child's preferences. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
