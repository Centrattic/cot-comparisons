I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the kid is upset because his dad's friend's son is having a sleepover without him being informed in time. The kid wanted to avoid surprises and didn't like that he wasn't given a choice, even though he's not against the sleepover itself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wanted a party to make up for last year's bad experience. His parents didn't inform him until the day before about the friend's son staying over. The kid didn't get a chance to plan for this or adjust his invitations. He also mentioned that his mom refused to let his friends stay, which seems inconsistent.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents might be responsible for not communicating properly and not respecting his wishes for his party. However, the kid is expressing frustration about the lack of communication and the sudden change. Is it fair for him to be upset? Probably yes. He has a right to know in advance about such things, especially since it's his party and his space. The fact that his friends aren't allowed to stay might add to his frustration, making the situation unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's son's family might be expecting a sleepover, and the parents might have thought it was okay. But the kid's feelings about not being consulted and the surprise aspect are valid. So the parents might be at fault here for not involving him in the decision. The author is not in the wrong for being upset about this. So the answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
