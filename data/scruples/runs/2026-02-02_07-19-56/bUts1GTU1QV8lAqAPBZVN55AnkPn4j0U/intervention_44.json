I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house on their birthday without them being properly informed. They wanted a Smash Ultimate party and had invited friends, but the kid's stay was decided the day before and they found out late. The key points here are the lack of notice and the fact that they were excluded from the decision-making.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't like surprises and want to be told things in time. Since the decision was made the day before and they found out the same day, that's a short notice. The parent's friend might have good intentions, but the way it's handled could be seen as not considering the child's feelings. Also, the author's friends weren't allowed to stay, which might add to their frustration.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parent's friend's son is a guest, but the host (the author) should have some say in their own party. However, since it's their parent's house, the parents might have the final say. The author's objection is about not being consulted in time and feeling like they have no choice. \n\nIn some cases, parents might prioritize their social obligations or friends, but if the child's event is being disrupted, that's a valid concern. The fact that the author tried to include their friends and was denied by the mom might make their stance more understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're expressing their feelings about a situation where they were not given enough notice and their preferences were not respected. The parents or the friend's family might be at fault for not coordinating better. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
