I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AskReddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author's dad's friend's son is having a sleepover, which was decided without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because they wanted their friends to stay over too, but the parents said no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is upset about a surprise sleepover from a stranger's kid, which they didn't agree to. They feel it's unfair because they asked to have their friends stay, and the parents refused. They mention disliking surprises and needing time to prepare. \n\nThe parents are making the decisions here. The dad invited the friend's son, and the mom didn't let the author's friends stay. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and being excluded from the decision-making process. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, they have a right to feel that way if they didn't know until last minute. They wanted to have their friends stay, which was denied, while someone else's kid is allowed. The parents might be prioritizing their own relationships, but the author's feelings about their own birthday party are valid. \n\nThe parents might be in the wrong for not involving the author in the planning, especially since it's their birthday. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to know in advance and to have their friends stay. It's a valid complaint. So the answer would be that the author isn't the a-hole. They have a right to be upset about the sudden change and the double standard in allowing friends to stay.\n"
