I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset that their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, which was decided without their input. The author had planned a birthday party with friends, wanted the party to happen since last year's incident where their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 13 or 14 (assuming from the context), and they wanted their birthday party to be a certain way. The dad invited the friend's son, who then decided to have a sleepover. The parents approved, and the author found out only the day before. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and weren't consulted. They also mention that when they asked if their friends could stay, the mom said no. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFrom the story, the parents made a decision without informing the child, which affected their plans. The child is upset because they value being informed in time and not having things sprung on them last minute. They also feel it's unfair that the friend's son can stay but their own friends can't. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents should have considered their child's feelings and plans. The child is within their rights to express frustration, especially since they were not given a choice. The parents didn't check with them about the sleepover, which is a significant event. The child's request for their friends to stay was denied, adding to the unfairness they feel. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. They have valid reasons for feeling this way. The parents might be at fault here for not communicating properly. The author is reacting to a situation that was handled poorly by adults. The key here is whether the author's reaction is unreasonable. Since they wanted transparency and felt their preferences were ignored, their upset is justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
