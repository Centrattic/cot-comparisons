I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about a friend of their dad's son having a sleepover at their birthday party. The author wanted to have their own party with friends, but their parents didn't tell them until just before about the extra guest. They're upset because they don't like surprises and didn't get a say.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's main points are about not being informed in time and not having control over their own space. Their parents might have thought it was a good idea to invite the kid, maybe to keep the author's dad's friend's son included or to avoid being rude. But the author is upset because they wanted their birthday party to be about their friends and the game. \n\nThe key here is the lack of communication. The parents decided on the sleepover the day before and only told the author that day. The author had already planned to invite their friends, and the sudden addition of an unexpected guest disrupts that plan. Also, the author mentions they were not against the guest staying but were upset about the lack of prior notice and not being consulted. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author has a right to be involved in decisions about their own home, especially on their birthday. Parents might have good intentions, but making a child feel like they have no choice in their own space can be frustrating. The fact that the author's friends can't stay over while another child can adds to the feeling of unfairness. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents thought it was a kind gesture to include their friend's child. But the main issue here is the communication and the child's autonomy. The author isn't being unreasonable in wanting to know in advance and to have a say. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their feelings.\n"
