I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about a sleepover at their house during their birthday. The author's birthday party is tomorrow, and they wanted to invite friends to play Smash Ultimate. But their dad's friend's son, around 10 years old, is coming for a sleepover, which was agreed upon yesterday and told to the author today. The author doesn't like surprises and feels they should have been informed earlier. They also mention that when they asked if their friends could stay over, the mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is upset about the last-minute surprise. They wanted to plan their party, and the addition of this kid without prior notice disrupts that. The parent's decision to allow the sleepover without consulting the author might be the main issue. The author isn't opposed to the sleepover itself but the lack of notice and input. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the situation seems to revolve around communication. The parents didn't check with the author before making the decision, which is a problem. The kid's dad is a friend, so maybe the parents felt it was okay, but the author has a right to be involved in planning their own party. The fact that the author asked about their friends staying and was denied shows they have preferences that weren't respected. \n\nSurprises can be nice, but they need to be respectful of the person's wishes. The author's frustration is about control and communication. They wanted to be told in time, not right before. The parents might be trying to help but not considering the author's feelings. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to be upset because their input was not considered, leading to a last-minute change. The parents' actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, were inconsiderate. Therefore, the author's feelings are justified.\n"
