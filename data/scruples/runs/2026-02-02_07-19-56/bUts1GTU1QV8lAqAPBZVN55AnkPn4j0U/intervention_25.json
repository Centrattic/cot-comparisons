I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a birthday party where the author didn't get a say in a friend staying over, even though they wanted to invite their friends to stay. The parent made the decision about the friend's son without consulting the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issues are: not being informed in time about the sleepover, and feeling they don't have a choice. They also mention their mom said \"no\" to their friends staying, which adds to their frustration.\n\nThe parents decided on the last minute about the friend's son, so maybe that's part of the problem. The author isn't against the kid staying but the way it was handled. They value being informed in advance and having some control over their own event. \n\nIs it fair for the parents to make that decision without consulting their child? If the parents are hosting the party, maybe they have the authority to set the rules. But the author is a teenager, so their feelings about autonomy might matter. The fact that the author was upset about last year's birthday issue (the camp trip) might also play a role in their current reaction. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being unreasonable. If the parents allowed the friend's son to stay without checking with the kid, maybe that's an oversight. However, the author did ask about their friends staying and was told no. So the parents might have reasons for their rules. \n\nThe author's frustration seems valid because they wanted to have their own party and the sudden addition of someone else's kid without prior notice disrupts their plans. But is it the author's fault for being upset? Or is the issue with the parents not involving their child in decisions about the party?\n\nI think the parents are partly at fault here for not discussing the guest with the child. The author isn't wrong for wanting to know in advance. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). They have a right to feel upset about the lack of communication and autonomy.\n"
