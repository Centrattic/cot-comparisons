I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a birthday party where the author's dad allowed a friend's son to stay over without the author's consent, even though the author had planned the party with friends. The key points here are about autonomy and communication.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because they didn't get a say in the decision. They wanted their friends to stay over, but their mom said no. They feel like they're being treated unfairly. The dad and the friend's son made the decision without consulting the author, which the author dislikes. The parent's actions here might be seen as not respecting the author's wishes, even if their intention was to include the friend's son.\n\nThe author isn't against the sleepover itself but is against the lack of prior communication. That's a valid point. People generally feel respected when they're included in decisions that affect them. The parent's failure to inform the author in a timely manner and to consider their preferences could be seen as the issue here, not the author's reaction.\n\nSo, the author's frustration is about being excluded from the decision-making process. They wanted to plan the party with their friends, and the sudden addition without their input is causing them stress. The parents' response was to say no to the author's friends staying over, which adds to the feeling of unfairness.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's reaction seems reasonable given the circumstances. They're not being unreasonable about the sleepover itself but are upset about the lack of communication and autonomy. The parents might be at fault here for not considering the author's perspective and the previous incident with the camp trip. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
