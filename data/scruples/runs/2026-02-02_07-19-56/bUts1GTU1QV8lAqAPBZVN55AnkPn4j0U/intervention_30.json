I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party. The author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, which they didn't get to know about in time. The kid decided on the sleepover, and the parents said yes without informing the author properly.\n\nThe author mentions they don't like surprises and wanted to be told in advance. Their friends aren't allowed to stay, which adds to their frustration. They aren't against the kid staying but are upset about the lack of communication and choice. \n\nNow, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The parents made a decision without consulting the child, especially regarding their own birthday party. The kid's sleepover was arranged just a day before, and the author wasn't given a say. On the other hand, the author might be overreacting because it's a family friend's child. \n\nBut considering that the birthday is the author's event and they had planned it, the parents should have considered their feelings. The key issues are lack of communication and not including the child in the decision. The author's desire for control over their own event is reasonable. The parents' actions might be seen as dismissive of the child's preferences. \n\nSo, the author isn't the one in the wrong here. The parents and the friend's son might share some responsibility. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
