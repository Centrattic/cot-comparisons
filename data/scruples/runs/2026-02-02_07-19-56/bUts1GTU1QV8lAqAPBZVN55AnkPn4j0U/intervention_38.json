I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house. The author had planned to invite friends for a Smash Ultimate game session, but the dad just let the friend's kid stay overnight without consulting the author. The author feels it's a surprise and they don't like not having a say, especially since they asked if their friends could stay and the mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 10 years old? Wait, no, the kid from the dad's friend is 10. Wait, the author's age isn't specified, but the kid from the friend is 10. The author's birthday is tomorrow, and they wanted a party. The dad allowed the friend's kid to stay overnight without telling the author in advance. The author is upset because they don't like last-minute surprises and feel they should have been given a choice. Also, the author's mom said no to their friends staying over, which might add to the frustration.\n\nSo, the main issue is the lack of communication and inclusion in the decision-making. The author feels their preferences were overlooked. The parent's perspective might be that they're accommodating a friend's request, and maybe they think it's okay since the kid is just staying one night. But the author is upset because they had plans and wanted control over their party. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? At their age, having a say in their own party's arrangements is reasonable. If the parent had discussed it with them beforehand, maybe they could have made different arrangements. The fact that the friend's kid decided on the sleepover and the dad agreed without consulting the author is probably the core issue. The author's request to let their friends stay was denied, which the mom said no to, which might make the situation worse because their own friends aren't allowed to stay, but another kid is. That could feel unfair.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're expressing their feelings about being consulted and having their party plans affected. The parents might not have considered the author's perspective here. The author's frustration is valid, especially since they wanted to avoid surprises after a previous bad experience with the camp trip. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
