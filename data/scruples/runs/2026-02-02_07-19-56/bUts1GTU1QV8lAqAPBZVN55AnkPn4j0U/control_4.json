I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a birthday party where the author's dad's friend's son is having a sleepover without the author's prior knowledge.\n\nFirst, the author wanted a party to make up for last year's camp trip. They invited friends but were told about the sleepover last minute. The main issue is that the author dislikes surprises and didn't have a say in the guest list. The parents agreed to the sleepover yesterday and only told the author today. The author is upset because they wanted to know in advance and feel like they have no control over their own party.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I should consider the key points. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the lack of communication and the sudden decision. The parents made the choice without involving the author, which is understandable since parents might want to include their friend's child. However, the author had planned the party, and the surprise might disrupt their plans. The author's request for other friends to stay was denied, which adds to their frustration.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's feelings are valid. They wanted to be included in the decision-making process. The parents might have good intentions, but not informing the author in a timely manner is a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to know in advance and having some control over their own event. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their concerns are about communication and personal space in their own party.\n"
