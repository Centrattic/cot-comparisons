I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is having a birthday party for their friends to play Smash Ultimate. Their dad invited a friend's son (around 10 years old) to have a sleepover at their house the same night. The author found out about this last minute and is upset because they didn't get a choice in the matter. They mention not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in time. They also tried to ask if their friends could stay the night, but their mom said no.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author wanted their party to be with their friends, but their dad's friend's son is coming as a sleepover guest. The author is upset because they weren't consulted in advance and had to find out close to the event. The parent's decision might be seen as not respecting the author's wishes, especially since it's their birthday. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author is a child, and their parent made a decision that affects their event. The parent might believe they're being generous by allowing the friend's son to stay, but they didn't consider the author's feelings or the event's purpose. The author's frustration comes from not being involved in the decision-making process, which is valid, especially if it's their birthday party. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They are upset because they wanted control over their own party. The parent should have discussed it with them. The author isn't against the sleepover per se but the lack of consultation and the surprise element. Their mom even denied their request to have their friends stay, which adds to the frustration. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent made a decision that overrides the child's plan. The author's feelings are valid because they were planning a specific event. So, maybe the parent is at fault for not involving the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because their reaction is about being overlooked in a situation that's their event. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
