I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover, and they were told last minute. The key points here are about the author's feelings of being excluded from decisions affecting their own party and the lack of prior notice.\n\nFirst, the author wanted the party to happen because last year their mom signed them up for a camp without asking. That shows they value having control over their own plans. This year, the dad invited the kid without consulting the author, and the kid decided to stay overnight. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and wanted to be informed in time. They also mention that when they asked if their friends could stay, the mom said no, which adds to their frustration.\n\nThe author isn't against the kid staying per se, just the way it was arranged without their input. The main issue is about autonomy and being informed in a timely manner. Since it's their birthday and the party is at their house, there's an expectation that they should have some say in who's invited, especially for a sleepover. The parents made the decision without considering the author's preferences, which could be seen as dismissive of their feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad and friend might have thought it was a nice gesture to include the kid. But the author's right to have their wishes respected is important. The fact that the author was denied the opportunity to invite their own friends to stay overnight shows a discrepancy in how the parents handled guest permissions, which might contribute to feeling like they're being treated unfairly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons to be upset about not being included in the decision-making process and the last-minute notice. The parents might be at fault here for not checking in with the author. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
