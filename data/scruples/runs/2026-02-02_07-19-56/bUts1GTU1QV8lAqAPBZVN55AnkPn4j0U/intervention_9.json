I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author's dad's friend's son is having a sleepover, which the author is upset about because it was a surprise and they weren't given a choice.\n\nFirst, the author mentions not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in time. They wanted their own friends to stay over, but the mom said no. The key points here are about communication and autonomy. The author's parents made a decision without involving them, especially right before the event. The author's frustration seems to stem from being excluded from the decision-making, not necessarily the sleepover itself. They aren't against the kid staying but are upset about the lack of prior notice and input.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to evaluate if the author overreacted or if their feelings are valid. Teenagers often value their independence and privacy, so being forced into hosting someone they didn't choose could be a legitimate issue. The parents didn't consult the author, which might be the main problem here. The author didn't do anything wrong; they're upset because their wishes and boundaries weren't respected. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
