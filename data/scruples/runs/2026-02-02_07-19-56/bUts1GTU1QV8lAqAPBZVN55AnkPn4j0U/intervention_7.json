I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, which is the author's birthday. The author had planned a party for some friends to play Smash Ultimate, which they really wanted since last year their birthday plans were messed up by a camp trip they didn't know about. The parent told them about the sleepover just yesterday and today, and the author is upset because they didn't get to know earlier and feel they have no choice. They also mention that when they asked if their friends could stay over, the mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a teenager (maybe around 13-14 if the friend is 10), and their birthday is tomorrow. They wanted a planned party but feel blindsided by the sleepover. The parents might be involved in making the decision without consulting the author enough.\n\nThe author's main issue is not the sleepover itself but the lack of notice and input. They mention they don't like surprises and want decisions made in time. The parents agreed to the sleepover yesterday and told the author today, which is very last minute. The author is also upset that their friends aren't allowed to stay, while someone else is. \n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they might be trying to socialize the author with their dad's friend's kid, but they didn't check in with the author's preferences. The author's frustration is valid because they had their own plans and didn't get to participate in the decision-making. The fact that the parents said no to their friends staying but allowed another child to stay might add to the unfairness they feel.\n\nHowever, the author is being a bit demanding\u2014maybe expecting more autonomy than they're used to. But considering their age and the fact that they were excited about the party, the parents should have involved them in the decision earlier. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the circumstances around it. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're being reasonable in wanting to know earlier and having input, then they're not. If they're being selfish by not wanting the sleepover at all, but the problem is the timing and lack of choice, then they're not. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). They have valid reasons for being upset, and the parents didn't communicate properly.\n"
