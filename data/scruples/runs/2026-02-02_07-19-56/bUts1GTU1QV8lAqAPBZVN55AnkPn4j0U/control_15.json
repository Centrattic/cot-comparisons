I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday, which they were planning to have a party with friends. The author is upset because they were told about the sleepover too late, and they didn't get a choice in the matter. They also mention that when they asked to have their friends stay over, their mom said no.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue seems to be the lack of prior notice and not being involved in the decision. They wanted time to prepare and adjust their plans. From their perspective, it's a surprise that they didn't like because they don't like surprises. The dad and mom made the decision without considering the author's preferences, especially since it's their birthday. \n\nThe author isn't against the sleepover itself but the way it was arranged without their input. They wanted to have their own friends stay, but that was denied. So there's a bit of inconsistency from the parents\u2014allowing the son of a friend to stay but not the author's friends. That might be a point in the author's favor because it shows favoritism or inconsistency in the parents' decisions.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is being unreasonable by being upset. They have a right to feel that their plans are important, especially on their birthday. The parents didn't communicate early enough, and not involving them in a decision that affects their space and plans. The child's right to have their own celebration without unexpected guests is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the author might be expected to communicate their feelings more clearly. They mentioned not being against the sleepover itself, just the lack of notice and choice. But the parents might not realize how important the birthday party is to them. Still, the parents should have checked in with the author before finalizing the arrangements, especially since it's their home and their birthday.\n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, the author's anger is about being excluded from the decision-making process and the surprise. The parents made a decision that impacts the author's event without consulting them. So the parents are partly at fault. The author's reaction is reasonable given their perspective. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
