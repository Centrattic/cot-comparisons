I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party where the author's dad's friend's son is having a sleepover without the author's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author wanted a specific party with their friends, and they were upset because the dad arranged a sleepover with another kid without giving them enough notice. The main issue seems to be about lack of communication and not being consulted in a timely manner. The author mentions hating surprises and not liking last-minute decisions. They also note that they asked to have their friends stay overnight, but the mom said no.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the story, the author is clearly upset about not being informed in time and not having a say in the guest list. They wanted their party to be about their friends, and the unexpected guest is a problem because it's a surprise and they didn't consent. The parents might be overstepping by not consulting their child about their own party arrangements. The fact that the author had to ask if their friends could stay and received a \"no\" adds to the frustration. \n\nThe author isn't against the kid staying per se, but the manner in which it was decided\u2014without their input and at short notice\u2014is the issue. The parents' actions here could be seen as dismissive of the author's preferences and autonomy, especially since it's the author's birthday party. The kid's decision to stay was made by the parents, not the author, so the author's upset is more about the lack of communication and control over their own event. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it doesn't seem so. The parents are making decisions without considering the child's feelings or plans. The author is expressing their right to have their preferences respected. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable or hostile, just frustrated by the lack of communication and the sudden change. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
