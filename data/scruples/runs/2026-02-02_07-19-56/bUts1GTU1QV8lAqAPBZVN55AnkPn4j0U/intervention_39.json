I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a birthday party. The author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, and they found out too late. They wanted to have a party with their friends and are frustrated that the guest list includes someone they didn't invite, especially since they didn't get a choice in the matter.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they wanted to avoid surprises after a past experience where their mom signed them up for a camp trip on their birthday weekend without telling them. That experience probably made them really sensitive about not having surprises. So, when their dad agreed to let the friend's son stay overnight, the author was upset because they weren't consulted in a timely manner. The key points here are the lack of prior communication and the feeling of not having a choice.\n\nThe author isn't against the kid staying per se, but the way it was handled\u2014decided yesterday and told today\u2014is what's bothering them. They also mention that when they asked if their own friends could stay, their mom said no, which adds to the frustration because there's inconsistency in how guests are handled.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is their reaction to the surprise. The author has a valid reason for not liking surprises, given their past experience. However, the dad's friend's son's sleepover was arranged by the parents, so the author's age and the parents' authority might come into play here. If the author is a minor, their parents have the right to make decisions about guests in their home. But if the author is an adult, that dynamic changes.\n\nAssuming the author is a minor, the parents might have the right to decide about guests, even if it's not ideal from the child's perspective. However, the parents could have done a better job of involving the child in the decision, especially since the child's own event is happening. The author's frustration is understandable because their own event is being affected without their input.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is an adult, then they might have more say in who can stay over, especially if it's their own home. But the scenario seems to involve a parent arranging a guest, so the author's ability to refuse might be limited if they're a minor.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The author's feelings are valid because they value being informed and having a say. However, the parents might have a different perspective, prioritizing their friend's child's needs or the social aspect. The key is whether the parents should have communicated better and involved the author in the decision-making process.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, people often consider if the person's actions (or inactions) caused the problem. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of actions taken, but their reaction is based on being upset about a decision made by others. Since the author's main issue is about being informed in time and having a choice, which are reasonable expectations, the answer might lean towards them not being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. They have valid reasons related to past experiences and the lack of communication. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
