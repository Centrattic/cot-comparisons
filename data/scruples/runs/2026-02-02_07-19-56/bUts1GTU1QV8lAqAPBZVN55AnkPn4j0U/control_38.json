I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their birthday party. They wanted to have friends over to play Smash Ultimate. But their dad's friend's son, who's around 10 years old, is coming for a sleepover that they didn't know about until today. The author is upset because they didn't have a say in this and it's a surprise.\n\nFirst, the author's main points are about not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in time. They mention that last year their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them, which makes me think they have a history of feeling left out of decisions that affect them. Now, the parent (either dad or mom) arranged this sleepover without consulting the author. The kid decided to stay over, and the parent just agreed. The author feels it's unfair because they had to ask if their friends could stay and were denied.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it seems like their autonomy is being disregarded. They want control over their own space and social events. The fact that their mom previously did something unexpected makes this situation more frustrating. But the parents might think they're doing something nice, maybe as a favor to the friend, or trying to include the kid. However, not consulting the author here is a problem because it's their house and their party. The author has valid reasons to be upset\u2014lack of communication, not being consulted, and inconsistency in how guest policies are applied (they asked to have their friends stay and it was denied).\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might not realize how their actions affect the author. But the author is old enough to have their own opinions about their social events. So, the parents are at fault here for not respecting the author's wishes. The author isn't being unreasonable for wanting to be informed and to have some control over their party. They're not the one making the decisions; the parents are. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
