I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their birthday party plans. The author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, which they didn't know about until today. They wanted to have a party with their friends and play Smash Ultimate. The key points are that they don't like surprises and wanted to be informed in time.\n\nFirst, the author's parents made arrangements without telling them. The dad invited the friend's son, and the kid decided to stay the night. The parents agreed yesterday and only told the author today. The author feels it's unfair that they weren't given a choice, especially since they asked if their friends could stay and were denied. They\u2019re not against the kid staying but the lack of notice and control over their own event.\n\nNow, considering the age of the author, if they're a teenager or young adult, they might be expected to have some say in their social events. The parents might think they're being helpful by including the friend's son, but not consulting the host could be a problem. The author is upset because their plans are being disrupted without their input. The fact that they had to cancel their own friends' stayovers while allowing another person's shows a lack of consideration for the host's preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, parents might think they're doing what's best, ensuring the guest has a good time. But the main issue here is the lack of communication and respect for the author's wishes. The author isn't against the sleepover itself but the way it was handled. They deserve to be informed in advance and have a say in their own event. So, the parents might be at fault here, not the author. Therefore, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
