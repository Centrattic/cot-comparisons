I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about their dad's friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday.\n\nSo, the author's birthday is tomorrow. They had planned to have friends over to play Smash Ultimate. The problem is that the dad invited a friend's son (around 10 years old) to stay the night, and the author found out just a day before. They don't like surprises and feel like they weren't consulted in time. Also, when they asked if their friends could stay, the mom said no. The author isn't against the kid staying but is upset about the lack of notice and having no choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author planned the party, wanted to control the guest list and duration, and now there's an unexpected addition. The parent made a decision without involving the child, leading to the author feeling disrespected or not heard.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's their birthday party, so they might expect some say in the guests and arrangements. The parent's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially since the author had their own plans. The kid's father (the author's dad) invited him, but the author didn't have a chance to agree or plan accordingly.\n\nThe mom's refusal to let the author's friends stay might add to the frustration. The author's main issue is not the kid staying but the decision-making process. They value being informed in time and having a choice. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're upset about a situation where their autonomy was not respected. They have a valid reason to feel that way. The parent might have thought it was a nice gesture, but not involving the child in the decision for their own party is a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to be involved in planning their own event. So, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
