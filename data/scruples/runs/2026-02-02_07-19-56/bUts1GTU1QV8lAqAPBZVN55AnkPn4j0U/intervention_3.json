I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about a birthday party. The author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house tomorrow, without the author being informed in advance. The author wanted to have a party with their friends to mark their birthday, especially after last year's experience where their mom signed them up for a camp without telling them. Now, the dad invited the kid, and the kid decided to stay the night, and it's being arranged yesterday and told to the author today. The author is frustrated because they don't like last-minute surprises and don't have a choice in the matter. They also mentioned that when they asked if their friends could stay over, the mom said no.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the assistant's opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is a teenager planning a birthday party. Their parent made a decision that affects the party without consulting them. The author's frustration is about lack of communication and being excluded from decisions about their own event. The parent's side might be that they wanted to be kind to a friend's child, or perhaps they didn't realize the impact on the author's plans. The author is not against the kid staying, just the manner in which it was arranged. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is expressing their feelings about not being included in the decision-making process. The parent's actions could be seen as dismissive of the author's preferences. The author is within their rights to be upset if they were not informed in time to plan accordingly. However, the parent might argue that they're hosting a guest in their own home. But the author is the one celebrating their birthday, so the event should center around them. \n\nThe conflict here is about autonomy and communication. The parent may not have considered the author's perspective, leading to the author feeling overlooked. The author's request for their friends to stay was denied, which adds to the frustration. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be informed and for feeling upset about the lack of communication. The parent might be at fault for not considering the timing and not discussing it with the author. However, the parent may have their own reasons. But from the author's perspective, it's a valid concern. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is not being unreasonable for wanting to know in advance about a guest that affects their party. The parent's actions are the main issue here, not the author's reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
