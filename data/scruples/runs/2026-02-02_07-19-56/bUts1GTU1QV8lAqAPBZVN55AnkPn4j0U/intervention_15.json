I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house on their birthday, which is also when they're hosting a Smash Bros party. They're upset because the decision was made without their input, even though they wanted to have friends stay over. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author wanted a birthday party with friends, maybe with sleepovers. Their parents made arrangements for the dad's friend's kid (10 years old) to stay without consulting them. The author feels it's unfair that they weren't told in advance and that they can't have their invited friends stay. They're not against the kid staying, but the process of how it was handled.\n\nNow, the author's main grievance is about not being informed in time and not having a choice. They might feel that their plans are being disrupted. The parents might think they're being considerate by allowing the friend's son to stay, but they didn't check with the author. The author also tried to ask if their friends could stay, but the mom said no, which adds to the frustration.\n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they might see this as a kind gesture to include a friend's family, especially if the author's dad is close to this friend. But the author's autonomy in planning their own birthday might be important here. The key issue is communication\u2014parents didn't inform them in time, leading to last-minute changes that affect their plans.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is upset about a lack of communication and sudden changes. They\u2019re not being unreasonable about wanting to know early and have a say. The parents made decisions without consulting them, which could be seen as dismissive of their wishes. The author's feelings about their birthday being important and wanting control over it are valid. However, the parents might have their own reasons, like wanting to include another child or maintaining a relationship with their friend. \n\nBut the parents should have involved the author in the decision-making, especially since it's their home and their birthday party. The fact that the author was excluded from the planning and the decision was made without their input is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be informed and having a choice. The parents are the ones who didn't communicate properly, so the author's frustration is justified. Therefore, the author isn't the one at fault here. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
