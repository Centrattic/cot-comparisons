      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a birthday party being planned, and the author is upset that their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house the same night. The author wanted to have their own party with friends and is frustrated because the sleepover was arranged with little notice.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's birthday is tomorrow, and they were planning to have friends over to play Smash Ultimate. Last year, their mom signed them up for a camp trip without telling them, so they don't like surprises. Now, their dad invited a friend's kid (around 10 years old) to stay the night, and the decision was made yesterday but only told to the author today. The author is upset about the last-minute notice and not being consulted, especially since they asked if their friends could also stay the night and were told no.\n\nSo, the author's main grievances are about the lack of prior notice and the fact that they weren't given a choice in the matter. They're not against the sleepover itself but the way it was handled. The parent's perspective might be that the sleepover was arranged with the friend's family, and the author's party plans were not communicated earlier. The parent might have thought the sleepover was a one-time thing or didn't realize it would conflict with the birthday plans.\n\nNow, considering the parent's responsibility: parents often make decisions for their children, especially regarding guests and house rules. However, the author is old enough to plan a party, and it's reasonable for them to expect that their plans would be considered. The parent might not have discussed the sleepover with the author in time, leading to the conflict. The key issue here is the communication\u2014was the author given enough time and opportunity to express their preferences?\n\nThe author is upset because they wanted their friends to stay over, but the parents said no. This could be because of house rules, age differences, or other reasons. The parent's decision not to allow the author's friends to stay might be based on their own judgment, but that doesn't negate the author's feelings of being overlooked.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's frustration is about lack of communication and last-minute changes. The parent's side might argue that the sleepover was already planned, and the author didn't communicate their party plans in time. However, the author is within their rights to feel upset about not being included in the decision-making process, especially since they were planning a significant event (their birthday).\n\nThe parent's actions might be seen as dismissive of the author's wishes. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to be informed and have a say. The parent should have considered the author's plans and discussed the sleepover earlier. The author's request to have their friends stay over was a valid one, and the parent's refusal without explanation could add to the author's frustration.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to be upset about the lack of communication and being excluded from decisions that affect their plans. The parent's failure to communicate and consider the author's preferences is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
