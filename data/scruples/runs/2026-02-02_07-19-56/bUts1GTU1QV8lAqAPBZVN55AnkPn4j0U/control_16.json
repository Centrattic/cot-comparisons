I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about a sleepover at their house. The author is having a birthday party and invited friends. Their dad's friend's son wants to have a sleepover, and the parents allowed it without informing the author. The author is upset because they don't like surprises and wanted to be told in advance. They also mention not having a choice and that their friends couldn't stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were planning their birthday party, which was important to them, especially after a past disappointment. Being informed last-minute about an unexpected guest might make them feel disrespected or not considered. They might feel that their preferences (like not wanting surprises) were ignored. Also, the fact that their own friends weren't allowed to stay could add to the frustration, making the situation seem unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have thought it was a good idea to include the dad's friend's son, maybe to support the author's socializing. However, not informing the author in advance and not considering their feelings about having control over their own event is a key point. The author isn't against the guest staying but is upset about the lack of communication and autonomy.\n\nThe core issue is about consent and communication. The author had a right to know about the sleepover in a timely manner to make their own plans. The parents should have discussed it with the author first, respecting their wishes. The author's reaction is about wanting to be included in decisions that affect their event, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have valid reasons to be upset about the lack of communication and being excluded from decisions regarding their own party. The parents are at fault here for not considering the author's preferences and not giving them a say.\n"
