I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their birthday party. They wanted to have a Smash Ultimate party with friends. The parents mentioned that the dad's friend's son, who's around 10, is coming over for a sleepover. The author is upset because they weren't told in advance, and they feel like they don't have a choice. They also mention that they asked if their friends could stay overnight, but the mom said no.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be about not being informed in advance. The parents decided on the sleepover yesterday and told the author today, which is right before the party. The author doesn't like surprises and feels that they should have been told earlier. The 10-year-old kid just decided he wanted to stay, and the dad agreed without consulting the author, who is presumably a teenager since they're inviting friends for a party.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a right to feel upset if they wanted to plan their party and didn't get a say. Having an unexpected guest could disrupt the party's vibe. On the other hand, the parents might be trying to be kind by including a friend's child, especially if they had prior arrangements. Also, the author's mom didn't allow their friends to stay, which might add to the frustration since they can't invite their friends overnight but a stranger can.\n\nThe author isn't against the kid staying, just the manner in which it was arranged. So it's more about the lack of communication and autonomy. However, the parents might not have considered the author's feelings when making the decision. But maybe the parents thought it was a nice gesture, and the author is within their rights to be upset. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents should have discussed this with the author before finalizing the plans. The author's request for their friends to stay was denied, which highlights inconsistency in the parents' decisions. The author's frustration is valid because they wanted to have control over their own party. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are expressing their feelings about not being consulted and not liking last-minute changes. They aren't being unreasonable. The parents might be at fault for not involving the author. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
