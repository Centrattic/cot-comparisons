I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is upset because their dad's friend's son is having a sleepover at their house on the same night as their birthday party. The author wanted to have friends over for a Smash Bros game, and they're frustrated because the arrangement was made without their input, even though they don't mind the kid staying per se, just the way it was handled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's birthday is the next day, and they wanted to celebrate with friends. Their dad invited the kid, and the kid decided to stay over without the author's knowledge. The author is upset about the lack of notice and not being consulted. They also mention that when they asked if their friends could stay, the mom said no. \n\nNow, thinking about typical AITA scenarios, people often get upset when their personal plans are affected without their consent, especially if they're a teenager or young adult. The author is trying to have a birthday party, which is a significant event for them. The parents made arrangements without considering the author's plans, which could be seen as dismissive of their needs. \n\nThe author isn't against the kid staying per se, but the lack of communication and the sudden change in plans is the main issue. They mentioned not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in a timely manner. The parents might have thought they were being kind by inviting the kid, but they didn't consider the impact on the author's birthday plans. \n\nOn the other hand, the kid's parents might have thought it was a good idea for their son to have a sleepover, but maybe they should have checked with the author's parents earlier. However, the author's parents did agree without consulting the author, which is a problem. \n\nThe author's frustration is about being excluded from the decision-making process, especially for a day that's important to them. The fact that the parents didn't even consider the author's perspective (like allowing their friends to stay) adds to the issue. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the line between being reasonable and being an asshole can be thin. If the parents had considered the author's plans and communicated better, maybe the author would be at fault for being upset. But since the parents made the decision without consulting the author, especially for a significant event like a birthday, the parents might be at fault. However, the author is also an adult (assuming they're 18+ since they're on a platform like Reddit) and might need to take some responsibility for not communicating their plans earlier. But given that the parents made the decision without any prior discussion, the author's upset is understandable. \n\nSo, based on the analysis, the author isn't in the wrong because the parents didn't consider their child's plans and made the decision without consultation. The author's frustration is valid in this context.\n"
