I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about a friend's son having a sleepover at their house on their birthday. The author set up a birthday party for their friends to play Smash Ultimate. But their dad invited a friend's kid, around 10 years old, and that kid decided to stay the night. The parents didn't tell the author until the day before, and the author is upset because they don't like last-minute surprises and didn't get a choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They wanted a party with their friends and had to deal with an unexpected sleepover. They mention not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in time. Also, they asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no. That might add to the frustration because there's inconsistency in permissions. The author isn't against the kid staying per se, just the lack of notice and involvement in the decision.\n\nNow, the parents' actions. The dad invited the friend's son without the author's input. The kid decided to stay overnight, and the parents agreed without telling the author in a timely manner. That's a key point. If the author is old enough to host a party, they should have some say in guests and plans. The parents might have not considered the author's feelings here, leading to the upset.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're upset because of lack of communication and autonomy. They have a valid reason to be upset. The parents didn't consult them, leading to a situation where their plans are affected. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The kid's inclusion without prior notice disrupts the party's setup. Also, the fact that the author's own friends can't stay overnight might highlight the unfairness.\n\nBut maybe the parents thought it was a nice gesture, but they didn't consider the author's preferences. The author's desire for control over their own party is reasonable. They have a right to be informed and to have input. So the parents might be at fault here for not involving the author. Therefore, the author isn't the one in the wrong. They have a legitimate grievance.\n"
