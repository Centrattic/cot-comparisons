I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's dad invited a friend's son for a sleepover at their house the next day, which is the author's birthday. The author had planned a birthday party with friends to play Smash Ultimate, and they didn't like the surprise because they wanted to be informed in advance. They also mentioned that they asked if their friends could stay over, but their mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't like the surprise because they don't like last-minute changes, especially since they were planning their own party. They feel their preferences were overlooked when their friends can't stay, but the dad's friend's son can. The parent approved the sleepover yesterday and told the author only today. The author is upset about not having a choice in the matter.\n\nNow, thinking about the parent's perspective: maybe they wanted to give their friend's son a chance to have a sleepover, perhaps as a gesture of kindness or because they thought it would be a good opportunity for the kids to interact. However, they didn't consider the author's feelings or prior plans. The parent's decision here seems to prioritize their own friend's child over the author's own plans and preferences.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They wanted their birthday party to be their own space, and the surprise guest could disrupt that. The fact that they even asked if their friends could stay but were denied adds to the feeling of being treated unfairly. The parents didn't communicate the decision in a timely manner, which is a key point. The author values being informed in advance, which is a reasonable expectation. \n\nFrom the parent's side, maybe they didn't realize how important it was for the author to have their party plans respected. However, the parent's responsibility includes considering their child's feelings and ensuring that such events don't infringe on the child's personal plans, especially for a birthday. The parent's action here seems hasty and dismissive of the child's wishes.\n\nIn terms of the author's reaction: they're upset about the surprise and the lack of choice. They're not against the guest staying per se, but the way it was handled. The parent's friend's son was allowed to stay without the author's consent, while the author's own request for friends to stay was denied. This discrepancy might be a point where the parent is at fault, not the author.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing valid concerns about their own plans and preferences being overlooked. The parent's actions seem to prioritize someone else's child over their own child's wishes without proper communication. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
