I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset about a sleepover at their house during their birthday. The situation is that the author wanted a Smash Ultimate party and was planning to invite some friends. However, their dad's friend's son, who's 10, just decided to have a sleepover without the author being consulted until right before the party. The author doesn't like surprises and feels they have no choice in the matter. The parents agreed to it yesterday and told the author today, which is the same day as the party. The author is upset because they weren't given a choice and the timing is last minute. They also asked if their friends could stay, but the mom said no.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is the a**hole here. The key points are: the author's right to have their birthday plans include their own preferences, the parents' decision-making process, and the lack of prior communication. The author is 10 years old, so their autonomy in planning their own party might be limited by parental decisions. But the problem is the surprise and the last-minute notice. The author had to plan their party, and a sleepover by someone else might interfere with that. Also, the parents gave permission for the friend's son to stay but not the author's friends, which could add to the frustration.\n\nNow, considering the author's age and the fact that they were planning their own party, the parents' actions might be seen as not respecting the author's wishes. The author is upset because they were not included in the decision, which is a valid concern. The parents might have thought it was a good idea to let the other child stay, but not informing the author in time to adjust their plans could be the issue. The author's friends were not allowed to stay, which might make the situation feel even more unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are responsible for making decisions regarding the house and guest policies. The author's dad is hosting a friend's son, so maybe they have a relationship and wanted to accommodate. But the timing and lack of consultation are problematic. The author expressing their feelings is reasonable, especially if they value their own plans. The fact that the author is not against the sleepover itself but the manner in which it was arranged suggests they're more upset about the lack of control and communication.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to be upset about not being prepared and not having a say. The parents might be the ones who should have considered the author's preferences and given more notice. The answer would be B (No).\n"
