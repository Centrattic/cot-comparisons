I really wanted this party to happen since last year my mom randomly signed me up for a weekend camp trip last year during my birthday weekend without telling me (I can post that story in the comments if someone wants to hear it). She just told me my dad invited one of his friends kids who\u2019s around 10 years old.The kid decided he wanted to do stay the night and my dad said yes. So I don\u2019t like surprises and I just want to be told things in time and not right before. They agreed on this yesterday and are just telling me today. Honestly I\u2019m not against him staying the night I just don\u2019t like how he just decided he wanted to and just is coming and that I don\u2019t have a choice. I even asked if the friends I invited could stay the night too, and my mom said no.  \n\nAm I the a hole??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a birthday party. The author wanted to have a Smash Ultimate party with friends. Their dad's friend's son is coming for a sleepover, but there were no prior discussions about it. The author feels upset because they didn't get to choose, even though they're okay with the kid staying. They wanted their friends to stay too, but the mom said no.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings about not liking surprises and wanting to be informed in time. That makes sense. People often appreciate being part of the planning, especially for their own events. The fact that the parents made the decision without consulting the author is a key point here. Even if the author is okay with the guest, the lack of communication and inclusion in the decision is an issue.\n\nThen there's the inconsistency. The author's friends weren't allowed to stay, but the dad's friend's son was. That could feel unfair. The author is justified in feeling that they should have the same treatment for their friends. The parents didn't check in with the author about the plans, which is a problem because it's the author's birthday party, so they should have more say in the details.\n\nThe mom's previous action of signing up the author for a camp without telling them adds context. It shows a pattern where the parents make decisions without the author's input, which might contribute to their current frustration. The author isn't against the guest but is upset about the lack of choice in the matter.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't at fault for being upset. They have valid reasons: lack of communication, unfair treatment compared to their friends, and a history of the parents making decisions without them. The parents should have involved the author in planning the party, especially since it's their birthday. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
