      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop sometimes because some of it makes them vomit. The situation is that the author usually cleans up, but occasionally there's a poop that's so bad it makes them throw up when picking it up. They feel that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving the dog poop, and some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the responsibility of dog owners. Generally, picking up after your dog is a common courtesy and a legal requirement in many places. The author says they do this 99% of the time, which is good, but 1% they struggle with. The issue here is whether it's acceptable to leave the poop uncollected in those rare cases.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the act of picking up those particularly vile poops causes them to vomit, so they leave it, and they argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse. However, the park is a public space, and leaving either dog poop or vomit is unhygienic and not acceptable. But the key difference is that the dog poop is the dog's natural waste, whereas the vomit is a result of the owner's action (not picking up). The owner has a responsibility to manage their pet's waste regardless of personal discomfort.\n\nEven if it's difficult, the solution might be to handle it properly. For example, using gloves, taking extra precautions, or using a plastic bag to contain the waste and dispose of it in a bin. Leaving the poop in the park is still irresponsible, even if the owner is upset about it. The fact that some people got mad at them suggests that the community expects them to clean up regardless of the circumstances.\n\nSo, while the author's experience is understandable, the responsibility to clean up remains. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not picking up the poop even in those rare cases.\n"
