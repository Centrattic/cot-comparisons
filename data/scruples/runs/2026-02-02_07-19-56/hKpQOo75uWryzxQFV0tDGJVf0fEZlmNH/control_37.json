      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether they should have picked up their dog's poop every time, even when it made them throw up.\n\nFirst, the user says that 99% of the time they do pick up the poop and put it in the bin. That's a high compliance rate, which is good. The problem is that once in a while, the poop is so bad that it causes them to vomit when they pick it up. They've actually thrown up before while doing this. Their reasoning is that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop.\n\nSome people got mad at them for not picking up that one instance. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Legally, in many places, you are required to clean up after your dog. So not picking up at all could be an issue. But here, the person is almost always doing it. The exception is when it causes them physical distress. So maybe there's a health or safety argument here? If picking it up causes them to vomit, maybe they can't be expected to do it every single time. But then again, maybe they should use gloves or something to prevent that?\n\nOn the other hand, from the perspective of others, if someone sees a dog's poop in the park, they might not know the reason. They could be upset because they're allergic, or they just don't want to deal with it. The user's argument is that leaving vomit is worse, but maybe they didn't actually leave vomit; they just threw up after picking it up. So perhaps they still left the poop there, which is the main issue.\n\nAlso, maybe there's a solution. Like using a plastic bag to pick it up and then throwing it away somewhere else. Or maybe they could ask someone else to help in those rare cases. But the user is saying they can't do it because it makes them vomit. So maybe there's a valid reason here, but at the same time, the responsibility of pet ownership includes cleaning up.\n\nIn terms of community standards, people generally expect that you clean up after your pets. Even if it's unpleasant, that's part of the commitment. So while the user is mostly compliant, that one instance where they didn't might still make them responsible. However, if they have a medical reason or extreme reaction, maybe that's a mitigating factor.\n\nBut the key point is that they left the poop in the park. Even if it made them sick, they could have taken precautions. Maybe using gloves or a different method. Alternatively, if they can't handle it physically, maybe they shouldn't have a dog. But that's harsh. Alternatively, maybe they should have asked someone else to help in that one case.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards AITA being the author because they failed to clean up once, even though it's a rare occurrence. But the fact that they usually do it is a mitigating factor. However, the people who got mad were reacting to the presence of the poop, not knowing the reason. The user's justification is that vomiting is worse, but that's their own experience. The public's concern is about the dog poop. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not cleaning up that one time, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
