      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop. The situation is that normally they do clean up, but once in a while, the dog's poop is so bad it makes them vomit. They've actually vomited while picking it up before. They think leaving vomit in the park is worse than dog poop, and some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basic responsibility of dog owners. Generally, it's expected that you clean up after your dog to maintain public hygiene and respect for others. Not doing so can lead to complaints or being seen as irresponsible. The author claims they usually do clean up, but there's an exception when the poop is \"vile\" and causes them to vomit. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse than the poop, so they avoid cleaning up in those rare cases.\n\nBut wait, the main issue here is whether not cleaning up even once is in the wrong. Even if it's a rare occurrence, the fact that they didn't clean up at all in those instances might be problematic. People who get angry could be upset because any instance of not cleaning up is a violation of the expected norm. Even if it's 1% of the time, that's still a failure to meet the standard. Also, the argument that vomit is worse is a bit of a stretch. While vomit might be more unpleasant, the responsibility of the dog owner isn't just about comparing which is worse but about fulfilling their duty. The presence of dog poop in public spaces is a common issue, and leaving it there can pose health risks or be unsanitary. \n\nMoreover, the author's solution of leaving the poop because they might vomit could be seen as using a personal aversion as an excuse. A responsible pet owner might need to find a way to handle the situation, like wearing gloves, using a different type of bag, or even asking someone else to assist in those rare cases. The fact that they've vomited before suggests that the issue isn't just about the poop's appearance but a physical reaction, but even so, there's an expected standard of care. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance their personal discomfort with public responsibility. They're acknowledging the problem and trying to justify their actions by comparing it to another unpleasant situation. However, public expectations might not be swayed by such reasoning. People who encounter the poop might not be aware of the author's personal struggle and could still be upset. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions, even if rare, do violate the general expectation of cleaning up after their dog. The justification provided might not be sufficient in the eyes of others, especially those who value cleanliness and responsibility. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for those instances where they didn't clean up, despite their reasoning.\n"
