      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop sometimes. The situation is that the author usually does pick it up, but there are rare instances where the dog's poop is so bad it makes them vomit. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse, so they don't pick it up in those cases.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and responsibilities of dog ownership. Generally, dog owners are expected to clean up after their pets in public places. This is both a matter of public health and etiquette. So, even if there's a rare exception, the norm is that you should always clean up.\n\nThe author mentions that 99% of the time they do pick it up. The issue is the 1% where they can't handle it. But the problem here is that even if it's 1%, not cleaning up that 1% means they're not fully fulfilling their responsibility. Others might find the situation unpleasant regardless of the author's reaction. Also, the argument about vomit being worse is a bit of a red herring. The park is a public space, and the author's vomit is a consequence of their own action (not cleaning up the poop), so it's not a valid justification.\n\nThen there's the part where people got mad at them. That suggests that others don't see the exception as a valid reason. The author is trying to justify their behavior, but the responsibility is still on them to clean up regardless of how bad the poop is. The emotional response (vomiting) doesn't negate the obligation.\n\nSo, even though the author is making an effort most of the time, the fact that they sometimes don't clean up because of their reaction is where they go wrong. The correct action would be to find a way to handle it, like using gloves or getting help, rather than leaving it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for those instances.\n"
