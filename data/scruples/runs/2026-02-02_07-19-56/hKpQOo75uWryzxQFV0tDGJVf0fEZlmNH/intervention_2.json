      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop every time. They mention that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but once in a while, the poop is so bad it makes them throw up. They feel that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop, and some people were upset with them for not picking it up.\n\nFirst, the main issue is responsibility as a dog owner. Generally, picking up after your dog is a societal norm and often a legal requirement in many places. The fact that they do it 99% of the time shows they're mostly responsible. However, that one time they didn't clean up could still be a problem. Even if the poop made them sick, there are solutions like using gloves, maybe even hiring someone else to handle the mess, or using a different method to clean it up without direct contact. \n\nThe argument they make is that leaving vomit is worse than poop. But I think the public expects that even if it's unpleasant, you should still clean up. Vomit is indeed unpleasant, but the responsibility of a pet owner includes managing such situations. People might not be as understanding about vomit in the park as they are about dog poop. Also, the person's reaction of throwing up might be a personal issue that they need to address, perhaps with some preparation or professional help. \n\nSo, while the person is mostly responsible and does a good job most of the time, that one incident where they didn't clean up because they threw up could be seen as neglecting their duty. Others might not realize the personal struggle, and the fact that they had an alternative reason (vomit) doesn't negate their responsibility to clean up the poop. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
