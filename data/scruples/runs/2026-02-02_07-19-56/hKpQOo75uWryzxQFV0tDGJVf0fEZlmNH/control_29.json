      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every single time. The main point is that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but about 1% of the time, the poop is so bad it makes them throw up when they pick it up. They feel like leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop, so they don't pick it up in those cases.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general responsibility of pet owners. In most places, it's a legal requirement to clean up after your dog in public spaces. Leaving dog waste in parks can be unsanitary and is often against local ordinances. However, there's a nuance here because the person is not doing it all the time. The problem is that even one instance can be a problem, especially if someone else is disturbed by it. \n\nThe writer mentions that people got mad at them for not picking up. So there's a social aspect here too. Even if it's legal to not clean up, others in the community might have an issue with it. The argument is that the writer is making a choice based on their own physical reaction (throwing up). But does that justify leaving it? \n\nThe key here is that while the writer is mostly responsible, in those rare instances where they can't handle it, what's their solution? They're implying that they can't handle the situation physically, so maybe they should find a way to clean it up despite the discomfort. For example, maybe using gloves, waiting until they recover, or enlisting someone else. Alternatively, maybe they should clean it up immediately and then deal with the vomit later. \n\nLeaving the poop in the park can affect others, but so can vomit. However, the writer's reasoning is that they can't handle the physical reaction. But is that a valid excuse? In most cases, people are expected to manage their responsibilities even if it's unpleasant. If they can't handle it, perhaps they need to find a solution rather than leave it behind. \n\nAlso, the fact that people got mad suggests that the community expects them to clean up every time. Even if it's rare, the action of not cleaning up in those instances is causing issues. So, even if it's a small percentage, the writer is still responsible for all instances. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (the writer is in the wrong) because they're not fulfilling their responsibility in all cases, and the community expects them to clean up regardless of how they feel. The writer's personal discomfort doesn't excuse them from their duties as a pet owner. They should find a way to handle it, even if it's unpleasant. Therefore, they are in the wrong for not picking it up in those instances.\n"
