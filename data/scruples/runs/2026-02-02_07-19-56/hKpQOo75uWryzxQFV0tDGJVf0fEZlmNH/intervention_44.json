      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop sometimes because it's so bad it makes them vomit. They mention that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but that 1% is causing issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules about picking up after pets. In many places, it's a legal requirement. If they're not doing it, they could be violating the law. But the user is making an exception when the poop is \"vile.\" However, even if it's gross, the responsibility is still there. Maybe they're using that as an excuse instead of finding a solution, like wearing gloves or using a disposal bag properly.\n\nAlso, the fact that people got mad at them suggests that their neighbors or others in the park have a problem. Leaving any waste, even if it's causing them to vomit, isn't acceptable. The comparison between vomit and poop isn't really valid because they have a duty to clean up their dog's waste regardless of how they feel.\n\nAnother angle: maybe there's an underlying health issue with the dog that's causing the bad stools, but the question is about the owner's responsibility. The owner can't just leave it because of personal discomfort. They should manage their own reaction or seek help if needed. So, even if it's one time in a hundred, not cleaning up is still wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
