      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every single time. Let's start by breaking down the situation they described.\n\nThe user says that 99% of the time, their dog's poop is disposed of properly in the bin. But there's that 1% where the poop is so vile that they throw up when picking it up. They've actually done that before\u2014thrown up while picking it up. Their reasoning is that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop, which is why they sometimes don't clean up. Some people got mad at them for this, and now they're asking if they're the a**hole (AITA).\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal and moral obligations. In most places, there are laws requiring pet owners to clean up after their dogs in public areas. So not picking up at all would be against the law, but the user is saying they do it 99% of the time. The issue is that 1% where they don't clean up because of the extreme reaction they have.\n\nThe key here is whether their exception is a valid justification. The user is experiencing a physical reaction (vomiting) when handling certain stools. That's a strong physiological response, possibly even a medical issue. If they're actually getting physically ill to the point of vomiting, that's a significant health issue. But does that excuse them from the remaining 1%?\n\nFrom a public health and safety standpoint, leaving dog poop in the park can spread disease and parasites. It's a known hazard. However, leaving vomit from someone who was trying to clean up might be a different kind of hazard, but the user argues that the vomit is worse. But is that a valid comparison? Vomit can also carry pathogens, but perhaps in different ways. However, the user is implying that because they are physically unable to handle the stool without vomiting, they can't fulfill that 1% responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, even if they experience vomiting, the fact that they are able to do it 99% of the time suggests that they are generally responsible. The 1% could be a rare but necessary exception. But others might argue that there's no excuse for not cleaning up at all times, regardless of the difficulty. \n\nThere's also the social aspect. Some people in the park got mad, which indicates that the community expects 100% compliance. Even if the user is mostly compliant, that 1% infraction is still a problem for others. The question is whether the user's health issue is a legitimate reason to not clean up that 1% of the time.\n\nIn some cases, people with allergies or medical conditions might have accommodations for certain tasks, but this is a public space. The user might need to find a solution, like using gloves more thoroughly, maybe using a tool to handle the stool without direct contact, or even asking someone else to help. However, the user's response is to leave the stool because of the vomiting reaction. \n\nAnother angle is whether the user has a mental or physical health issue that could be addressed. If the user is genuinely experiencing such a severe reaction that it's causing vomiting, maybe they should see a doctor to address the underlying cause. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong now, not about future solutions.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, legally they might be in violation if they don't clean up that 1% of the time, depending on local laws. Morally, it's more complex. The user is mostly responsible, but the 1% might be seen as an exception that's not acceptable. On the other hand, their health is a factor. However, the community's expectation is that all poop is cleaned up, and even a small percentage can lead to negative reactions from others.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between the user's health and the community's expectations. While the user's situation is understandable, the fact that they're making an exception even once can be seen as irresponsible. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the user being in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's a better angle.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is not in the wrong because they are mostly compliant and have a valid reason for the rare exceptions. If the vomiting is a genuine medical issue, then others might be more empathetic. However, the problem is that they are still leaving dog waste in public, which is a known issue. So, maybe the answer is a mix. But according to the question, I have to choose between A or B.\n\nConsidering that the user is not 100% compliant and that there are strict laws and social norms about cleaning up after pets, the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong). However, if the exception is due to a valid health issue, maybe B. But the user hasn't provided medical evidence, just their own account. So, in the absence of that, the community might not accept it as a valid excuse. Therefore, A.\n"
