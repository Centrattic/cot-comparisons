      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop every time. They say that 99% of the time they do, but once in a hundred times, the poop is so bad that they throw up and can't pick it up. They left it in the park, and some people got mad. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main point here is about responsibility as a dog owner. Generally, I think it's a given that you should clean up after your dog. It's not just about being a good neighbor but also about public health and hygiene. Leaving dog poop in the park can be a health hazard and is often against local laws. So, even once isn't acceptable, right? The author's defense is that the one time was an exception because of their reaction. But even if it makes them sick, maybe there's a way to handle it differently. Like using gloves, maybe taking someone else to do it, or using a disposal bag and then taking it out later. Also, leaving vomit in the park isn't a good excuse because the original problem was the dog's waste. The author's action of not cleaning up once could still be considered wrong regardless of their physical reaction. People might not understand the exception and could be upset, especially since there's a legal obligation there. So, even though there's a rare case, the responsibility still lies with them to find a solution. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
