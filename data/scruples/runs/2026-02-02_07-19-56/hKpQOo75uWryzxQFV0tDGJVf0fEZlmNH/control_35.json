      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every time. The situation is that 99% of the time, they do pick it up and put it in the bin. But once in a hundred times, the poop is so bad that they throw up when trying to pick it up, and they've actually vomited in the park once. Other people got mad at them for not cleaning up in those rare cases.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and responsibilities around pet ownership. In most places, it's a legal requirement to clean up after your dog in public spaces. So by law, the person is supposed to pick up all their dog's waste. The fact that they do it 99% of the time is good, but the issue is the remaining 1% where they don't.\n\nNow, the argument the author is making is that in those rare cases, the physical reaction of vomiting makes it impossible for them to clean up, and they think leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop. But that's their reasoning. However, the problem is that even if they vomit, they're still responsible for cleaning up the poop. Leaving dog waste in the park can be unsanitary and a health hazard, which is why there are laws against it. Vomiting might be unpleasant, but it's a different scenario. The key point is that the law doesn't have exceptions based on personal physical reactions. So even if someone throws up, they still need to manage the situation, maybe by using gloves or other methods to handle the waste properly.\n\nAlso, the fact that others got mad suggests that the community expects them to clean up every time. So the author might be in the wrong because they're not fulfilling their responsibility in those rare instances. They could argue that it's an unavoidable medical issue, but unless they have a medical condition that prevents them from handling the waste (which they haven't mentioned), they might still be held responsible. The solution would be to find a way to handle the situation, like using disposable gloves, carrying extra bags, or even asking someone else to help in those rare cases. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are not cleaning up in all cases, which is a legal and community expectation, even if it's a small percentage of the time.\n"
