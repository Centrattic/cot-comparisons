      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop. The scenario is that 99% of the time they do pick it up, but 1% are so bad they make them vomit, and they've actually done that before. They left the poop in the park once and got yelled at, so they're wondering if they're the antagonist in the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic etiquette regarding dog waste. In most places, it's a legal requirement and a general social norm to clean up after your dog. Leaving dog poop in public areas is considered irresponsible and can be harmful to the environment and public health. Even if the person has a valid reason for not picking up once, the fact that they did so in a public park where others might be affected is a problem.\n\nThe user argues that leaving vomit would be worse, but that's not the scenario. The issue here is that the person didn't clean up the poop at all. Even if the poop was causing them to vomit, there are solutions like using gloves, a poop bag, or even asking someone else for help. The key point is that the responsibility to clean up doesn't disappear just because the task is unpleasant or causes a physical reaction.\n\nAlso, the fact that the person got mad at them implies that others in the community expect them to follow the rules. The occasional exception doesn't justify the behavior, especially when it's a small percentage of the time. The argument that leaving poop is better than leaving vomit is somewhat irrelevant because the proper action is to clean up regardless of the difficulty. The person could have taken the poop home and disposed of it there, even if it made them sick. The primary responsibility is to their community and public hygiene.\n\nSo, while the person's reaction is understandable, the act of not cleaning up even once is against the norm, making them responsible. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
