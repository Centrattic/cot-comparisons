      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is at fault for not picking up their dog's poop. The situation is that 99% of the time they do pick it up, but once in a hundred times, the poop is so bad that they throw up. They left it in the park, and some people got mad.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is responsibility. In most places, pet owners are legally required to clean up after their pets. So even if it's a rare case, not cleaning up at all could be considered wrong. The person argues that leaving vomit (from throwing up) is worse than poop, but the problem is they didn't clean up the poop in the first place. \n\nEven if they got sick, maybe they could have taken precautions, like wearing gloves or using a disposal bag. Alternatively, maybe they could have tried to clean up despite the discomfort. Leaving it in the park might be against the rules, regardless of the reason. The fact that people got mad suggests that others expect them to follow the norm. So, even though the situation is a bit extreme, the person still didn't fulfill their responsibility. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. But maybe the answer depends on the specific circumstances of the park's rules and local laws. But generally, I think they are in the wrong because the responsibility is on the owner to clean up, no matter how unpleasant it is.\n"
