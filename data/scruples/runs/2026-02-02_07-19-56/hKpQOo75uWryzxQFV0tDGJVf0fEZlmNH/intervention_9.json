      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not cleaning up their dog's poop every time, specifically when the poop is so bad that it makes them vomit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general rules about dog waste. Most places have laws requiring pet owners to clean up after their pets. Leaving dog poop in public areas is usually considered unsanitary and against local ordinances. The poster says they do it 99% of the time, which is good, but the issue is the 1% where they can't handle it because of the vomit reaction.\n\nThe person is concerned that leaving vomit in the park is worse than dog poop. But the main point here is whether they're violating the law or being irresponsible. Even if they have a physical reaction, the responsibility to clean up still applies. They can't use their personal reaction as an excuse to break the rules. Maybe they should have a backup plan, like carrying an extra bag or a disinfectant wipe in case they vomit, so they can still clean up properly. \n\nAlso, others got mad at them, which suggests that people in the park expect all poop to be cleaned. Leaving even one instance isn't acceptable. The argument that leaving vomit is worse doesn't change the fact that they failed to clean up the poop. The vomit is a consequence of their inability to handle it, but that doesn't excuse the failure to dispose of the waste. \n\nSo, even if it's a rare occurrence, the fact remains that they didn't follow the rule every time. They should handle it regardless of their reaction. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't clean up once, which is against the norms and laws.\n"
