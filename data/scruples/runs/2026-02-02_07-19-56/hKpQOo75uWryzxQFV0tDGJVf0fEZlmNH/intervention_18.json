      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop sometimes. The situation is that the author usually cleans up, but occasionally, the dog's poop is so vile that they throw up when trying to pick it up. They feel that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving the poop, so they don't pick it up in those cases. Some people got mad at them for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general rules about cleaning up after dogs. In most public places, it's expected and often legally required to clean up after your pet. Leaving dog waste is unsanitary and can be a health hazard. So the author is mostly following the rules 99% of the time, which is good. But there's that 1% where they can't handle it. The key here is whether the exception is reasonable.\n\nThe author argues that in those rare instances, leaving the poop is less bad than leaving their vomit. However, the problem is that even one instance of not cleaning up could be seen as irresponsible. Even if the dog's poop is particularly bad, the responsibility still falls on the owner to dispose of it properly. Maybe they could use gloves, or maybe there's a way to handle it without getting sick. Alternatively, they could ask someone else to help in those rare cases. But by not cleaning up even once, they're contributing to a public nuisance. \n\nThe people who got mad at them might be right to do so, especially if they see the poop in the park. The author's justification might be understandable, but it doesn't excuse the action. There's a responsibility to maintain hygiene and respect for public spaces. So, even though it's a rare occurrence, the author is still in the wrong for those 1% of times. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
