      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The situation is about not picking up their dog's poop every time because some of it is so bad that it makes them throw up when they try to pick it up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person says 99% of the time they do clean up, but once in a hundred times, the poop is so vile that it causes them to vomit when they try to pick it up. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse than the dog poop. Some people got mad at them, hence the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Option A is yes, B is no. \n\nFrom a general perspective, responsible pet ownership typically includes cleaning up after your pet. Laws in many places require pet owners to pick up after their dogs to prevent mess and health issues. However, the author claims that in rare cases, the act of picking up the poop caused them to vomit, leading to leaving it behind. \n\nThe key points here are the frequency and the justification. The author says 99% of the time they do clean up, which shows they are responsible most of the time. The problem occurs in 1% of cases where they can't handle it. The argument is that leaving a vomit would be worse than leaving a poop. But the issue is that they left the poop behind, which is what the other people got mad about. \n\nHowever, the argument that vomiting is worse might not be a valid excuse for not cleaning up. Public areas have rules expecting pet owners to handle their waste, regardless of personal discomfort. Even if it's unpleasant, the expectation is that you carry it out. Also, maybe the person could have handled it differently, like using gloves, a plastic bag, and then washing up, even if it's unpleasant. The vomit argument might be a stretch because the act of picking up the poop is the responsibility, and any discomfort is part of that responsibility.\n\nBut on the other hand, if someone has a genuine physical reaction that makes it impossible to handle in those rare cases, perhaps there's some leniency. However, the problem is that the author is using that as an excuse to not clean up even once in a hundred times, which could still be seen as neglecting their duty in those instances. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the person could have asked someone else to help or used a different method to avoid vomiting. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The author just says they throw up when they pick it up. So maybe it's a personal health issue, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility in those cases. \n\nIn terms of public perception, people might be less understanding. Even if it's rare, leaving any poop in the park is a violation of the norm, and others might not care about the 1% exception. The author's reasoning that vomiting is worse might be their justification, but others could see it as an excuse for not fulfilling their duty in those instances.\n\nTherefore, considering the responsibility of pet owners and the expectation to clean up, the author is in the wrong for not picking up in those 1% cases, even if it's rare. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
