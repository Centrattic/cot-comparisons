      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who didn't pick up their dog's poop is in the wrong. The situation says that 99% of the time, they do clean up, but there's 1% where the poop is so bad it makes them vomit. They left it in the park once because they threw up while trying to pick it up, and some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and responsibilities. In most places, it's illegal not to clean up after your dog. So even if it's a rare occurrence, leaving it there could be against the law. The person argues that leaving vomit in the park is worse, but the law doesn't differentiate between types of waste. Their intent might be to do the right thing most of the time, but that one instance where they failed could still be a problem.\n\nAlso, public responsibility is about maintaining cleanliness for everyone. Even if the situation was extreme, there might be alternative solutions. Like maybe using gloves, having a backup plan, or asking someone else to help. Vomiting is a health hazard too, so maybe they should handle it properly instead of leaving it. The fact that people got mad suggests that the community expects all waste to be cleaned up regardless of the circumstances. So the answer might lean towards AITA being on the side of the author being in the wrong, even if it's a rare case.\n"
