      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop. The context is that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but occasionally, there are these extremely foul poops that make them vomit when they pick them up. They left one such instance in the park, and some people got mad at them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general responsibility of dog owners. Typically, picking up after your dog is considered a basic courtesy and a legal requirement in many places. So the author is mostly doing the right thing 99% of the time. But in these rare cases, they're not cleaning up because the poop is so bad it makes them throw up. \n\nNow, the dilemma here is about balancing personal health and responsibility. If someone is physically unable to clean up due to a medical reaction, that's different from just being lazy. However, the key point is whether they are making an exception too frequently or if the exception is valid. The user says it's 1 in 100 times. So it's a very low occurrence. \n\nBut the issue is that even once is still a failure to clean up. People in the park might not know about the exceptions and just see someone leaving dog poop. The author's defense is that leaving vomit is worse than leaving poop, implying that their reaction is a valid reason. However, that's a bit of a logical fallacy because the presence of vomit isn't the same as failing to clean up. The responsibility isn't about what else might happen, but about fulfilling the duty to clean up regardless of personal discomfort.\n\nAlso, the author could take steps to mitigate the problem. For example, using gloves, cleaning up immediately before the reaction occurs, or having someone else handle it. But the author didn't mention trying these solutions. Instead, they just left it, which might be seen as neglect even if it's a rare occurrence.\n\nLegally, in many places, it's illegal not to clean up after your dog, regardless of the circumstances. So even if it's once in a hundred times, the person is still in violation. Socially, people might be understanding if it's a rare incident, but the people who got mad might not know the context. However, the fact that the author is asking if they're in the wrong suggests they're aware that they didn't clean up and that it's expected.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while the author has a valid reason for the rare instances, the act of not cleaning up, even once, makes them responsible. The responsibility of a pet owner is to always clean up, regardless of personal reaction. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
