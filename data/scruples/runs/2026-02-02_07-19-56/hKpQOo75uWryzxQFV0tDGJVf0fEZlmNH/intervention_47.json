      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about not picking up their dog's poop every time. They say 99% of the time they do, but once in a hundred times, the poop is so bad it makes them throw up. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse than dog poop, and now some people are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and responsibilities. Generally, dog owners are expected to clean up after their pets. It's not just about being a good neighbor but also about public health and cleanliness. If someone doesn't pick up their dog's waste, it can be considered a public nuisance or even a violation of local ordinances. So the basic expectation is that you should clean up every time.\n\nThe person is making an exception once in a hundred times because of an extreme reaction. But even if it's once in a hundred, they are still not cleaning up 1% of the time. That might be a small percentage, but legally and socially, there's no room for exceptions. The argument that vomit is worse is a bit of a red herring because the issue isn't about the vomit but the responsibility to clean up the poop. Also, vomiting might be a personal reaction, but that doesn't absolve them of their duty.\n\nThey also mention that people got mad at them. That suggests that the community expects consistent cleanup. Maybe they should have dealt with the situation differently, like using gloves or finding another method to handle the particularly bad poops without leaving them. There's also the aspect of personal responsibility; if they're so affected by it, they could have taken steps to prevent the vomiting, like wearing protective gear or maybe even using a service to clean up those instances.\n\nSo, even though the situation is unique, the responsibility to clean up is standard. The fact that they throw up doesn't change the obligation. Therefore, the person is in the wrong because they didn't clean up every time, regardless of their reaction.\n"
