      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every time. They mention that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but occasionally, the poop is so bad it makes them throw up. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse, so they don't pick up those rare instances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws and general expectations. In most places, it's a legal requirement to clean up after your dog. Failing to do so can result in fines. The fact that it happened once out of a hundred times might not excuse them, but the reason given is that the poop caused them to vomit. That's a personal reaction, but does that justify not following the law?\n\nThe person's defense is that the alternative (leaving vomit) is worse. However, the law doesn't make exceptions based on individual reactions. Public responsibility is expected regardless of personal discomfort. Even if someone has a valid reason, like a medical issue, they should still handle it properly, perhaps by wearing gloves or using a tool to avoid direct contact.\n\nAlso, the fact that others got mad at them indicates that the community expects poop to be cleaned up, regardless of the circumstances. The person might be in a difficult situation, but the responsibility remains. So, even if it's a rare occurrence, the act of not cleaning up violates the norm and the law. Therefore, the person is in the wrong.\n"
