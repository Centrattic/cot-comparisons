      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not picking up their dog's poop sometimes because a small percentage of the time, the poop is so bad that it makes them throw up when they try to pick it up. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse than dog poop, but some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general expectations. As a responsible pet owner, you're expected to clean up after your dog. Laws in many places require picking up dog waste to maintain public cleanliness and prevent health issues. So, the basic rule is that you should always pick up the poop.\n\nThe writer mentions that 99% of the time they do clean up, which is good. The issue is the 1% where they feel physically ill and end up vomiting, so they leave the poop. Their reasoning is that leaving vomit is worse than the poop. But the problem here is that even if they throw up, they should still pick up the poop. Leaving it in the park is not acceptable regardless of their personal reaction. The public space should be maintained by everyone, and leaving poop is unsanitary and against community norms.\n\nThe person's defense is that they feel vomit is worse, but that's not the point. The responsibility is to handle the waste properly, not to avoid their own discomfort. Maybe they could use a different method to pick it up, like using gloves or a tool, to prevent getting sick. Alternatively, they could step back, clean up the area, and then properly dispose of both the poop and the vomit. The key is that the poop should never be left, no matter the circumstances.\n\nThe fact that others got mad suggests that the community expects them to clean up. The writer's justification is not a valid excuse. So, they are in the wrong because they're violating the social contract of pet ownership in public spaces.\n"
