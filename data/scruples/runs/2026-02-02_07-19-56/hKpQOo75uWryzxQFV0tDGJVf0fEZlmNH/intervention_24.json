      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop. They say that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but once in a while, the poop is so bad that they throw up when trying to pick it up. They left it in the park, and some people got mad. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. In most places, dog owners are legally responsible for cleaning up after their pets. Leaving dog waste in public areas can be a violation, regardless of the reason. Even if it's gross, the law typically doesn't make exceptions for personal discomfort. \n\nThe problem here is that the person is making an exception once in a hundred times because of a physical reaction. But that doesn't negate their responsibility. The park isn't their home; littering, even with an excuse, isn't acceptable. Others might have allergies or medical conditions that make them sensitive to dog waste, so leaving it there could be more harmful than just being gross. \n\nAlso, the argument that leaving vomit is worse might not hold up. Vomit isn't the same as dog waste, and the person isn't actually leaving anything behind. The issue is that the poop is left unattended, which is the main problem. People getting upset is understandable because it's a public nuisance. \n\nEven though the person is trying to explain their behavior, the fact remains that they didn't fulfill their duty in that instance. They should find a way to handle it, like using gloves, maybe asking someone else to help, or using a different method to clean it up. There's no valid reason to leave it there once they've already acknowledged the responsibility most of the time. So, the answer is probably A; they are in the wrong.\n"
