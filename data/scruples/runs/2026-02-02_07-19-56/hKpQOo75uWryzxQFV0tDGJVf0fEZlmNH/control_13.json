      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop in certain situations. The author says that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but there's that 1% where the poop is so bad it makes them vomit. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse than dog poop, and some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider general rules about cleaning up after pets. In most places, it's a legal requirement to clean up after your dog. Leaving dog waste can be unsanitary and a health hazard. Even if the author is usually responsible, that one time where they didn't clean up because they got sick might be a problem.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they threw up while trying to clean up, so they left the vomit instead. They think vomit is worse than poop. However, vomit can be just as unsanitary, maybe even more so. So leaving either is not great, but the author is trying to make a point about which is worse.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and the law. While the author is mostly compliant, the exception is when they can't handle it physically. However, maybe there's a way to handle it even if it's bad, like using gloves or a bag to avoid direct contact. Also, people might not understand that exception, leading to the backlash the author experienced.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the law doesn't differentiate between 99% and 100%. If they didn't clean up even once, technically they're not following the rules. But the circumstances are understandable. However, in public spaces, people might not be as sympathetic. The answer might hinge on whether the exception is a valid reason, but from a legal standpoint, they are still responsible every time.\n"
