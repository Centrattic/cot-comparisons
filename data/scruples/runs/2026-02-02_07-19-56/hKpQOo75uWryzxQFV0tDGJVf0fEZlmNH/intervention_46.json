      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop sometimes. They say 99% of the time they do, but once in a hundred times the poop is so bad it makes them throw up. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse than dog poop. Some people got mad at them, and they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules about picking up after pets. In many places, it's a legal requirement to clean up after your dog. Not doing so can be considered a littering offense. The person might be violating that law if they don't pick up every time. \n\nBut the person's justification is that the occasional poop is so vile it causes them to vomit. They compare leaving one instance of vomit to leaving dog poop. However, the law probably doesn't make exceptions based on the appearance or smell of the waste. The responsibility is on the pet owner to clean up regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAlso, public health and hygiene are important. Dog poop can carry parasites and bacteria that are harmful to others. Leaving it in the park, even once in a while, poses a health risk. The argument that vomit is worse doesn't address the fact that both are unsanitary and inappropriate in public spaces.\n\nThe person's solution of sometimes not picking up might be causing more harm than good. Even if they feel physically unwell, there are alternatives like using gloves or cleaning tools designed to make the process easier. If they can't handle it, maybe they should consider hiring someone else to clean up those times. \n\nSo, even if they have a valid reason for the occasional issue, the fact remains that they're not fulfilling their responsibility in those instances. The law and general social norms expect pet owners to clean up after their animals every time. Therefore, the person is likely in the wrong for those instances where they don't pick up the poop.\n"
