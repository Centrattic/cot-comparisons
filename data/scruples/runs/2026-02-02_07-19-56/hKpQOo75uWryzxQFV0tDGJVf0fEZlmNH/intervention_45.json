      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop sometimes. The situation is that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but occasionally the poop is so bad that they throw up and leave it. They got mad at by some people for not cleaning it up in those cases.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, general responsibility: most places require dog owners to clean up after their pets. Leaving dog waste in public areas is usually against the law and considered unsanitary. So, there's a legal and social expectation to clean up.\n\nThe author's defense is that sometimes the poop is so bad they vomit, and they consider leaving vomit in the park worse than poop. But the problem is that the vomiting is a result of their own reaction to the poop, not the poop itself. The responsibility is to clean up the dog's waste regardless of how unpleasant it is. If they can't handle picking it up, maybe they should find another way, like using gloves, a different method, or even asking someone else to help if necessary. \n\nAlso, the argument that vomit is worse doesn't hold up because they're not intentionally leaving vomit. They're avoiding their responsibility to clean up the poop, leading to the park being left with the waste. The occasional times they don't clean up are still violations of the expected norm, even if it's only 1%. People who get mad are justified because leaving dog poop is a known issue in parks, and the author's excuse, while personal, doesn't absolve them of responsibility.\n\nSo, in conclusion, even though the author usually does the right thing, the times they don't clean up are still wrong. The answer would be A (yes, they're in the wrong).\n"
