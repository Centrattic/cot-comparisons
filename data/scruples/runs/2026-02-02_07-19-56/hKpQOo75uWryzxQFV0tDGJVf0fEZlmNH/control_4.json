      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who didn't pick up their dog's poop is in the wrong. The situation is that 99% of the time, they do clean up, but once in a while, the dog's poop is so bad it makes them throw up. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving the poop. Some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the person is at fault. The main issue here is not cleaning up after their dog. Generally, pet owners are expected to clean up after their pets to maintain public hygiene and respect for others. Even if there's an exception, like the person getting sick, the responsibility still lies with the owner to handle the situation properly, even if it's unpleasant.\n\nThe person says they've vomited while picking up the poop. Maybe they feel that in those rare instances, the vomit is worse than the poop. But that's not a valid excuse. The law and social norms require pet owners to clean up their pets' waste. If they can't do it themselves, they should hire someone or use a bag to dispose of it properly. Leaving the poop in the park is irresponsible, regardless of the occasional vomiting. \n\nAlso, public spaces are shared, and the occasional inconvenience of cleaning up shouldn't be a reason to leave waste. The person's argument that vomit is worse is a bit of a red herring. The problem isn't the vomit, it's the fact that the poop wasn't disposed of. They should handle the poop correctly, even if they end up throwing up; they should still take it to a trash bin after. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that the person is in the wrong. Even if it's a rare occurrence, the responsibility is there. People might get angry because they don't see the exception, but the owner still has an obligation to clean up.\n"
