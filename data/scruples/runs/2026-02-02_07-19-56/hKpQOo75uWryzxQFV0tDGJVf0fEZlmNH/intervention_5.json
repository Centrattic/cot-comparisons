      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop occasionally. The situation is that 99% of the time they do clean up, but 1% of the time the poop is so bad it makes them vomit, and they leave it in the park instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and expectations regarding dog waste. In most public places, especially parks, it's generally required by law to clean up after your dog. Leaving dog poop can be considered a public nuisance and is often against local ordinances. So from a legal standpoint, the writer is violating a rule even if it's a small percentage of the time.\n\nNext, the writer mentions that they sometimes vomit from the experience. That's understandable, but does that excuse not cleaning up? Maybe not. There are solutions like using gloves, possibly using a pooper scooper with a bag that you can seal quickly, or even carrying a small container to store it until you can dispose of it properly. The argument is that leaving it in the park could lead to health issues for others and is unsanitary.\n\nThe writer also says they feel leaving vomit in the park is worse. However, the issue is that they're not cleaning up the poop at all in those instances. Even if they throw up, they should still take steps to clean up the waste properly. Maybe using a bagged pooper scooper or double-bagging it to prevent any contact. Alternatively, they could use a service or enlist help if they're physically unable to do it themselves.\n\nThe fact that others got mad at them suggests that the community expects all poop to be cleaned up, regardless of how unpleasant it is. The writer's defense is that it's a rare occurrence, but even once is too often in terms of public responsibility. So, while the writer's situation is understandable, the act of not cleaning up, even occasionally, is still a violation of social norms and legal requirements. Therefore, they might be in the wrong despite the 1% rate.\n"
