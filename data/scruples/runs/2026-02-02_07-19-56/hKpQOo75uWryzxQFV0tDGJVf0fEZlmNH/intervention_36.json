      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not picking up their dog's poop sometimes because one or two poops are so bad that they make them throw up.\n\nFirst, the general rule is that dog owners are responsible for cleaning up after their pets. It's a common expectation in public spaces to prevent mess and health issues. The writer says they do it 99% of the time, which is good, but the issue is the 1% where they can't handle it due to vomiting.\n\nBut here's the twist: the writer argues that leaving vomit in the park is worse than dog poop. So they're saying they got sick trying to clean up the dog's poop, leading to them not cleaning it. However, the key point is that even if they vomit, they still have a responsibility to clean up after their dog. Vomiting isn't an excuse to leave the poop behind because they can manage it by maybe cleaning up the vomit after. \n\nAlso, the fact that people got mad at them suggests that their actions are affecting others negatively. Public spaces need to be kept clean, and leaving dog waste is a common complaint. The writer's reasoning might be understandable, but the consequence is still leaving the poop, which is against the norm.\n\nSo, while the writer's situation is relatable and shows they're trying their best, the act of not cleaning up even occasionally is what's causing the issue. The responsibility lies with the owner regardless of personal discomfort. Therefore, the answer is likely A (they're in the wrong).\n"
