      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop. The situation is that 99% of the time they do pick it up, but once in a while, when the poop is really bad and makes them vomit, they leave it. They got mad at by some people for this.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical and social norms here. In most places, pet owners are legally and socially responsible for cleaning up after their dogs. Leaving dog poop in public parks is generally considered inconsiderate and unsanitary. It can be a health hazard and a nuisance to others. So the baseline expectation is that you pick it up every time.\n\nThe author argues that in rare cases, the poop is so vile that it makes them vomit when they pick it up, and they feel that leaving vomit is worse than leaving dog poop. But the question is whether this exception justifies not picking it up. \n\nLegally, there's no exception for the texture or smell of the poop. The responsibility is on the owner regardless. Socially, even if it's a rare occurrence, people might not be understanding. The author's solution (leaving it) is causing a problem because others are upset. The author is prioritizing their own comfort over the cleanliness of the park, which is a public space. \n\nEven if the situation is unpleasant, the responsibility remains. There are ways to handle it, like using gloves, cleaning up immediately, or maybe even having a backup plan for those rare cases. The fact that they threw up once doesn't absolve them of responsibility. \n\nSo, while the author's discomfort is understandable, the act of not cleaning up is against societal and legal expectations. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
