      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop every time. They mention that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but once in a while, the poop is so bad it makes them vomit. Because of that, they leave it behind, and some people got mad at them.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are responsibility and public health. Dog owners are generally expected to clean up after their pets to keep parks and public areas clean and safe. Leaving dog waste can be unsanitary and a nuisance to others. But the person argues that in rare cases, the poop is so vile they can't handle it without throwing up. They also say that they've actually vomited while trying to clean it up before.\n\nBut does that excuse not cleaning up? Even if it's one time in a hundred, the expectation is that they should find a way to manage it. Maybe using gloves, a bag with a tight seal, or even asking someone else to help once in a while. Leaving it in the park isn't acceptable, as it's considered a public responsibility to clean up after their pets. The fact that others got mad suggests that the community expects them to handle all instances, not just most. So even if it's difficult once in a while, the person is still responsible for all their dog's waste. Therefore, the answer is probably A, they are in the wrong.\n"
