      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop once in a while because some poops are so bad they make them vomit. They say 99% of the time they do pick it up, but that one time it's so vile they throw up, and they leave it there because they think vomit would be worse than poop.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is responsibility. As a dog owner, you're generally expected to clean up after your pet. Leaving poop in the park is not acceptable, regardless of the reason. Even if the person is physically unable to handle one instance, there are solutions. Maybe they could use gloves, have someone else do it, or use a tool. The fact that they throw up is a personal reaction, but it doesn't excuse not cleaning up. \n\nAlso, public spaces require everyone to be considerate. Vomit might be worse, but the problem is that they're not cleaning up their dog's waste at all. The person's solution is to leave the poop, which is still unsanitary and against common etiquette. Even if it's once in a hundred times, it's still not acceptable. The people who got mad have a valid point because it's about maintaining a clean environment for everyone. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't find an alternative to clean up the poop, even if it was unpleasant. They can't use their physical reaction as an excuse without trying other methods. The answer should be A.\n"
