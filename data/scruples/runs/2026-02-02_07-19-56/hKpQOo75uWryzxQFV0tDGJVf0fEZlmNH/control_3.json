      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop. The situation is that 99% of the time, they do pick it up, but once in a hundred times, the poop is so bad that they throw up when trying to pick it up. They left it in the park, and some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules about picking up dog waste. In most places, it's a legal requirement to clean up after your pets. So not doing so, even occasionally, could be a problem. But the person says it's only 1% of the time, which is a small percentage. However, even a small percentage of times still breaks the law or community rules. \n\nThen there's the health and safety aspect. Dog poop can carry diseases and parasites, so leaving it in the park is unsanitary and a potential hazard to others. Even if the person is throwing up because of the smell, they still need to handle it properly. Maybe they could use gloves or a tool to pick it up without direct contact, reducing the chance of getting sick. \n\nThe person's argument is that leaving vomit is worse, but that's a consequence of their reaction, not the original action. The key issue here is responsibility. As a pet owner, they are responsible for their dog's waste, regardless of the personal discomfort. Even if it's unpleasant, it's part of the duty. \n\nThe people getting mad at them might be right because they're following the rules and expecting the same from others. The person's exception, while understandable, doesn't excuse the violation. There might be alternative solutions, like using a disposal method that's less direct or seeking help from someone else to handle it when they can't. \n\nIn conclusion, even though the situation is rare, the person is still responsible for cleaning up all their dog's waste. Leaving it in the park, even once in a while, is against the rules and inconsiderate to others. So the answer would be that they are in the wrong.\n"
