      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who left the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every time. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person says they usually clean up their dog's poop 99% of the time. But every once in a while, the poop is so bad that they throw up when trying to pick it up. They mention that they've actually vomited before in this situation. Their reasoning is that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop, which is why they don't clean up in those rare cases. Some people got mad at them, so they're wondering if they're the a**hole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the frequency\u201499% clean up, 1% not\u2014and the justification for the exceptions. The person argues that in those rare extreme cases, they can't handle it, and the alternative (leaving vomit) is worse. But others are upset because they expect 100% cleanup.\n\nIn most places, local laws require pet owners to clean up after their pets. So legally, the person might be in the wrong even if it's only 1% of the time. However, the question isn't just about the law but also about social expectations.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, people might not be okay with any exception. Even if it's rare, not cleaning up at all can be seen as irresponsible. The person's defense is that they're trying to avoid a worse outcome (vomit), but others might not see it that way. They might argue that the person should find a way to handle it, like using gloves, carrying extra bags, or maybe even cleaning up the vomit after being sick.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the person's reaction is a genuine medical issue. If they have a condition where touching dog poop triggers vomiting, that's different. But the post doesn't specify that. It just says the poop is \"vile.\" If it's just their personal dislike or a one-time incident, others might not be sympathetic.\n\nAlso, the fact that someone got mad suggests that the community expects all poop to be cleaned up. Even if it's a rare occurrence, the act of not doing it at all might be offensive to others. The person's argument about vomit being worse is a bit of a non sequitur. People might not care that the alternative is worse; they care about their own expectations being met.\n\nSo, legally and socially, the person is probably in the wrong. They're making an exception that others don't accept. Even if it's only 1%, the duty to clean up is absolute in most places. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
