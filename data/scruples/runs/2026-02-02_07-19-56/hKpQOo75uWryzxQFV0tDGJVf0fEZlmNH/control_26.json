      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop. The situation is that 99% of the time, they do pick it up, but once in a hundred times, the dog's poop is so bad that it makes them throw up. They've actually vomited before while picking it up. They feel that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop, which is why they don't pick up those specific poops. Some people got mad at them, so they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of responsible pet ownership. Generally, pet owners are expected to clean up after their pets in public spaces to maintain cleanliness and prevent health issues. Leaving dog poop in parks is typically considered irresponsible and can be against local ordinances. So, the standard expectation is that you should pick up after your dog every time.\n\nThe person argues that in 1% of cases, the poop is so vile that it makes them throw up. They've experienced this and feel that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop. But is that a valid excuse? Well, the problem is that even one instance of not cleaning up can be problematic. The fact that they are physically affected by picking it up is a personal hardship, but does that justify not cleaning up once in a while?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there are laws requiring pet owners to clean up, then not doing so even once could be a violation. From a social standpoint, the park is a shared space, and others might find the presence of dog poop unhygienic or unpleasant. The writer's reasoning is that they don't want to leave vomit in the park, but vomiting is a bodily reaction they can't control. However, the act of not picking up the poop is a choice, whereas vomiting is a result of their physical reaction. But the problem is that the initial reaction (nausea) is triggered by picking up the poop, so they avoid doing it to prevent vomiting, which then leaves the poop behind.\n\nAnother angle is whether there's an alternative solution. For example, could they wear gloves or use a different method to pick up the poop that doesn't make them vomit? If they have a medical issue where certain stimuli cause vomiting, maybe they should consult a healthcare professional. But assuming it's just that the poop is particularly unpleasant, they might need to find ways to handle it without getting sick, like using gloves, a tool, or even asking someone else to help occasionally.\n\nThe key point here is that the responsibility of pet ownership includes cleaning up after the pet. The fact that there's a rare exception where they can't do it because they vomit doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The park users expect that all poop is picked up, not just 99% of the time. Even if it's once in a hundred times, that's still one time too many for others who might be affected by the presence of the poop.\n\nAdditionally, the writer's reasoning that leaving vomit is worse is a bit of a red herring. The vomit is their own body's reaction, but the issue is that they are choosing not to clean up the poop, which is their responsibility. The comparison might not hold because they are responsible for both the poop and their reaction, but they can't use their reaction as an excuse to neglect their responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (AITA: A) because they are not fulfilling their responsibility to clean up after their dog in all instances, even if it's difficult for them. There might be more practical solutions they could explore, but the act of not cleaning up once in a hundred times is still a failure to meet the expected standard.\n"
