      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every time. The scenario is that 99% of the time, they do clean up, but once in a hundred times, the poop is so bad it makes them vomit. They left it in the park once because they felt throwing up would be worse than leaving the poop. Some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general rules about cleaning up after dogs. In most places, it's a legal requirement to pick up after your dog to maintain public hygiene and prevent health issues. Leaving dog waste in parks can spread parasites and bacteria, which is a public health concern. So, from a legal and public health standpoint, the person is supposed to clean up every time, no exceptions.\n\nThe writer's argument is that in rare cases, the poop is so vile it causes them to vomit. But even if that's true, the responsibility to clean up doesn't change. They should have a plan for those instances\u2014maybe using gloves, carrying a disposal bag, or having a backup plan. Throwing up is an extreme reaction, but it doesn't negate the obligation to clean up. Also, if someone is physically unable to handle the waste, they could ask a friend or family member to help, or maybe take the dog to a different area where they can manage it better. \n\nThe other people's reaction shows that their behavior isn't socially accepted. Even if it's a rare occurrence, leaving waste in the park is disrespectful to others using the space and goes against community norms. The writer's justification that vomit is worse doesn't hold up because they chose not to dispose of the poop properly, leading to the vomit. If they had disposed of it but threw up during the process, that's a different scenario. But by leaving the poop, they're contributing to the problem, which is why people are upset.\n\nSo, even though the situation is understandable, the responsibility of cleaning up is non-negotiable. The answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they failed to fulfill their duty to clean up their dog's waste, regardless of the rare exception.\n"
