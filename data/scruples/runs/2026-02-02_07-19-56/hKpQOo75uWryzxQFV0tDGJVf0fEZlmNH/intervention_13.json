      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who didn't pick up their dog's poop is in the wrong. The situation says that 99% of the time, they do clean it up, but occasionally, when the poop is so bad that they vomit while picking it up, they leave it. The question is whether that makes them the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is a dog owner, which typically comes with the responsibility of cleaning up after their pets. There are often laws or neighborhood rules requiring this to keep public spaces clean and safe. Leaving dog waste in the park can pose health risks, spread disease, and create a mess for others.\n\nThe person's defense is that in rare cases, the poop is so vile that they vomit when trying to pick it up. They argue that leaving vomit in the park would be worse. But the problem is that the responsibility lies with the owner to handle their dog's waste properly. Even if it's unpleasant, the owner is expected to find a way to manage it. Maybe they could use gloves, have someone else do it, or use a different method to handle it without getting sick. The fact that they've vomited before suggests they might have a medical issue or a strong reaction, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility. \n\nAlso, the fact that some people got mad at them indicates that others in the community expect them to clean up. The occasional difficulty isn't a valid excuse for not fulfilling a basic responsibility. So, even though the situation is challenging for them, the answer is likely that they are in the wrong. The key point is that the responsibility is on the owner to manage this, no matter how unpleasant it is. They might need to find alternative solutions rather than leaving the waste behind. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
