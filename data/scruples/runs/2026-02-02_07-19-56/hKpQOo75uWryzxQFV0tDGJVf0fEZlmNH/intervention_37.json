      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every single time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author says that 99% of the time, they do pick up their dog's poop and put it in the bin. But there's 1% of the time when the poop is so vile that they throw up when trying to pick it up. They mention that they've actually vomited before while doing this. Their reasoning is that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop, so they choose not to clean up that one instance. However, some people got mad at them for this, leading to the question of whether they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is responsible in almost all cases, but in a small percentage, they're unable to clean up due to a physical reaction. They acknowledge that they're usually compliant but have an exception when it causes them distress. The people around them are upset, so the question is about responsibility.\n\nLegally, in many places, it's required by law to clean up after your dog in public spaces. So if the author doesn't do so, they could be in violation. However, the situation here is that it's a rare occurrence. Ethically, even if it's 1% of the time, the fact that they're not cleaning up at all could be seen as irresponsible, regardless of the reason. But the author's reason is a health-related issue\u2014vomiting due to the smell or appearance of the poop. \n\nBut wait, if someone is so physically affected by their dog's poop that they vomit, maybe there's an underlying issue. For example, could this be a sign of a medical condition, or perhaps the dog's diet? However, that's beyond the scope of the question. The focus is on whether the author is in the wrong for not cleaning up in those rare instances.\n\nThe argument against the author is that even once is too often. Public spaces should be kept clean, and others using the park might be affected by the presence of dog waste. Vomit isn't a legal responsibility for other dog owners, but leaving dog poop is. The fact that the author is usually responsible is a good point, but the 1% still counts. People who encountered the situation might not see the exception and just see someone not cleaning up.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is experiencing a physical reaction, which isn't their fault. They might be trying to prevent a worse situation (vomiting) which could indeed be unsanitary. However, vomit is also unsanitary, but the question is about responsibility. If they can't handle the dog's waste, maybe they should find an alternative solution, like using gloves, a different method, or perhaps consulting a vet about the dog's diet.\n\nIn terms of community standards, it's generally expected that you clean up after your pets. So even if it's rare, the author is still in the wrong for those instances where they don't clean up. The fact that they usually do it shows they know the right thing to do, but the exception is still a problem. The people getting mad at them are justified because the rule is to always clean up, and the author is making an exception, even if their reason is understandable.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though it's a rare occurrence, not cleaning up even once violates the expectation and legal responsibility, regardless of the reason.\n"
