      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every time. The situation is that 99% of the time they do pick it up, but once in 100 times, the poop is so bad it makes them throw up. They've had that happen before and now people got mad at them, so they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general responsibility of dog owners. In most places, it's a legal requirement to clean up after your dog. Leaving dog waste in public parks is not only unsanitary but can also spread disease. So from a legal standpoint, the owner is supposed to pick it up every time.\n\nThe author mentions that in 99% of cases, they do clean up, which is good. The problem arises in that 1% where they can't handle it because of the reaction they have. They argue that leaving vomit in the park is worse, implying they can't handle it without throwing up. However, their reasoning here might not hold because the primary responsibility is to manage the dog waste. If they can't handle it due to their physical reaction, maybe they need to find a solution like using tools (gloves, a bag holder) or asking someone else to help. \n\nThe fact that they left the waste once and got criticized suggests they violated the expectation. Even if it's a rare occurrence, the issue is that they didn't clean up when they had to. People who encounter dog waste in the park are upset because it's a mess and health hazard. The argument about vomit being worse is a bit of a red herring because the vomit was a consequence of their inability to handle the waste, but the initial problem is the uncollected poop. \n\nSo, their reasoning might not excuse them from responsibility. They should have found a way to manage that 1% situation instead of leaving the waste. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they failed to fulfill their duty in that instance, even if it's a small percentage of the time.\n"
