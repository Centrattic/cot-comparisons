      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about not picking up their dog's poop in certain cases where the poop is so bad that it makes them throw up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general responsibility of pet owners. Usually, you're supposed to clean up after your dog in public places. That's a common rule to keep parks and sidewalks clean. But there's a specific exception here: the person says that 99% of the time they do pick up the poop, but in 1% of cases, the poop is so vile that they vomit when picking it up. They've actually thrown up before while doing this. Their reasoning is that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if this is a valid excuse. On one hand, they're not cleaning up in some cases, which could be seen as neglecting their responsibility. On the other hand, the person is experiencing a physical reaction that's preventing them from doing the task. But is that a valid reason? Maybe they can find a solution, like using gloves, a different method, or cleaning it up even if they vomit. They could also argue that the risk of getting sick from not cleaning up is a personal health issue, but they're prioritizing their own comfort over public hygiene.\n\nAnother angle: if someone else might be upset because of the uncollected poop, the person is causing inconvenience. However, the argument is that the alternative (vomit) is worse. But maybe the person should consider that even once is too often. They might need to come up with a plan to handle those rare cases without leaving the poop behind. For example, using a plastic bag to contain the poop and then cleaning up the vomit if necessary. Or maybe they can take the poop home immediately after if they can't handle it.\n\nThe key points are responsibility vs. personal discomfort. The person isn't negligent in most cases, but the exception is problematic. The community might expect 100% compliance with cleaning up. Even once is a failure in their duty. So the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground where they're not entirely to blame because of the extreme reaction. However, there's a solution available, so the fact that they don't use it could make them responsible.\n"
