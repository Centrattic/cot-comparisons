      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop in some cases. They say that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but there's 1% where the poop is so bad it makes them throw up. They feel leaving vomit in the park is worse than dog poop, so they don't clean up those rare instances.\n\nFirst, the legal obligation: In many places, it's a law to clean up after your dog. If they don't, they could get fined. So legally, they might be wrong even if it's only 1% of the time.\n\nThen, there's the social responsibility. Even if it's a small percentage, not cleaning up at all in those cases could be seen as inconsiderate. Others might find the presence of dog poop unpleasant or unsanitary, and the fact that the person is avoiding it because of their own reaction doesn't negate the responsibility.\n\nThe argument that vomit is worse is a bit of a red herring. The problem is that the poop is still there. Even if they throw up while cleaning, the fact remains that they didn't clean it up. Also, maybe they could use gloves or other methods to handle it without getting sick. Maybe they could ask someone else to help or use a different technique.\n\nBut the person does mention that they've done it before and ended up throwing up. So maybe there's a genuine issue with them being physically unable to handle those specific poops. However, that doesn't absolve them of responsibility. They could still find a way to clean it up, like using more protective gear, or maybe getting a helper.\n\nSo while the situation is understandable, the responsibility to clean up is generally expected regardless of personal discomfort. Even a small percentage of not cleaning up can lead to issues. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not fulfilling their duty in all cases, even if rare.\n"
