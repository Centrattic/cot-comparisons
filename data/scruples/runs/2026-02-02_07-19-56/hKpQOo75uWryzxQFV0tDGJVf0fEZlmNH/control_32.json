      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for not picking up their dog's poop. The situation is that 99% of the time they do clean it up, but once in a hundred times, the poop is so bad they throw up when trying to pick it up. They left it in the park, and some people got mad at them, so they're wondering if they're the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general responsibility of dog owners. Typically, pet owners are expected to clean up after their pets in public spaces to maintain hygiene and prevent issues for others. Not doing so can be seen as neglectful or inconsiderate. However, the poster mentions a specific exception where the poop is so vile it makes them vomit. That's a unique circumstance. \n\nThe key here is whether the exception is a valid reason to not clean up. If someone is physically unable to do so due to an adverse reaction, maybe that's understandable. But does that make them not at fault? Well, even if it's unpleasant, there are ways to handle it. For example, using gloves, a plastic bag, or even asking someone else to help. If they were to throw up, maybe they could leave the area to clean up properly instead of leaving it in the park. \n\nAlso, the argument that leaving vomit is worse might not hold up because the primary responsibility is to clean up the poop regardless of the owner's discomfort. The fact that they did vomit might be an unfortunate side effect, but it doesn't absolve them of their responsibility. People might be upset because they see it as a breach of basic courtesy.\n\nAnother angle is consistency. If they usually clean up, why is this one exception acceptable? It's inconsistent behavior. Others might not understand the exception, especially if they don't know the full story. The poster's justification might be valid in their own experience, but from the perspective of others, it's still someone's responsibility to clean up after their pet. \n\nThere's also the aspect of public health. Dog poop can carry parasites and bacteria, so leaving it is a health hazard. Even if the owner is physically affected, the public expects that responsibility. The poster might need to find alternative solutions like using a shovel with a long handle or disposable tools to avoid direct contact. \n\nIn summary, while the situation is unfortunate and the person is clearly trying to be responsible most of the time, the exception doesn't negate their responsibility. They should have found a way to handle the situation even if it made them sick, perhaps by using protective measures or asking someone else to assist. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
