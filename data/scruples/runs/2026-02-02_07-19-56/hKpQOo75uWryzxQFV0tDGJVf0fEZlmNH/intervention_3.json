      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user says they usually pick up their dog's poop, which is good and responsible. But there's this 1% of the time when the poop is so bad that it makes them throw up when they try to pick it up. They mention they've actually thrown up while doing this before. Their reasoning is that leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving dog poop. Some people got mad at them for not picking up the poop, so they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the general responsibility of dog owners. In most places, it's illegal not to clean up after your dog. So the default expectation is that you do pick it up. The person is admitting they don't do it 1% of the time because of this extreme reaction. But is that a valid excuse?\n\nThe argument here is that the person is making a choice not to clean up because of their own physical reaction. Even if the poop is vile, their responsibility as a dog owner includes cleaning up. They might be using their personal discomfort as a reason to avoid the duty. Also, leaving the poop in the park can be unsanitary and unpleasant for others, even if it's only 1% of the time. \n\nHowever, the user does mention that they do clean up 99% of the time, so they're mostly responsible. The key point is the 1% where they can't handle it. But is that a valid excuse? Maybe they could use a different method, like using gloves or a disposal bag to avoid direct contact. Or perhaps they could ask someone else to handle it. The problem is that the person is choosing not to clean up because of their own reaction, which might not be a good enough reason. \n\nAlso, the comparison to vomit is a bit of a red herring. The issue is about the responsibility to clean up, not about which is worse. Even if the alternative is worse, the fact remains that they didn't fulfill their duty. People getting mad is understandable because they expect and rely on others to follow the rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person is in the wrong for not cleaning up that 1% of the time, even if it's a small percentage. The responsibility is there, and using their own reaction as an excuse doesn't negate that. They should find a way to handle it, even if it's unpleasant.\n"
