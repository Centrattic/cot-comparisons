      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not picking up their dog's poop sometimes. They say that 99% of the time they do pick it up, but once in a hundred times, the poop is so bad it makes them throw up when they try to pick it up. They left it in the park, and some people got mad at them.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is the responsibility of pet owners to clean up after their dogs. Generally, I think it's a societal norm to pick up after your pets in public places. Not doing so can be considered inconsiderate, even if the person has a reason. The person claims that the specific instance was because of the poop's condition, but even if that's true, the act of not cleaning up left a mess. Leaving vomit in the park isn't their fault, but the initial failure to clean up the poop is. \n\nThe user's argument is that leaving vomit (from their own reaction) is worse than the poop, but the problem is that they didn't dispose of the poop properly. They might have tried to pick it up but vomited, but if they vomited, maybe they should have still disposed of it or asked someone for help. Or maybe left it temporarily and came back to clean it up. However, the key point is that the poop wasn't picked up at all. People in the park might not know the reason, so they could be upset regardless. \n\nI think the person is in the wrong because the primary responsibility is to clean up after their dog. Even if they had a bad reaction, there's an expectation to handle it. Maybe they can take steps to prevent future issues, like using gloves or training the dog differently. But in this case, the poop wasn't cleaned up, so they are at fault. Answer A.\n"
