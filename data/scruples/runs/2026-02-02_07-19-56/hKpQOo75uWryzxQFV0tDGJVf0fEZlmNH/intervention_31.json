      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not picking up their dog's poop sometimes because one in a hundred poops is so bad it makes them throw up.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules about pet waste. In most places, it's a legal requirement to clean up after your dog. Leaving dog poop in public areas is considered unsanitary and can be a health hazard. So legally, the person might be in the wrong even if it's a small percentage of the time.\n\nThe writer mentions that 99% of the time they do clean up, which is good. But that 1% where they don't because they vomit is the issue. Even if it's rare, the act of not cleaning up at all, even occasionally, could lead to problems. People might find it offensive, and there could be fines. The argument that vomit is worse might be a personal justification, but the responsibility is still on the pet owner to clean up regardless of their feelings.\n\nAlso, there's the social aspect. Public spaces are shared, and everyone should do their part. Even if the person is struggling with a physical reaction, they should find a way to handle it, like using gloves or having someone else help. The fact that others got mad at them shows that the community expects cleanup, so the writer's actions are affecting others negatively.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the majority of the time they're compliant, the occasional failure to clean up makes them responsible. The author is in the wrong because they're not fulfilling their obligation for every instance. Answer A.\n"
