      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong. The question is about not picking up their dog's poop, but with a specific exception. They mention that 99% of the time they do clean up, but there's 1% where the poop is so bad it makes them vomit. They've actually thrown up before while cleaning up, and they think leaving vomit in the park is worse than leaving the poop.\n\nSo, the main issue here is responsibility for cleaning up after their dog. Normally, people are expected to pick up after their pets in public places. But there's a twist here: the person is experiencing a physical reaction that prevents them from doing so in those rare cases. \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the law in many places requires owners to clean up after their dogs. If someone doesn't do that, they might be violating local ordinances. But in this case, the person is almost always compliant, except for these rare instances. \n\nThen there's the health aspect. Dog poop can carry diseases and parasites, so leaving it in the park isn't good for public health. However, if the person is throwing up from the smell or something, maybe there's an underlying issue like a medical condition that makes handling the poop dangerous for them. \n\nThe person argues that leaving vomit is worse than the poop. But the main responsibility is to the park and other people, not just their own discomfort. If they can't handle it, maybe they should find an alternative solution, like using gloves, a mask, or asking someone else to handle it. \n\nBut the scenario is that they had a situation where they ended up vomiting, and others got mad. The question is whether they're at fault. If they're usually responsible, but there's a rare exception due to a physical reaction, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But maybe they should have taken steps to handle that situation differently, like using a disposal method that prevents them from getting sick. \n\nIt's also possible that the people who got mad were upset because they saw the poop left, not knowing the exception. The person's argument is that they're trying to balance their own health against public responsibility. But if there's a way to manage both, like using protective gear, then maybe they should do that instead of leaving it. \n\nIn conclusion, while the person is mostly compliant, the fact that they leave it in some cases because of their reaction might make them at least partially at fault. However, if their reaction is due to a legitimate medical issue, that could be a mitigating factor. But given the information provided, it seems like they should find a way to handle those rare cases, even if it's unpleasant, to fulfill their responsibility.\n"
