      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not picking up their dog's poop sometimes because some of it is so bad it makes them throw up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general rules. Most places require dog owners to clean up after their pets. Leaving dog poop in the park is unsanitary and can be a health hazard. So, from a responsibility standpoint, the owner should always pick it up regardless of how bad it is. Even if one in a hundred times it's really bad, that's still a failure to comply with the rules.\n\nBut the person argues that leaving vomit is worse than dog poop. However, the act of not picking up the poop is still a violation. They might be using their reaction as an excuse. The fact that they've thrown up before while picking it up doesn't absolve them of responsibility. They should have a way to handle it, like using gloves or a different method to avoid getting sick.\n\nAlso, the fact that some people got mad at them suggests that their actions are causing issues for others. The community expects dog owners to clean up, so even if it's once in a while, it's still a problem. There's no justification for not doing it. The person should find a solution to handle the unpleasantness instead of leaving it behind. So, yes, they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
