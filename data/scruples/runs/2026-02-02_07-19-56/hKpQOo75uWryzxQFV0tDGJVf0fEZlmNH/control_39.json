      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop sometimes. The main points are that they usually do pick it up, but occasionally the poop is so bad it makes them vomit. They left it in the park and some people got mad at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general responsibility of pet owners. In most places, there are laws requiring you to clean up after your dog. Leaving poop in public areas is generally frowned upon because it's unsanitary and a health hazard. So, the person is supposed to clean up regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe writer says that in 99% of cases, they do clean up, which is good. The issue is the 1% where the poop is so vile they throw up. But even if they get sick, the responsibility still lies with them to clean up. Maybe they could take steps to prevent that, like using gloves or a different method to pick it up. Alternatively, they could use a disposal bag to handle it without touching it directly.\n\nLeaving the poop in the park, even if they vomit, isn't acceptable. The park is a public space, and others have the right to use it without encountering dog waste. The fact that someone got mad suggests that the community expects them to clean up. The writer's argument that vomit is worse than poop might not hold water because they caused the situation by not cleaning up. Also, their own reaction (vomiting) is a personal issue, not a valid excuse for being inconsiderate to others.\n\nSo, even though they have a rare problem, the correct action is to still clean up. They might need to find a way to handle it better, but leaving it is\u4e0d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684 (irresponsible). Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
