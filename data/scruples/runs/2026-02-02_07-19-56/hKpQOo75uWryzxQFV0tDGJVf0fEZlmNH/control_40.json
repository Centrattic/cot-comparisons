      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not picking up their dog's poop every single time. The author mentions that 99% of the time they do clean up, but there's that 1% where the poop is so bad it makes them throw up. They're conflicted because leaving vomit in the park seems worse than leaving dog poop. Some people got mad at them, so they're questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and responsibilities of pet ownership. Generally, picking up after your dog is a standard expectation in public places. It's about being considerate to others and maintaining cleanliness. The author does a good job most of the time, which shows they're usually responsible. However, there's that rare instance where they can't handle it. The key here is whether the 1% is an acceptable exception given the circumstances.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they vomit, and leaving that in the park is worse. But the problem is, the vomit is a result of their own reaction to the dog's poop. So, they're not just leaving poop; they're also leaving their own vomit. But does that justify not picking up the poop? Maybe not. The initial responsibility is to clean up the poop regardless. If they can't handle it physically, maybe they should find another way, like using gloves, a tool, or even enlisting a friend or a service. However, the author says they've actually thrown up before, so maybe they have a valid physical reaction.\n\nBut from a societal perspective, the expectation is to clean up. Even if it's unpleasant, most people are expected to manage it. If someone can't handle it, maybe they should take steps to prevent that situation. The fact that they left the poop once and got angry from others shows that others see it as a problem. So, even though it's a rare case, the act of not cleaning up that one time could be considered inconsiderate. The solution might involve better preparation, like using a poop bag that's more sturdy or wearing gloves to avoid the disgust response. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is human and has a physical reaction. If they can't control that, maybe they can't be blamed for that specific instance. But the fact remains that they left the poop, which is against the norm. The vomit argument is a bit of a red herring because the main issue is the poop. The vomit is a consequence of their reaction, but the responsibility is on them to handle the poop first. So, even if they vomit, they should still clean up the poop, maybe after dealing with the vomit themselves. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is mostly responsible. While the 1% might be a small percentage, the act of not cleaning up, even once, can be seen as inconsiderate to others. The solution would be to find a way to handle the situation, even if it's unpleasant. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is the asshole, but there's nuance because they do clean up most of the time. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong in the situation described. Since they didn't clean up once and got angry, the answer might be A (Yes), but it's a bit of a tight call. Alternatively, B (No) if the rare exception is considered understandable. But given that the community's reaction was negative, and the expectation is to always clean up, the author is likely in the wrong for that one instance.\n"
