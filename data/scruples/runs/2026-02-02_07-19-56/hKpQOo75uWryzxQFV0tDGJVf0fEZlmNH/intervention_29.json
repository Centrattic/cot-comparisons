      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not picking up their dog's poop sometimes because one in a hundred times, the poop is so bad that it makes them vomit. They left it in the park, and some people got mad. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The main points are:\n\n1. The person usually picks up their dog's poop (99% of the time).\n2. Occasionally, the poop is so vile it makes them throw up when picking it up.\n3. They left it in the park once, leading to people being upset.\n\nThe core issue is responsibility versus personal discomfort. In most places, there are laws requiring pet owners to clean up after their pets. Leaving dog waste in public areas can be considered littering, which is both unsanitary and against the law in many areas. \n\nEven if the person is experiencing a physical reaction, the responsibility to clean up remains. Vomiting in the park is indeed unsightly, but the act of not cleaning up the poop is the primary issue here. The person could have handled the situation differently, such as by using gloves, a plastic bag, or even a tool to pick it up without direct contact. If they were already vomiting, maybe they could have used that moment to clean it up, or asked someone else for help. \n\nThe argument that the poop is too vile might be a stretch. While it's understandable that some waste might look worse than others, the responsibility doesn't change. People might have different thresholds for what they can handle, but that doesn't absolve them of the duty to clean up. The person's solution (leaving it) is not acceptable, regardless of the reason. \n\nThe person might feel that their physical reaction is a valid excuse, but society generally expects people to manage such situations. If the problem is recurring and causing distress, they might need to find alternative solutions, like using protective gear or training the dog differently, rather than leaving the waste. \n\nSo, considering the usual expectations and laws, the person is in the wrong. They should have found a way to clean up even if it was unpleasant. Leaving it in the park is not acceptable, even if they felt it was worse to leave vomit. The responsibility to clean up is non-negotiable in public spaces.\n"
