It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was on Do Not Disturb mode. They complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and interrupting people who were asleep. Now they're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) because the child was found dead, and people are saying that complaining is bad since there's a dead kid involved.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the arguments. The author is upset that the Amber Alert system overrides their DND settings, which they had intentionally set. They argue that it's not practical for people to help spot a car from 58 miles away and five hours later, especially when they're asleep. They also mention their personal struggles, like being unemployed and their wife's long commute. Then they point out the Catch-22 situation where if the child was found alive, people would say the alert worked, but now that she's dead, they're called insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the counterargument is that the Amber Alert system is designed to maximize the chance of finding a missing child quickly, even if it means disturbing people. The fact that the child was found dead might make some people feel that any criticism in such a tragic situation is inappropriate. But others might sympathize with the author's frustration about the system's design and the disruption it caused.\n\nI should consider the intent of Amber Alerts. They are emergency notifications to help locate abducted children, which is a critical public safety issue. The system is set up to override normal notifications because the urgency is high. However, the author's complaint is about the system's overreach, specifically targeting people who have chosen to silence their phones. This raises a valid point about user settings versus emergency needs. \n\nBut then, in an emergency, overriding certain settings might be necessary. However, the author's main argument is about the nuance\u2014like not overriding DND or allowing users to opt out of such alerts. They suggest technical solutions like a software switch for alerts. The author isn't against Amber Alerts per se; they're advocating for a more thoughtful implementation. \n\nThe emotional context is also important. The author mentions their personal hardships and their family's situation, which might make their complaint more about the stress of being disturbed at midnight when they were already under pressure. The Catch-22 they mention shows they're aware of the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nNow, considering if they're in the wrong. Being concerned about the system's design doesn't make them an asshole. People can have legitimate criticisms about how emergency alerts are handled without being insensitive. The author isn't dismissing the tragedy; they just want the system to be more effective and considerate. However, the fact that they complained publicly and called out the system's flaws might be seen as callous by some, especially given the tragic outcome. \n\nBut is it wrong to question the system's effectiveness? If the alert didn't help in the end, then complaining about its method might be harder to justify. Yet, the system's purpose is to act quickly, and in this case, it didn't prevent the tragedy. The author's frustration is about the balance between public safety and individual privacy/settings. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's complaint is reasonable. If the Amber Alert system is designed to override DND for emergencies, then maybe the author's frustration is valid in terms of system design needing improvement. However, the public reaction might be harsh because of the tragic outcome. But the author isn't against the alerts; they just want them to be smarter. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their criticism is about the system's implementation rather than the tragedy itself. They're suggesting improvements and pointing out potential inefficiencies. Even though the outcome was tragic, questioning the system's effectiveness isn't inherently wrong. People can have constructive criticism without being insensitive.\n"
