It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. The person complained about it on Facebook, arguing that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly or at midnight to phones in DND. They also mention their context of being unemployed and having their wife as the sole breadwinner, who had to cut their Valentine's evening short.\n\nThe key points here are the Amber Alert system's purpose versus the disruption caused. The person is frustrated that the alert interrupted their sleep, even though it's a serious situation. They argue that the system should be more nuanced, maybe allowing users to opt-in for alerts if they have DND on. However, the twist is that the child was later found dead, which complicates the argument. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider the moral implications here. On one hand, Amber Alerts are crucial for public safety to help locate missing children quickly. The system prioritizes reaching as many people as possible, even if it means interrupting sleep. The author's complaint might be seen as insensitive given the tragic outcome. But on the other hand, the system's effectiveness depends on public cooperation, and there's a valid point about the balance between public safety and individual privacy/space. \n\nHowever, the author's initial reaction, especially given the outcome, could be perceived as callous. Even if they had valid technical arguments, expressing frustration publicly when the alert's purpose is to save lives might come off as heartless. The fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight, so people might be more forgiving of the system's intrusion if it could have helped save the child. The author's argument about the system's flaws is valid, but the timing and tone of the complaint could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's stance on the system's flaws isn't entirely wrong, but the way they expressed their complaint, especially after the tragic result, might make them appear insensitive. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but there's a nuanced perspective here. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The system's purpose is to save lives, and complaining about the disruption might be seen as prioritizing personal convenience over a critical public safety measure, especially in hindsight. So the answer is A.\n"
