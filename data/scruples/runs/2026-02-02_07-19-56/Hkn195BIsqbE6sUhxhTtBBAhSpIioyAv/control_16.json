It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their phone, which was on Do Not Disturb. The person complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disturbing people who were asleep. They argue that the system should be more nuanced, maybe respecting DND settings or allowing users to opt in. Then the twist is that the child found dead, so some might say complaining is wrong because of the tragedy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Amber Alerts are meant to alert people about child abductions, which is a serious and time-sensitive matter. The system's purpose is to mobilize the public to help find a missing child quickly. But the person is raising a valid point about disruptions. If someone's phone is on DND, maybe they shouldn't be disturbed unless it's a life-threatening emergency. But Amber Alerts are considered emergencies, so overriding DND could be justified. However, the effectiveness of the alert at midnight might be questionable since most people are asleep and not likely to notice a car from five hours ago. \n\nThe author's argument is about balance: public safety vs. personal privacy and peace. They also mention their personal struggles and family context, which might explain their frustration. On the other hand, the tragic outcome of the child's death might lead some to think that any complaints are insensitive. But the author's point isn't to minimize the tragedy; they're critiquing the system's approach. \n\nIt's a Catch-22 situation. If the alert worked and saved a life, complaints might be seen as ungrateful. If the child is found dead, some might think the alert was in vain. However, the author's concern is about the system's flaws, not dismissing the importance of Amber Alerts. They're suggesting improvements, which is a constructive criticism. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're pointing out a real issue with emergency alerts disrupting sleep and possibly not being effective at that time. Their complaints were directed at the system, not the tragedy itself. People who contacted authorities to complain were voicing concerns about the alert's broad distribution, which could be seen as a valid critique rather than callousness. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
