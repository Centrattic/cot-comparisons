It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted an Amber Alert complaint on Facebook is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert going off at midnight on a phone set to Do Not Disturb. The author complains about the alert being too broad and disruptive, especially since they were asleep. Later, the child was found dead, which complicates things because people might think the author is being insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. They're meant to quickly spread information about abducted children, relying on the public to help locate them. The system is designed to be urgent and reach as many people as possible, even overriding DND settings. The author argues that it shouldn't override DND and should be more nuanced, like only alerting devices not in DND or having a software switch. They also mention their personal situation\u2014unemployment, family responsibilities\u2014to provide context for their frustration.\n\nNow, the key points here are the ethical implications. On one hand, the Amber Alert's primary goal is to save lives, so when it's active, the urgency is high. The author's complaint is about the method of delivery being too intrusive. On the other hand, the author's frustration might be justified if the system is causing unnecessary disturbances without clear effectiveness. The fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight, making some people feel that complaining about the alert is callous. However, the author's argument isn't about opposing Amber Alerts in general but about the delivery method and targeting.\n\nAnother angle is the Catch-22 the author mentions. If the child had been found alive, the alert would be praised, but now that the child is dead, the same alert is criticized. This suggests a bias in public opinion based on the outcome, which the author points out. The author isn't opposing the purpose of Amber Alerts but is critiquing the implementation. They're advocating for a system that's less disruptive while still effective. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's complaint is about the system's design rather than the necessity of Amber Alerts. Their frustration is understandable, given the personal context and the disruption caused. However, the immediate reaction might be to label them as inconsiderate because the alert was for a life-threatening situation. But the core issue is whether the system's method is appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for questioning the effectiveness and intrusiveness of the alerts, especially when they propose alternatives. The emotional response to the tragedy might cloud judgment, but the right or wrong isn't solely determined by the outcome. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
