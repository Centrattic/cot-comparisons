It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone at midnight even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. They posted a complaint on Facebook, arguing that the alert shouldn't be sent so broadly and shouldn't override DND settings. Then they mention that the girl was found dead, which complicates the situation because some people might now think complaining about the alert is heartless.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the purpose of an Amber Alert. They're designed to quickly spread information about a missing child, right? The idea is that as many people as possible might see the alert and help find the child. But the author's phone was on DND, which they intentionally set to avoid disturbances. So the question is whether the system should override DND for such alerts.\n\nThe author's argument is that if people have their phones on DND, especially at midnight when they're likely asleep, they can't help anyway. So sending the alert to those devices is unnecessary and disruptive. They also suggest that maybe there should be a separate setting for emergency alerts, which makes sense. But others might argue that in emergencies like child abductions, it's crucial to reach everyone possible, even those who might be asleep, because time is of the essence.\n\nThen there's the additional context that the girl was found dead. This might make some people feel guilty about complaining, thinking that maybe if the alert had reached more people, she could have been found earlier. However, the author's point is that the system's approach is too broad and not nuanced. They're not against the alert itself but the way it's implemented\u2014especially overriding DND settings.\n\nI should consider the balance between public safety and individual privacy/quiet time. Amber Alerts are a public service, but having them override DND could be seen as an invasion of privacy, especially if the alert is for a situation that's not in the immediate vicinity. The author's concern about the alert's reach and timing is valid because if the child was already in a different area 58 miles away, maybe the alert didn't need to be sent that far. Plus, if the tech was more refined so that only non-DND phones received it, it would be less disruptive but still effective.\n\nThe part where the author mentions their wife's situation adds a personal touch. They were in a tough situation with unemployment and their wife's long commute. Maybe they were just stressed and didn't want to be disturbed at night. But does that excuse complaining about a life-saving alert, even if it was a mistake? The tragedy of the girl's death might make people more sensitive to any criticism, thinking that every alert is vital. However, the author isn't saying the alert shouldn't exist; they're suggesting it should be more targeted or have better settings to avoid waking people up unnecessarily.\n\nI wonder if there's a technical reason why the Amber Alert system can't respect DND settings. If it's a matter of overriding for emergencies, then it's intentional. But if it's a flaw in the system, then the author's complaint is about a system issue rather than the alert itself. The author also points out a Catch-22 where the same people who complain would praise the system if the alert had worked. That's a bit of a meta point about how people view these alerts based on outcomes.\n\nSo, the core of the issue is the implementation of Amber Alerts. If the system is designed to override DND for all alerts, then the author is following the correct protocol by having DND on, and the system has a problem. The author isn't at fault for pointing out a flaw. On the other hand, if Amber Alerts are supposed to override DND regardless of the time, even if it's disruptive, then maybe the author's complaint is valid but they're still in the wrong for being upset about a system that's meant to handle emergencies.\n\nBut considering that Amber Alerts are a critical tool for public safety, the system's design might prioritize immediate notification over individual settings. However, the author's reaction is about the system's effectiveness and respect for user preferences. If the alert was sent to a wide area when the child was already 58 miles east, maybe the system isn't working efficiently. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for questioning the approach.\n\nAlso, the author's wife had to leave early for work, so maybe they were in a situation where being disturbed at midnight could affect their family's responsibilities. But the main point is the system's overreach rather than a malicious intent. The author isn't blaming the child's death on the alert but is critical of the method used, which could lead to improvements.\n\nIn the end, it's a tough situation. The author is likely not in the wrong for pointing out that the system's implementation has issues. They're advocating for better targeting or user control, which could help in future cases. Even though the outcome was tragic, the author's complaint is about the system's design, not the necessity of the alert itself. So the answer might be B (No), they're not in the wrong.\n"
