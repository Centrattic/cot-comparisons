It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post about complaining about an Amber Alert is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author's phone was on Do Not Disturb mode, but they still got a loud Amber Alert at midnight. They complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disturbing people who were asleep. Their arguments are that the tech shouldn't override DND settings and that people asleep aren't in a position to help spot a car from hours ago. Then there's added context that the child found dead, which complicates things because now some might think the complaint is insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're meant to quickly disseminate information about abducted children to increase the chance of recovery. The system is designed to be urgent and reach as many people as possible, even if it means interrupting sleep. But the author's point is about the balance between public safety and individual privacy/interruption. \n\nThe author's complaint is about the system's design\u2014overriding DND, broad distribution. They're not saying the alert shouldn't exist, but that the implementation could be more nuanced. They also mention that many others called police to complain. The twist is the child was found dead, which might make some people feel the complaint is callous. However, the author also mentions their personal situation, like unemployment and their wife's work stress, which could add context to their frustration.\n\nNow, the key question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, Amber Alerts are critical for safety, and complaining about being disturbed might seem insensitive, especially after the tragic outcome. But the author's argument is about the system's effectiveness and respect for individual settings. They're not dismissing the importance of the alert system but suggesting improvements. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing a valid concern about the system's design. The fact that others also complained suggests it's a common issue. The author's stance is that the system could be better designed to target only those who are likely to help, rather than broadly interrupting everyone. This is a reasonable critique of the technology's implementation.\n\nThe tragic outcome complicates things. If the alert had led to the child's recovery, some might argue that complaining was inappropriate. But since the child was found dead, some might feel the alert didn't make a difference, which could validate the author's point that the broad alert wasn't effective. However, the author's intention wasn't to downplay the situation but to critique the system's design.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out flaws in the Amber Alert system. They\u2019re advocating for a balance between public safety and personal privacy. Their complaint isn't about the necessity of Amber Alerts but about how they're delivered. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
