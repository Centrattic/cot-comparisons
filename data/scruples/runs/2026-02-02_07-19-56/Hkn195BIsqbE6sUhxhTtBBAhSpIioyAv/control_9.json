It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Amber Alert\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author was asleep with their phone on Do Not Disturb, and got an Amber Alert at midnight, which was loud and disruptive. They complained online about it being too broad and sent to phones that were on mute. They also mentioned their personal context\u2014unemployed, wife is the main earner, kids, etc. Then the twist is the child was found dead, which complicates things. The author argues it's a Catch-22 where people either complain or praise depending on the outcome.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. Amber Alerts are urgent and intended to alert people to child abductions. They override DND settings because the priority is safety. The author is upset about being woken up and thinks the system isn't nuanced enough. But when the child dies, people might say the author is an \"asshole\" for complaining, as the alert didn't prevent the tragedy.\n\nBut the author's argument is that the system is flawed. They suggest improvements like not overriding DND unless the user explicitly allows it. Also, they mention that people in their situation (asleep with DND on) might not be able to help spot the car. However, the tragedy's outcome makes the situation more sensitive.\n\nIs the author wrong for complaining? Well, the system's design is to maximize reach in emergencies. Even if the alert didn't help in this case, the purpose is to increase chances of recovery. Complaining about the disruption might seem insensitive if a child dies, but the author's frustration is about the system's overreach. They're suggesting a more balanced approach, not dismissing the alert's importance.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether complaining about the alert's design is valid despite the tragic outcome. The author isn't denying the alert's necessity but is pointing out flaws in its implementation. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
