It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what an Amber Alert is. They're emergency alerts for missing children, right? So the purpose is critical\u2014potentially saving a child's life. The author was disturbed at midnight when their phone, set to DND, blared an alert about an Amber Alert. They complained on Facebook about the broad distribution and the override of DND settings. Then they're questioning if they're an asshole because the child was later found dead.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author argues that the alert shouldn't have been sent to people with DND on, especially at midnight. They think the tech should be more nuanced, maybe allowing users to opt-in. But others might say that in such critical situations, the system needs to reach as many people as possible, even if it disturbs sleep. The fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight, making some people think that complaining about the alert is insensitive.\n\nBut the author also mentions their personal situation\u2014unemployed, wife as the main breadwinner with a long commute, kids. They might be stressed and the alert was an unwelcome disturbance. However, the primary purpose of Amber Alerts is to mobilize the public quickly when a child is in danger. The system's design prioritizes reaching everyone possible, even if it means some inconvenience.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a valid point about the system's lack of nuance. It's reasonable to question why DND settings weren't respected. But the context of a child's life being at risk complicates things. However, the child was found dead, which might lead some to view the complaint as trivializing the situation. But the author's complaint isn't about the alert's purpose but its execution. They\u2019re not against Amber Alerts but about how they\u2019re delivered. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges the Catch-22: if the alert had saved the child, critics would say it worked; if not, they're seen as heartless. The author is pointing out a systemic issue rather than dismissing the alert's importance. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (No), because the author is raising a valid critique about the system's design without dismissing the urgency of Amber Alerts. They're not the asshole for pointing out a flaw in the approach, even if the outcome was tragic.\n"
