It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. They complained about this on Facebook, arguing that the alert shouldn't have been so broad or disruptive. Now, the girl in the Amber Alert was found dead, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. Amber Alerts are meant to warn people about abducted children, relying on the public to help locate them. The author is upset that the alert interrupted their DND mode. They have a valid point about being asleep and not being able to help. However, the tragedy of the case\u2014finding the girl dead\u2014adds emotional weight.\n\nThe author's complaint might seem insensitive after the fact. But they also mention their personal context: unemployed, wife as the sole provider, and family concerns. They didn't express a lack of empathy initially; they just criticized the system's approach. The catch-22 they mention is that if the child was found alive, the same complaints might be dismissed as valid for helping, but since she died, they're being called insensitive.\n\nI need to weigh the balance between public safety and personal disruption. Amber Alert systems are designed for maximum reach, even if that means being intrusive. The author's frustration about the system overriding DND is understandable, but in a situation where a child's life is at risk, the priority is to alert as many people as possible. The tragedy might make people feel that any criticism is inappropriate, but the author's intention wasn't to cause harm. They were pointing out a flaw in the system's design. However, in the context of the outcome, it's easy to see why others might view their complaint as tone-deaf, especially in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy.\n\nOn the other hand, the system's effectiveness relies on public cooperation. If the author's main point is about improving the system (like allowing opt-out for DND or more targeted alerts), that's a valid technical critique. But in the heat of the moment, especially when a child has died, people might be less forgiving of such complaints.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They expressed frustration with a system's flaw, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the sensitivity of the situation, especially with a tragic outcome, might lead some to see their complaint as missing the point. The answer could depend on whether their criticism was constructive versus dismissive of the alert's purpose. Since they did propose alternatives (like a software switch), their intent was to improve the system, not to trivialize the issue. Still, the timing and the emotional impact after the tragedy might cloud that intent.\n"
