It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that was sent at midnight, overriding the phone's Do Not Disturb setting. The author complained about it on Facebook, arguing that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly or at such an inconvenient time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of Amber Alerts. They are designed for emergency situations involving abducted children, aiming to quickly disseminate information to the public. The priority is to alert as many people as possible in the affected area to help locate the missing child. However, the author is upset because the alert disrupted their sleep and they question the necessity of overriding DND settings.\n\nThe author's main argument is that people who have their phones on Do Not Disturb are probably asleep and not in a position to help. They also mention personal struggles, like unemployment and their wife's work demands, which adds context to their frustration. However, the twist is that the child was found dead, which complicates the moral perspective. Critics might say that complaining about the alert in this case is insensitive given the tragic outcome.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The key factors here are the intent of the Amber Alert system and the author's right to voice their opinion. Public safety emergencies often require broad, immediate communication, even if it means disrupting people's routines. The author's complaint is about the method of delivery rather than the alert itself. They're suggesting a more nuanced approach, which is a valid point from a user experience or technological standpoint. However, in an urgent situation, the system's design prioritizes reaching as many people as possible, even if it's intrusive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. Being woken up abruptly can be stressful, especially when they're dealing with personal hardships. Their concern about the alert's effectiveness\u2014since the child was already abducted and the chances of immediate help might be low\u2014is also a point. However, the system isn't perfect, and there's a balance between public safety and individual privacy/comfort.\n\nThe tragic outcome of the child's death might make people more sympathetic to the alert's necessity, but the author's initial complaint was about the system's methodology, not the outcome. The fact that the alert was sent even when devices were on DND could be seen as a flaw in the system that the author is pointing out, which is a constructive criticism. However, some might view the complaint as insensitive given the result, but that's more about the timing of the complaint rather than its validity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is a critique of the system's approach, which could be valid. While the method of delivering alerts might need improvement, the primary goal of public safety is paramount. However, the author isn't inherently in the wrong for expressing concerns about the system's impact on personal life, even if it's a sensitive situation. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
