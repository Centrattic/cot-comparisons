It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that interrupted their phone's Do Not Disturb setting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Amber Alerts are critical for public safety, especially when a child is missing. The alert in question was sent at midnight, which is a time when most people are asleep. The author had their phone on DND, which they intentionally set to avoid disturbances. The alert, however, bypassed that setting, causing disruption.\n\nThe author's complaint is about the system's lack of nuance. They argue that the alert shouldn't override DND mode and that the system should be more targeted. This seems reasonable because DND is meant to respect user preferences for not being disturbed. The author isn't denying the severity of the situation; they even mention their family's current struggles and their concern for children's safety.\n\nThe twist is that the child was found dead later. Some might argue that any criticism in such a tragic outcome is insensitive. However, the author's point is about improving the system to be more effective in the future, not minimizing the tragedy. They acknowledge the Catch-22 of public reaction, which shows they understand the emotional aspect.\n\nThe key here is balancing public safety with individual privacy and user experience. Amber Alerts need to be urgent, but there's room for improvement in how they're delivered. The author's suggestions, like a software switch for alerts, could prevent unnecessary disruptions while still allowing those who opt-in to receive them. It's a valid critique of the system's current design.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out a flaw in the alert system. They're advocating for a better balance between safety and user control. Even with the tragic outcome, their argument is about systemic improvement rather than insensitivity.\n"
