It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their phone, which was set to Do Not Disturb. The author complained about the alert being too broad and disrupting their sleep. Then, they acknowledge that the child found dead, which complicates the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're designed to quickly disseminate information about abducted children to the public, increasing the chance of finding them alive. The system is supposed to override normal phone settings to ensure maximum reach. The author argues that overriding Do Not Disturb is problematic, especially at night when people are asleep and less likely to help. \n\nBut then there's the other side: when a child is in danger, every second counts. Even though the alert might have disturbed people, it could have been crucial for someone to notice the car. The author also mentions that the child was found dead, which might make people judge the complainers more harshly. There's the catch-22 they mentioned: if the alert had led to a successful rescue, people would say it worked, but since it didn't, they're called inconsiderate.\n\nI need to think about the balance between public safety and individual privacy/comfort. While it's understandable to be upset about being woken up, the system's primary goal is to save lives. However, the author's points about nuance\u2014like allowing users to opt-in or adjust settings\u2014might be valid. But in an emergency, overriding DND makes sense. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. The author isn't indifferent; they care about the child's safety. Their complaint is about the system's effectiveness and respect for user settings. However, after the tragic outcome, their complaint might seem trivial to some. \n\nIn the end, it's a complex issue. The author isn't in the wrong because they're not ignoring the need for Amber Alerts. They're suggesting improvements. But maybe they should have considered the urgency before posting their complaint, especially after the child's death. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A or B? The user thinks A, but I'm a bit torn. But the main point is whether the author is wrong for complaining. Given that Amber Alerts are meant to override for emergencies, and the author acknowledges the system's intent but questions its execution, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. They're raising a valid concern about the system's design. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that in such a case, the system needs to be as broad as possible regardless of personal inconvenience. I think the answer is B.\n"
