It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone, even though it was on Do Not Disturb. They complained on Facebook about it, and now they're feeling conflicted because the child was found dead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The amber alert system is designed to get as much public assistance as possible to find a missing child. These alerts are typically sent out to a wide area because the abductor might not be known, and the child's safety is critical. The person is upset that the alert went off at midnight when their phone was on DND, which they had set intentionally. They feel it's disruptive and not effective because people are asleep and can't help. They also mention their personal situation with unemployment and their wife's work stress as context for their frustration.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, the amber alert system is a public safety tool. When a child is in danger, the system is supposed to mobilize the community quickly. The fact that the alert was sent out even to phones on Do Not Disturb might be a known issue. Some people might argue that the system's priority is to reach as many people as possible, even if it's intrusive. The author is pointing out a flaw or possible overreach in the system's design, suggesting that it should have more nuance, like respecting DND settings unless the user has opted in for emergency alerts.\n\nOn the other hand, the emotional impact of the situation is significant. The child was found dead, so some people might say that any complaints about the alert are insensitive. However, the author's argument isn't about the child's well-being but about the system's effectiveness and intrusiveness. They do mention they wouldn't want harm to come to their own kids, which shows empathy. They're advocating for a better system that's both effective and less disruptive. \n\nThe catch-22 they mention is valid. If the alert had been successful in finding the child alive, the complaints might be seen as justified because the system worked. But because the outcome was tragic, some might feel that the complaints are inconsiderate. However, that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong in pointing out a systemic issue. Public systems should be evaluated for their effectiveness and impact, not just based on the outcome of a single incident.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is raising a valid point about the balance between public safety alerts and individual privacy/disruption. While the amber alert's intent is good, the method of delivery might have room for improvement. The author isn't against the alerts but wants them to be more targeted or respecting user settings. Therefore, they're not in the wrong for expressing a concern that could lead to better policies in the future.\n"
