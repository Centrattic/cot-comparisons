It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert. The key points here are that the alert was sent out at midnight, even though their phone was on Do Not Disturb. They posted on Facebook about it being too broad and disrupting people who are asleep. Then they mention that the child was found dead, which might make people think the author is insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're designed to quickly disseminate information about child abductions to help in their recovery. So the system's intent is to alert as many people as possible in the area where the child might be. But the author is making a point about the system overriding DND settings. That's a valid technical concern\u2014maybe the system isn't nuanced enough. They suggest alternatives like a software switch for alerts, which makes sense because not everyone might want to be alerted in the middle of the night, especially if it's a false alarm or if they can't help.\n\nThe author also provides personal context: they're unemployed, their wife is the sole breadwinner with a long commute, so he was thinking about her needing rest. He has kids of his own. These details might explain why he's frustrated, especially if he's under stress and the alert disrupted their sleep. Then the twist is the child was found dead, which could make people feel like complaining is wrong because the outcome is tragic. But the author is pointing out a Catch-22 where people criticize the alert's reach depending on the outcome.\n\nSo, the question is about whether his complaint is justified. On one hand, the Amber Alert system is crucial for public safety and quick response. On the other hand, it's a system that can be improved. The author isn't saying he doesn't care about the child; he's raising a concern about how the system works. People who complain about being woken up might be seen as callous, but he's making a reasonable technical argument for better implementation. The fact that he also has a personal situation where his wife's rest was compromised adds to his perspective.\n\nHowever, the outcome (child found dead) might lead some to think that any complaint is insensitive, but that's a common reaction. The author's point is that the system's broad alerting without considering DND settings is flawed. If the alert is meant to help, maybe there's a way to do it without disturbing people who are asleep. He's not against the system but wants it to be more effective and respectful of user settings.\n\nIn the end, the author's criticism is about the system's design, not the child's safety. So I think he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
