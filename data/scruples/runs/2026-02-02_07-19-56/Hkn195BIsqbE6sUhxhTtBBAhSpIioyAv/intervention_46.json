It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on a phone set to Do Not Disturb. The author complained about this, arguing that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to people who were asleep. Then the child was found dead, which complicates the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. They're meant to quickly disseminate information about abducted children, potentially saving their lives. The system overrides normal notifications to ensure people get the message. But the author's point is that people with Do Not Disturb on might not be in a position to help, like if they're asleep. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot financially and mentions their wife's work situation. They might be frustrated because the alert interrupted their rest. However, the alert's goal is urgency. Even if the author didn't see the car, the alert might have helped others. \n\nNow, the fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight. Some might see the author's complaint as insensitive because the outcome was tragic. But the author argues it's a Catch-22, where complaints would be about the alert's effectiveness depending on the outcome. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, the alert's intent is critical, and complaining about it might seem heartless. On the other hand, the system's design could be improved to be less intrusive for those in Do Not Disturb. The author isn't denying the severity of the situation but is pointing out a flaw in the system. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the complaint is seen as valid criticism of the system rather than insensitivity. The author isn't ignoring the problem but suggesting a better approach. So maybe they aren't in the wrong. But others might argue that in a life-or-death situation, the system's broad reach is necessary despite the inconvenience. \n\nThe key is whether complaining about the method is wrong when the goal is noble. I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author's concern is about the system's effectiveness and unintended intrusiveness, not the child's safety.\n"
