It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone despite being on Do Not Disturb, and they complained about it on Facebook. The key points to consider are their complaint's validity, the context of the alert, and the outcome where the child was found dead.\n\nFirst, the Amber Alert system is designed to quickly disseminate information about abducted children. It's important for public safety, so overriding DND makes sense in emergencies. However, the author's complaint about the alert being too broad and disruptive at midnight is understandable. People might feel that the system should have more nuance, like not disturbing those who are asleep but have their phones on DND. Their points about the practicality\u2014like people not being able to help at that hour\u2014are valid arguments for reforming the system.\n\nThe author also mentions their personal situation: unemployed, wife as the sole breadwinner with a long commute, and kids. This context adds to their frustration, showing they're stressed and possibly overworked. Their concern isn't just about the alert itself but the timing and how it affects people's lives.\n\nHowever, the complication arises because the child was found dead. Critics might argue that complaining about the alert sounds heartless, given the tragic outcome. But the author isn't denying the tragedy; they're pointing out the system's flaws. They acknowledge the Catch-22 where people might flip-flop their stance based on the outcome, which shows they're aware of the ethical dilemma.\n\nThe question is whether the author's complaints make them the \"asshole.\" The answer hinges on whether their criticism is valid despite the tragic result. Since the Amber Alert system's effectiveness and ethical use in emergencies are debatable, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're advocating for a better system rather than dismissing the importance of the alert. Plus, contacting authorities to express concerns is part of civic responsibility, not just complaining out of spite.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Their stance is about improving the system, not minimizing the tragedy. The correct answer is B.\n"
