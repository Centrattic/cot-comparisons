It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert. The situation is that the author was woken up by a loud alert on their phone, which was set to Do Not Disturb. The Amber Alert was about a missing child, but the kid was later found dead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're supposed to help find missing children quickly. The author is saying that the alert was sent too broadly, including to people who had their phones on DND, which might not be effective because those people are asleep and can't help. The author also mentions the context of their personal struggles, like being unemployed and their wife working hard.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if the alert disturbed people, it's for a good cause. But the author's point is that it's a Catch-22: if the alert works, people say it's good, but if it doesn't, they complain about the interruption. The author's complaint is about the system's overreach and inefficiency.\n\nThe key here is whether complaining about the alert's method is wrong, especially given the tragic outcome. The author didn't harm anyone by expressing their concern. They suggested improvements like not overriding DND or making alerts optional. People contacting authorities to give feedback is part of a democratic process to improve systems.\n\nMoreover, the author's frustration is understandable. Being woken up in the middle of the night for something they can't help with is reasonable to be upset about. The fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight, but the author's intention wasn't malicious. They just want a more effective and respectful alert system.\n\nSo, the answer is probably that the author isn't in the wrong (B). They're raising valid points about the system's flaws without dismissing the seriousness of the Amber Alert's purpose.\n"
