It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. So the situation is about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone, even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. The author complained on Facebook about how the alert was too broad and interrupted people who were trying to sleep. Then the child in the Amber Alert was found dead, and some people are now telling the author they're an asshole for complaining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. On one hand, Amber Alerts are meant to quickly disseminate information to help find abducted children. They are critical for public safety, and the system is designed to override normal phone settings to ensure maximum reach. The author is criticizing the system's broad approach, especially when it's late at night and people are asleep. They argue that not everyone in a 58-mile radius is going to be able to spot the car, and that the alert's disruption is unnecessary for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that the child was found dead might make people feel that any criticism of the Amber Alert system is insensitive. Those who support the author might say that their concern is about the system's effectiveness and the balance between public safety and personal privacy/interruption. Others might argue that when a child's life is at stake, the system's approach is justified regardless of individual inconvenience.\n\nThe author also mentions their personal situation\u2014unemployment, their wife being the sole breadwinner with a long commute, and their own children. This context might be used to show that their complaint was from a place of stress, but it doesn't necessarily excuse the complaint. The key question is whether complaining about the system's method is being an asshole or a valid critique.\n\nI should consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They are emergency alerts, and in emergencies, systems often have to prioritize speed and reach over individual preferences. However, the author's point about the system's one-size-fits-all approach might have merit. Maybe there's a need for more nuanced settings, like allowing users to opt-in or have exceptions for certain times. But the fact that the alert system overrides DND is by design to ensure people get the message, so the author's frustration is about that design choice.\n\nNow, the twist is the child's death. Critics might say that the author's complaint is callous because the alert was for a real emergency. But supporters might say that the author's issue is with the system's inefficiency, not the child's situation. The author even acknowledges the Catch-22 where if the child had been found alive, the same critics would praise the alert's effectiveness.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, is it wrong to question the system's method when it's meant for a good cause? Or is the author being insensitive by focusing on their inconvenience over a tragic outcome? The line between constructive criticism and insensitivity can be thin here.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that many people called the police to complain. If a lot of people have the same concern, it might indicate a systemic issue worth addressing. However, in the face of a tragic outcome, public opinion might turn against those who criticized the system, even if their critique is valid.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they're pointing out a potential flaw in the system's design. However, the context of the child's death complicates the situation, making their complaint seem less sensitive. But it's possible to be critical of the system without being an asshole, especially if the critique is about improving the system rather than dismissing the emergency.\n"
