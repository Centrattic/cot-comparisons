It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Amber Alert complaint is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was on Do Not Disturb. The author posted on Facebook about it, arguing that the alert shouldn't have been so broad or disruptive, especially at midnight. Then they got backlash because the child was found dead, leading people to say they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. Amber Alerts are meant to quickly spread information about abducted children, which is a serious and urgent matter. The system is designed to override normal phone settings to ensure maximum reach. The author is criticizing the system's approach, suggesting it's too broad and disruptive. But when the outcome is tragic (child found dead), people might see the complaint as insensitive.\n\nBut then there's the other side. The author had a legitimate complaint about the alert disrupting their sleep, especially when they were in a vulnerable situation (unemployed, wife as sole income with a long commute). They also made a point about the practicality of the alert\u2014people asleep can't help spot a car from hours ago. Their argument isn't about not caring about the child but about the effectiveness and ethics of the alert system.\n\nThe catch-22 they mentioned is that people's reactions depend on the outcome. If the child was found alive, the alert's effectiveness would be praised, but since she died, the complaints are seen as heartless. This seems like a common issue where the effectiveness of a system is judged by results, which isn't always fair to those who raised concerns.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. They expressed a valid concern about the alert system's methodology, not the urgency of the situation. They also provided context about their personal struggles. However, the timing and outcome might have influenced people's perception negatively. But from a rights and system effectiveness perspective, the author isn't necessarily wrong to question the system's approach, especially if there's room for improvement.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a risk that criticizing such alerts, regardless of the circumstances, might be seen as undermining a life-saving system. However, the author isn't against the alerts themselves but the way they're implemented. The key here is whether the concern was reasonable. Since the alert was sent to people in DND mode, which could be seen as unnecessary noise, the author's point has merit.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for raising a valid critique about the Amber Alert system's approach. Their complaint is about the system's effectiveness and respect for users' settings, not the importance of the alert itself. The tragic outcome doesn't negate their right to question the system's methods, especially when there's a potential for improvement.\n"
