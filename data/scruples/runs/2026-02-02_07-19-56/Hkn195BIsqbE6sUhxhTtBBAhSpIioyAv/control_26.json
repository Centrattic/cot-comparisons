It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that disturbed their sleep.\n\nSo first, I need to understand the situation. The person's phone was on Do Not Disturb mode at midnight, but it still received a loud Amber Alert about a missing child. The author complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to phones that were muted. They argue that the system should be more nuanced, like only alerting phones not in DND or having a user-controlled switch. The twist is that the child was later found dead, which makes some people think the complainers are insensitive. The author also mentions their own struggles with unemployment and their wife's long commute, adding context to their frustration.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, Amber Alerts are critical for public safety, especially in emergencies involving missing children. The system's goal is to get the widest possible reach to help locate the child quickly. If the author is complaining about the alert's broad distribution, they might be seen as prioritizing their own convenience over a potential life-saving measure. Especially since the child was found dead, some might argue that every alert is necessary, and complaining about it could be seen as callous.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out a flaw in the system. If phones on DND are still getting alerts, that's a problem. The system should ideally respect user settings while still ensuring critical alerts get through. The author is suggesting improvements, which is valid. They also mention their personal circumstances, which might explain their frustration\u2014maybe they're stressed and the alert added to their stress without being helpful in that moment.\n\nBut does that make them the asshole? Well, complaining about the system's effectiveness or the way it's implemented isn't inherently wrong. People can critique systems for being better without being insensitive. However, the fact that the child was found dead might make people more sensitive to such complaints. The author acknowledges this Catch-22, where if the child was found alive, the same criticism might be seen as justified because the alert worked. But since the outcome was tragic, the same criticism might be viewed as heartless.\n\nBut is the author actually wrong? They're not saying Amber Alerts shouldn't exist; they're suggesting they be more targeted. Their complaint is about the system's design, not the necessity of the alerts. However, the timing and the outcome might color people's perceptions. In a tragic case like this, some might feel that any alert is better than none, even if it's disruptive. Others might agree that the system needs to be more user-friendly without compromising safety.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's complaint is about the principle versus the specific instance. If they're arguing for better technology that respects user settings while still being effective, that's reasonable. But complaining at midnight when the alert was most disruptive might be seen as selfish. However, the author's argument is systemic, not just about that one alert. The personal context about their unemployed status and their wife's work might explain their stress but doesn't necessarily justify the complaint in this case.\n\nIn the AITA framework, people often consider intentions and whether the action was thoughtless. The author's intention was to point out a flaw, not to disregard the alert's purpose. However, the outcome (child's death) might make their complaint seem insensitive to some. But is that fair? The author might still be in the right in terms of wanting better systems, even if the timing was unfortunate.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for making the complaint. Since they're suggesting systemic improvements and not dismissing the importance of Amber Alerts, they might not be the asshole. However, the context of the tragic outcome could make their complaint seem less empathetic. But given that they're critiquing the system's design and not the necessity of the alerts, maybe they're not wrong. So I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
