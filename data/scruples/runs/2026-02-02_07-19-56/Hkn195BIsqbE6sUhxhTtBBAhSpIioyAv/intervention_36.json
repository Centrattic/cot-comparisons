It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after complaining about an Amber Alert. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in Do Not Disturb mode at midnight when their phone received an Amber Alert, which is a public safety alert for missing children. The alert was sent out to their phone even though it was set to DND. They posted on Facebook about it, arguing that the alert shouldn't have been so broad and shouldn't override their DND setting. They also mentioned their personal context\u2014unemployment, family responsibilities, and the fact that their wife was the main breadwinner. Then, there's the twist that the child in the Amber Alert was found dead, which complicates the situation. The author acknowledges it's a Catch-22 where people might be judged harshly if the child died, but if the child had been found alive, people would say the alert worked.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking another opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the balance between public safety and individual privacy/disruption. Amber Alerts are designed to mobilize the public to help find missing children quickly. The system's effectiveness relies on widespread dissemination. However, overriding Do Not Disturb settings might be seen as a privacy issue. The author's frustration is understandable, especially given their personal circumstances. But when a child's life is at risk, the priority is on acting swiftly. \n\nThe fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight. People might feel that the alert was necessary, even if it disturbed people. But the author's argument is that the alert wasn't effective in this case (since the child died), so the broad approach didn't help and caused unnecessary disruption. However, others might argue that even if this alert didn't save the child, the system is still crucial for other cases where it does work.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's complaint is about the system's design, suggesting that there should be a way to allow alerts without overriding DND settings. That's a valid technical critique. But in an emergency, the system's priority is to reach as many people as possible. So, is the author's frustration justified? Maybe, but the way they expressed it\u2014publicly complaining on Facebook and calling police\u2014might be seen as insensitive given the tragic outcome.\n\nBut the author also acknowledges the Catch-22, which shows they recognize the dilemma. They're not against Amber Alerts but want a more nuanced approach. So, are they in the wrong? It's tricky. If the system's purpose is to save lives, even if it's disruptive, then complaining publicly might seem harsh. However, the author's personal situation and the technical argument about alert design could support their stance. The key is whether the means (disturbing people) are justified by the ends (saving a child's life). In this case, since the child died, some might think the alert didn't work, making the disruption pointless. But the system's value isn't just in one case.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're raising a valid point about system design and personal impact, even if the emotional reaction is strong. So the answer is B.\n"
