It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this \"Am I the asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the author was in Do Not Disturb mode at midnight when they received an Amber Alert. They complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disturbing people who were asleep. The key points here are the timing (midnight) and the DND setting. The author argues that the alert system should be more nuanced, not overriding DND and targeting only those who opt in. They also mention their personal context of being unemployed, their wife being the sole provider with a long commute, and the fact that the alert was about a child abduction which later turned out to be a tragic outcome (the girl found dead). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're designed to quickly disseminate information about missing children, especially those who might be in danger. The system is supposed to interrupt normal alerts to get the message out to as many people as possible in the area. However, the author's main issue is about the system overriding DND, which is supposed to prevent disturbances. That's a valid privacy and noise concern, especially at such a late hour. \n\nBut there's a catch-22 here: if the alert had been successful in finding the child alive, the author's complaint might be seen as selfish. However, in this case, the child was found dead, which complicates the situation. The author's concern was about the system's methodology rather than the outcome. They're not opposed to Amber Alerts in general but think the implementation is flawed. \n\nThe personal context adds depth. The author mentions their wife's dedication to work and the stress of unemployment. This could explain why the alert at midnight disrupted their rest. However, the tragedy of the situation might lead some to believe that any criticism of the alert system is insensitive, given the outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's argument about the system's nuance is reasonable. People should have more control over receiving such alerts, perhaps with an opt-in option or different settings that respect DND. The system's effectiveness is key, but so is respecting user preferences to avoid unnecessary disturbances. \n\nThe challenge is balancing public good with individual rights. The author is not denying the importance of Amber Alerts but is pointing out a flaw in their delivery. The response from others (calling the police to complain) suggests that there's a community concern. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did voice a concern about a system that's meant to help in emergencies. But after the child was found dead, the criticism might be seen as trivializing the tragedy. However, the author isn't opposing the alert system; they're advocating for a better approach. The fact that the alert system is supposed to be urgent but also respects user settings is a point to consider. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's complaint is about the method, not the intent. They are not in the wrong for expressing that concern, even if the outcome is tragic. The system's design might need improvement, and the author's perspective is valid. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
