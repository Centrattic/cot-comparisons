It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for complaining about the Amber Alert. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the Amber Alert went off at midnight on a phone set to Do Not Disturb. The alert was about a child abduction, and the author complained on Facebook about it being disruptive and not targeted properly. They also mention that the girl was later found dead, which complicates things because people might say that complaining after a tragic outcome is insensitive.\n\nNow, the author's main points are that the alert shouldn't override DND settings and that the alert was sent too broadly, so people couldn't help anyway. They also reference their own situation of being unemployed and their wife's work stress, which adds context to their frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, Amber Alerts are meant to get urgent information out quickly. Even if the alert didn't lead to immediate help, the system's purpose is to increase the chances of finding the child. The fact that the girl was found dead might make people feel that any criticism is inappropriate because the outcome is tragic. But the author argues that complaining is valid because the system's method is flawed, not because the outcome is bad.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they did express a legitimate concern about the system's design, which could be true. However, they might come off as insensitive because they're focusing on the disruption caused rather than the urgency of the situation, especially after the child's death. But the author also points out the Catch-22 where people criticize alerts based on the outcome, which is a fair point. \n\nIn the end, while the author's complaints about the system's design issues are valid, the timing and context of the complaint, especially after a tragic outcome, could be seen as lacking empathy. However, the system's effectiveness isn't solely determined by this one incident. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out flaws, but they might have been tone-deaf in their expression.\n"
