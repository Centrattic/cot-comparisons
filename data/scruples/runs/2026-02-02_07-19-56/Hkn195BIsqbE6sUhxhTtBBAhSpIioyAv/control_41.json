It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone despite being on Do Not Disturb at midnight. They complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disruptive, especially to people who were asleep. Then they got called an asshole because the child was later found dead, leading to the Catch-22 argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Amber Alerts are designed to quickly disseminate information about missing children, especially in cases of abduction. The system is meant to reach as many people as possible to increase the chances of finding the child quickly. The author's complaint is about the alert being sent to phones on DND and at an inconvenient time. They argue that the tech should be more nuanced, not overriding DND settings.\n\nBut when the child is found dead, people might feel that any complaints about the alert are insensitive. The author is caught in a tough spot here. They're not denying the tragedy; they're pointing out the system's flaws. However, in the aftermath of such a tragedy, complaints might be seen as tone-deaf, even if the criticisms have merit.\n\nOn one hand, the author is raising a valid point about the system's effectiveness and user experience. If the alert isn't useful (like when people are asleep and can't help), maybe it's better to refine how it's delivered. On the other hand, in an emergency, the system's priority is to maximize reach regardless of inconvenience because every second counts. The tragedy might make people more defensive about the system's current approach, even if there are improvements to be made.\n\nThe author also mentions their personal situation\u2014unemployed, family responsibilities. This could add context to their frustration but might not directly affect the ethical judgment of their stance.\n\nThe Catch-22 they mention is that if the alert saved a life, people would praise it, but if it didn't, they're criticized for complaining. That seems like a weak argument against their position, but it's a common reaction in high-emotion issues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not malicious; they want the system to be better. But in the context of a tragic outcome, their complaints might be perceived as insensitive. However, the debate over policy and effectiveness isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether their criticism is valid regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn ethical terms, it's about balancing public safety with individual privacy and convenience. The author isn't against Amber Alerts but wants them to be smarter. They aren't ignoring the severity of the situation but are pointing out a flaw in the system. So, while their complaints might be unpopular after the tragedy, they're not factually wrong in their analysis. The system may need refinement, and their feedback is a part of that process.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're raising a legitimate critique of a system's design, even if it's in the context of a tragic event.\n"
