It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an Amber Alert going off on a phone that was set to Do Not Disturb. The person is complaining that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially at midnight when people are asleep. They argue that the system overrides their phone settings and that people who are asleep can't help spot a car from five hours ago. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. These alerts are meant to quickly disseminate information about a missing child, especially in cases of abduction. The priority is to get as many people as possible to look out for the child, which could be critical in locating them quickly. The person who wrote this does acknowledge that they wouldn't want harm to come to their own kids, so they're not indifferent to the issue.\n\nBut the problem here is the method of delivery. The phone was on Do Not Disturb, which the user set intentionally to avoid disturbances. The alert overrides that setting, which could be frustrating because it disrupts their rest. The person is raising a valid point about the system's effectiveness. If the alert goes off when people are asleep, they can't actually help. So maybe there's a flaw in how these alerts are distributed.\n\nThe author also mentions that the girl was found dead later. This complicates the situation because some might argue that complaining about the alert in such a tragic case is insensitive. However, the author's argument isn't against the need for Amber Alerts but about their implementation. They suggest that there should be better targeting or options to respect Do Not Disturb settings. \n\nNow, the question is whether complaining about the system's flaws is being an asshole. The author is pointing out a practical issue that could reduce the effectiveness of the alert if people are disturbed and then annoyed, leading them to disable alerts in the future. However, others might feel that in a life-threatening situation, the system's priority is justified, even if it's inconvenient.\n\nAlso, considering the author's personal situation\u2014unemployed, thinking about their wife's long commute, and their own kids\u2014it shows they have empathy and are not dismissing the severity of the case. But the argument is more about the system's design. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on perspective. If the argument is about the system's effectiveness versus individual disruption, there's merit in both sides. The key is whether the complaint is valid or if it's inconsiderate. Since the author is suggesting improvements (like a software switch) and not dismissing the alert's purpose, they're not in the wrong. They're pointing out a flaw that could be addressed to make the system better. The fact that the girl was found dead later doesn't negate the validity of the system's design issues. It's a tragic outcome, but the complaint was about the alert's delivery method, not the case itself. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're raising a reasonable concern about the system's design, and it's okay to critique systems for improvement, even in serious situations.\n"
