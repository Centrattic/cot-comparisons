It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. The author complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disruptive, especially since they were asleep. They also mention their personal struggles with unemployment and their wife's work situation. Then, the twist is that the child in the Amber Alert was found dead, which makes people question if the author is an asshole for complaining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Amber Alerts are designed for emergencies to help locate missing children. The system's priority is to maximize reach to ensure the public can help. However, the author is pointing out a potential flaw in the system\u2014alerts overriding DND settings and being sent to people far from the incident. The author's complaint is about the system's effectiveness and respect for user preferences. \n\nBut then the child was found dead. This might lead some to think that the author's complaint is insensitive because the alert's purpose was to save a life, which failed in this case. However, the author's argument isn't against Amber Alerts in general but about their implementation. They suggest improvements like targeting alerts more precisely and respecting DND settings unless there's a way for users to opt-in. Their personal context adds that they were in a vulnerable situation, which might influence their reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did they act unethically by complaining, and is their criticism valid? Criticizing a system that has flaws isn't inherently wrong. People often point out issues to improve systems. The author isn't downplaying the tragedy but is concerned about the system's effectiveness and user experience. However, in the context of a dead child, some might see the complaint as tone-deaf, especially if others feel the alert's disruption was necessary despite the inconvenience.\n\nBut the author also mentions that many others called the police to complain, implying a broader concern. The system's effectiveness is debatable\u2014if the alert didn't help find the child alive, maybe the system needs adjustment. The author's stance is about balance between public safety and personal privacy/alert fatigue. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it's subjective. The author isn't malicious but is expressing a valid critique. However, the emotional weight of the situation (a dead child) might make their complaint seem less considerate. Still, the AITA format often looks at intent and reasonableness. The author's intent was to point out a flaw, not to disrespect the victim. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their criticism is constructive and not malicious, even if it's seen as insensitive by some."
