It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off during their Do Not Disturb time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The Amber Alert was sent out at midnight when the author had their phone on Do Not Disturb. The alert was loud and interrupted their sleep. They posted on Facebook about how the alert was unnecessarily broad and shouldn't override DND settings. They also mention personal context about their unemployed status and their wife's responsibilities. Then they add that the child was found dead, which complicates things because some people might think complaining after a tragedy is insensitive.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to express their opinion versus the sensitivity of the situation. On one hand, Amber Alerts are critical for public safety and locating missing children. Being woken up suddenly could be stressful, but it's a small price to pay if it helps save a life. However, the author's complaint is about the system's design\u2014why override DND? They suggest technical solutions, which might be valid. \n\nBut the twist is that the child was found dead afterward. Some might argue that in such a tragic outcome, complaining about the alert's timing is insensitive. Yet, others might counter that the author's feedback is about improving the system to prevent future unnecessary disturbances, especially if the alert's reach is too broad. Also, the author's personal situation (unemployment, family stress) could add context to their frustration.\n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole (in the wrong) for their complaint. The \"Am I the Asshole?\" format usually balances empathy and reason. While the author's concern for the system's effectiveness is valid, timing the complaint after a tragic outcome might be seen as insensitive. However, their intent wasn't to downplay the tragedy but to critique the system's approach. They also acknowledge that if the child had been found alive, people would praise the alert's success, which shows they understand the system's purpose.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the system's purpose vs. individual disruption, the author's valid technical critique, and the emotional impact of the tragedy. The answer hinges on whether expressing a critique is wrong despite the outcome. In many AITA scenarios, expressing an opinion, even if it's seen as tone-deaf, isn't considered the \"asshole\" position if the intent is constructive. The author's feedback could lead to better system design, which is a positive outcome. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
