It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's phone was on Do Not Disturb, but it still went off at midnight with an Amber Alert. The alert was about a missing child. The author complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and interrupting people who were asleep. They suggested better tech solutions, like respecting DND settings or having a manual switch. Then the child was found dead, and the author is now questioning if they're an asshole for complaining, since the kid didn't survive.\n\nSo the key points here are the author's complaint about the Amber Alert system's methodology and the outcome of the case. The author is arguing that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to people who had their phones on silent. They also mention the tech should have more nuance. Then, because the child died, they're being told they must be wrong for complaining.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider ethics here. On one hand, Amber Alerts are meant to save lives by quickly spreading information about a missing child. The system is designed to override normal notifications because the urgency is high. On the other hand, the author is making a valid point about the system's effectiveness and intrusiveness. Just because someone is asleep doesn't mean they can't help, but it's also true that interrupting sleep might not be the most effective use of resources. \n\nThe author isn't denying the severity of the situation; they're critiquing the method. They even acknowledge that if the child had been found alive, people would say the alert worked. However, after the tragic outcome, their criticism is seen as insensitive. But does that make them the asshole?\n\nAlso, the author mentions their own personal struggles, like unemployment and their wife's job, which adds context about their stress levels. But that might not be directly relevant to whether their complaint is valid.\n\nThe key is whether it's reasonable to question the system's effectiveness. Even in a tragic case, questioning the methodology isn't inherently wrong. However, the timing and the outcome might make their complaint seem insensitive. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's important to balance the need for urgent alerts with respecting individuals' settings. The author's suggestion for better tech solutions isn't malicious. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for voicing a technical critique, even if the outcome is tragic.\n"
