It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off at midnight despite their phone being in Do Not Disturb mode. The author complained on Facebook about the alert's broad reach and disruption. They argue that the system shouldn't override DND and that people asleep can't help find the child. Then, the child was found dead, leading others to accuse them of being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Amber Alerts are designed to quickly spread information about missing children, which is a critical public safety measure. However, the way it was delivered in this case\u2014midnight, full volume, overriding DND\u2014could be problematic. The author's complaint is about the system's overreach and potential inefficiency, which is a valid technical or policy concern.\n\nBut the twist is that the child was found dead. This might make people more sensitive to complaints about the alert. However, the author's argument isn't about not caring; they do mention their children and the situation. They're more focused on the system's flaws. \n\nThe challenge is balancing public safety with individual rights. Even if the alert didn't help in this case, the system's existence is for when it does help. The author's complaint is about the method, not the intent. Are they in the wrong for pointing out a flaw? Or is the system's necessity overriding their inconvenience?\n\nAlso, many people called police to complain. That suggests a broader concern. But after the tragic outcome, the public might feel differently. The author's stance might be seen as insensitive because the alert was in response to a real emergency. Yet, the system's effectiveness could be questioned if it's too disruptive without proper targeting.\n\nIn ethical terms, the intent matters. The author's intent was to highlight a systemic issue, not to disregard the child's safety. Their argument is about improving the system. However, the timing and the aftermath (child found dead) could make their complaints seem callous, even if unintentionally. \n\nBut is that fair? People have the right to criticize systems that affect their lives, even in sensitive situations. The key is whether the criticism is constructive. The author suggests alternatives like a software switch, which is constructive. \n\nSo, while the alert was meant to serve a vital purpose, the author's complaints are about how it's implemented. It's a policy critique, not a disregard for the child's safety. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. However, the public might feel differently given the tragic outcome, but ethically, having a concern about the system's disruption isn't inherently wrong.\n"
