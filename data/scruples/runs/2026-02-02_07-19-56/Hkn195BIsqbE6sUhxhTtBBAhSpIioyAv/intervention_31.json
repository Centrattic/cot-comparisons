It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that was sent at midnight to their phone, which was on Do Not Disturb.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how Amber Alerts work. They are emergency alerts sent to phones to inform people about missing children. The system is designed to maximize reach, so even if a phone is on Do Not Disturb, the alert overrides that to ensure people get the message. The goal is to get as many people as possible to help locate the child quickly.\n\nThe author complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to phones in Do Not Disturb mode at midnight. Their argument is that people asleep and with phones muted are not in a position to help. Additionally, they mentioned their personal situation\u2014unemployed, wife's job, kids\u2014so they were feeling stressed and the alert was disruptive.\n\nNow, the twist: the child was found dead later. So the author is questioning if complaining about the alert makes them an asshole since the child died. They also note the Catch-22 where if the child had been found alive, the same complaints might be seen as valid because the alert worked.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. \n\nTo decide if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the intent and impact. The system's design is to override DND for emergencies. The author's complaint is about the system's approach, which is meant to save lives. However, the author is also pointing out a potential flaw: interrupting people when they can't help. But in emergencies, the priority is urgent action, even if it's disruptive.\n\nThe emotional aspect is tricky. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with their personal circumstances. But the system's purpose is life-saving, so complaints might be seen as insensitive in the context of a tragedy. The author's acknowledgment of the Catch-22 shows they understand the dilemma, but their public complaint might be seen as prioritizing their convenience over the emergency's urgency.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about intent and proportionality. The author isn't malicious; they're highlighting a system issue. However, in the context of a child's death, the complaint might appear callous. But maybe the system needs feedback for improvement. Still, the immediate reaction in the wake of such a tragedy could be seen as lacking empathy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The system's design is intentional, and the author's criticism is valid in terms of system efficiency. However, their public complaint at that moment, knowing the alert was about a missing child, could be seen as insensitive. The answer might depend on whether the criticism was constructive vs. merely complaining without empathy.\n"
