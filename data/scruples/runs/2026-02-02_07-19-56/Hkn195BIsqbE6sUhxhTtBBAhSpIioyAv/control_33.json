It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on a phone set to Do Not Disturb. The author complained about it on Facebook, saying it shouldn't have been sent so broadly and that overriding DND was inappropriate. Then the child found dead, which complicates things because people might think complaining about the alert makes you an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The Amber Alert system is designed to help locate missing children quickly. The author's concern is about the alert's broad dissemination and disruption during sleep. But after the tragic outcome, does that make the author's complaint unjustifiable?\n\nI should evaluate the author's reasoning. They argue that the tech shouldn't override DND, suggesting alternatives like a software switch. Their context includes personal struggles and family responsibilities, which might add to their sensitivity about being disturbed. However, the system's purpose is urgent and life-saving, even if the alert didn't result in finding the child alive.\n\nBut does the author's complaint show insensitivity? They acknowledge the tragedy but point out the Catch-22 of the situation. The key is whether their criticism is valid. The system's design might not account for DND settings, which could be a flaw. The author's right to voice concerns about public safety systems should be considered. However, after the child's death, some might view complaining as heartless, even if the argument has merit.\n\nI need to balance the intent of the Amber Alert system with the user's rights. The author's intention was to improve the system, but the timing and context (midnight, DND) could be seen as a legitimate inconvenience. The fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight, making people less sympathetic to complaints. However, the author's argument isn't about not caring but about the system's effectiveness and respect for user settings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance isn't about ignoring the tragedy but about the system's approach. Their criticism is about improving the system's nuance, which is a valid point regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that in such a tragic case, any complaint is inappropriate. However, the ethical position here is that the author's concern is valid, and they are not the asshole for pointing out potential flaws in the system, even if it's after the fact.\n"
