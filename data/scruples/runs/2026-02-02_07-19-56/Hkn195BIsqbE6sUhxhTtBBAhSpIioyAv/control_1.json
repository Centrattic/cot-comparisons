It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. They complained about it on Facebook, arguing that the alert shouldn't override their DND setting, especially at midnight when people are asleep. They also mention their personal context: unemployed, wife is the sole breadwinner with a long commute, and they have kids. Then, the twist is the child in the Amber Alert was found dead, which complicates the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Amber Alerts are designed to quickly spread information about abducted children, which is a critical public safety issue. The system's priority is to maximize the chance of finding the child alive by reaching as many people as possible. However, the user's complaint is about the disruption caused by the alert overriding their DND setting. They argue that people who are asleep aren't in a position to help identify a car from hours ago and miles away.\n\nThe user's stance is that the technology should be more nuanced. They suggest that alerts shouldn't override DND, or at least have a software switch. Their argument is that those who can actually help are the ones who might have their phones active. But given the urgency of Amber Alerts, the system is set up to reach everyone possible, regardless of their phone settings. \n\nThe author also mentions that many others complained to the police, which might indicate a broader dissatisfaction with the alert system. However, the tragic outcome of the child being found dead adds emotional weight. Some might argue that complaining after the fact is insensitive, given the child's death. Yet, the user also points out the Catch-22: if the alert had worked (child found alive), the complaints would be seen as valid, but since the child died, the complaints are dismissed as insensitive.\n\nNow, considering the user's personal situation: unemployed, wife's job stress, and their own children. This context might explain their frustration, but does it justify their complaint? The key here is whether complaining about the alert system is inherently wrong when it's designed for a life-saving purpose. \n\nOn one hand, the user has a valid technical critique about the system's effectiveness and user experience. On the other hand, the system's design prioritizes reaching as many people as possible, which might be necessary even if it causes inconvenience. However, the user isn't arguing against the alert's purpose but rather its implementation. They want a more thoughtful approach, which could be a reasonable technical discussion.\n\nThe fact that many others also complained suggests that there's a genuine issue with how the alerts are triggered and delivered. The user's frustration is compounded by their personal circumstances, but the core issue is about the system's design. \n\nThe twist about the child's death adds emotional complexity. Some might view the complaints as heartless, but the user isn't opposing the alert's purpose; they're advocating for a better system. The Catch-22 they mention highlights how the effectiveness of alerts can be judged only by outcomes, which are beyond anyone's control.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're raising a legitimate concern about the balance between public safety alerts and individual privacy/quiet times. Their personal context adds to their stress but isn't a justification for insensitivity. The system's design flaws are a valid point for discussion, especially if it deters people from using DND features, which are important for mental health and rest. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
