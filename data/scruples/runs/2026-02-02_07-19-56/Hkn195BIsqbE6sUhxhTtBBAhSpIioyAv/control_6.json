It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong after complaining about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was on Do Not Disturb. The alert was about a child abduction, and the girl was later found dead. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for complaining, especially since the alert was meant to help find a missing child.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The Amber Alert system is designed to quickly spread information about abducted children, relying on the public's attention. But the alert went off at midnight on a phone set to DND, which the user argues is ineffective because people are asleep and can't help. They also mention the context of their personal stress, like unemployment and their wife's work situation, which might add to their frustration.\n\nThe key issue here seems to be whether the author's complaint is valid despite the tragic outcome. On one hand, the alert's purpose is critical\u2014saving a child's life. On the other, the method of delivery might not be optimal. The author is suggesting that the system should be more nuanced, respecting user preferences like DND settings but still allowing emergency alerts. \n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author isn't denying the severity of the situation; they're just questioning the effectiveness and timing of the alert. The fact that the child was found dead might make some people think the author is heartless for complaining. But others might agree that the system needs improvement to avoid disturbing people unnecessarily, which could lead to better public cooperation in the long run.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that many people called to complain, which suggests a broader concern. The author's main point is about the system's implementation rather than dismissing the importance of Amber Alerts. So, while the situation is tragic, the author's criticism is about improving the system's effectiveness, not being indifferent to the child's safety. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their complaint is about practical improvements rather than a lack of empathy.\n"
