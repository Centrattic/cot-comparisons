It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe person wrote a post about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their phone, which was set to Do Not Disturb. They were upset that the alert bypassed the DND setting and woke them up. They argued that the system shouldn't override DND and should be more nuanced. They also mentioned their personal struggles with unemployment and their wife's work situation. Then they added that the child in the Amber Alert was found dead, which complicates the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They are designed to quickly disseminate information about abducted children to the public to aid in their recovery. The system is prioritized for emergencies, so overriding DND makes sense because in an emergency, you want as many people as possible to be alerted immediately. However, the author is frustrated that their phone's settings were ignored, which affected their rest and possibly their family's plans.\n\nThe author's complaint is about the system's design. They think there should be a way to opt out or have more control, like a switch for emergency alerts. That's a valid technical critique. But the emotional aspect is tricky because the alert was about a real case, and the child was found dead. People might see the author as insensitive for complaining, especially since the outcome is tragic.\n\nBut the author also explains their reasoning, pointing out that the alert was sent to a large area, including people far from where the event occurred. They argue that such people are unlikely to help spot a car 58 miles away. That's a logical point. However, the system's purpose is to cast a wide net, so even if some people aren't in the immediate area, the chance that someone might see the vehicle is considered worth the inconvenience.\n\nThe author's personal context adds nuance. They mention their unemployment and their wife's long commute, which might make the disruption more significant for them. But others might still feel that the alert's importance overrides personal inconvenience.\n\nThe twist is that the child was found dead. This could make people feel like the author's complaint is callous, given the tragic outcome. However, the author argues that if the child had been found alive, the same people would praise the alert system. This suggests a double standard based on the outcome, which is a common issue in such debates.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a balance between public safety and individual rights. The author is voicing a legitimate concern about the system's effectiveness and intrusiveness. But they might be seen as insensitive because they were complaining after a tragic outcome. However, their technical critique is valid and not inherently wrong. People can acknowledge the tragedy while still thinking the system could be improved.\n\nI think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong because they are raising a valid point about the system's design and its impact on individuals, even if others might find their complaint insensitive given the outcome. It's a complex situation where both the system's purpose and individual rights are at play.\n"
