It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone set to Do Not Disturb at midnight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Amber Alerts are designed to quickly disseminate information about missing children, which is a critical public safety issue. The alert in question was sent out broadly, including to people whose phones were on DND. The author is upset because being woken up at midnight might not be the best way to get help finding a child, especially since the location was far away. They also mention their personal struggles and the context of their family situation, which adds emotional weight to their complaint.\n\nOn the other hand, the alert was for a missing child who was later found dead. This complicates things because it raises the question of whether the alert was essential, even if it disturbed people. Some might argue that in such a critical situation, the alert should be prioritized over individual inconvenience. Others might say that the system should be more nuanced, respecting DND settings or using smarter targeting to avoid unnecessary disturbances.\n\nThe author's arguments include practical points about the alert's effectiveness. If people are asleep and disturbed, they might not be in a position to help. Plus, if the child was found dead, some might say the alert's timing or method is under scrutiny. However, the author also acknowledges the Catch-22: if the child had been found alive, the same complaints might be dismissed as the alert being successful.\n\nI should also consider the broader implications. Amber Alerts rely on public awareness. If too many people are annoyed and ignore alerts, it could reduce their effectiveness in the future. But if the system is too intrusive, it might lead to complaints and decreased trust.\n\nThe author's personal circumstances\u2014unemployment, family responsibilities\u2014might make their reaction more understandable. They\u2019re not just being selfish; they\u2019re expressing frustration about a system that affects their personal life during a stressful time.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a balance between individual rights and community safety. The author is voicing a legitimate concern about the system's design. However, the fact that the child was found dead might make some people feel that the alert was necessary, no matter the disturbance. But others might agree that the system needs improvement to avoid over-notify people unnecessarily.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They have valid points about the alert's broad dissemination and timing, but the urgency of the situation complicates the issue. I think the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong (B), because they're raising a reasonable critique of the system's flaws, even if their perspective is influenced by personal context. However, this isn't a clear-cut yes or no\u2014it's more about acknowledging both sides. But since the options are A or B, I'll go with B, as the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having that opinion.\n"
