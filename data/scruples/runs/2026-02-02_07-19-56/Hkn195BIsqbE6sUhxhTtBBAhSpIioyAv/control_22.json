It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was on Do Not Disturb. The situation is that the Amber Alert was sent out at midnight, waking people up, and the person is upset that their phone's DND wasn't respected. They posted this on Facebook and are now questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They are designed to quickly disseminate information about abducted children, potentially saving lives. The system overrides normal notifications because the urgency is high. However, the author is arguing that the system should be smarter, like not overriding DND or having optional settings. Their complaint is about the disruption caused, especially at midnight when people are asleep, and they feel helpless to help even if they hear the alert.\n\nThe author also mentions their personal situation\u2014unemployment, their wife's long commute, and kids at home. This context might explain their stress and sensitivity to the alert. But the twist is that the child was found dead, which complicates the situation. Some might say that complaining after such an outcome is insensitive, hence the \"asshole\" label. However, the author argues it's a Catch-22 where people would support the alert if the child was found but criticize the disruption if they weren't.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, Amber Alerts are crucial for public safety, and the system is set up to maximize reach. Even if it's disruptive, the priority is saving lives. The author's frustration about the system's lack of nuance is valid, but does that make them an asshole? Or is it a reasonable critique of the technology?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's complaint isn't about not helping but about the method. They acknowledge the importance of Amber Alerts but think the system could be improved. The fact that they also contacted the police to complain shows they tried to address it constructively. The personal context adds that their stress might have made the disruption more impactful.\n\nThe key here is balancing public safety with individual privacy and disruption. The author isn't against Amber Alerts but wants a better implementation. The question is whether their frustration is justified. In my view, the author isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for a more effective system rather than dismissing the alerts entirely. They're pointing out a flaw, not being indifferent to the child's safety. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
