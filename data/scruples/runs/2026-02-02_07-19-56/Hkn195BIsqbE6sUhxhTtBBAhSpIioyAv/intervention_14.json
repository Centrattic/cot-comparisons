It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone despite being on Do Not Disturb. The author complained about the alert being too broad, especially disturbing people who were asleep. Then the child was found dead, leading to the question of whether the author is an asshole for complaining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're designed for emergencies where a child is abducted and in immediate danger. The idea is to get the public's help in finding the child quickly. So, if an Amber Alert is issued, the priority is to alert as many people as possible because time is critical. \n\nThe author's complaint is about the broad distribution and the disruption caused. But when a child's life is at stake, the system's design is to prioritize the child's safety over individual inconvenience. Even if the alert was sent to people with DND on, the rationale is that any chance of someone seeing the vehicle and helping could be crucial. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is understandable. Being woken up in the middle of the night can be stressful, especially for someone in a vulnerable situation like unemployment and family responsibilities. But the key point here is the tragic outcome of the child being found dead. In such cases, there's often public sentiment that complaints about the alert are insensitive, especially when the alert didn't prevent the tragedy. \n\nBut I should also think about the system's effectiveness. If the alert system isn't reaching people, maybe there's a flaw. However, the system is a balance between overuse and underuse. If people start ignoring alerts because they're too frequent, it could reduce their effectiveness when they really matter. The author's suggestion for a software switch might be a reasonable technical solution, but that's separate from whether they were wrong to voice their complaint.\n\nThe fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight. Some might view the complaint as callous, but others might argue that the system's flaws should still be discussed. The author's intention wasn't to downplay the tragedy but to question the alert's methodology. \n\nStill, in the context of a tragic outcome, there's a social expectation that people will refrain from complaining about systems designed to prevent such tragedies. Even if the system isn't perfect, the author's public criticism might be seen as insensitive, especially after the fact. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're pointing out a systemic issue. However, the way they expressed it could come off as dismissive of the emergency's urgency. The line between constructive criticism and insensitivity might be thin here. \n\nConsidering all that, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A), as their complaint could be perceived as disregarding the critical nature of the Amber Alert system, especially after the tragic outcome. However, there's a counter-argument that the system could be improved, so maybe they're not entirely wrong. But given the emotional context and public sentiment, A seems like the answer.\n"
