It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that woke them up at midnight despite their phone being on Do Not Disturb. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's phone was on DND, which they set deliberately. Then an Amber Alert came through at midnight, which is a high-priority emergency alert. The author complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disruptive. Others might argue that the alert is crucial for public safety, especially when a child is missing. However, the author points out that people who are asleep might not be in a position to help and that there's a lack of nuance in how alerts are sent.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the Amber Alert system's purpose is to quickly disseminate information to maximize the chances of finding a missing child. 2) The author is upset about being disturbed at midnight when their phone was on DND. 3) The tragic outcome (the child found dead) adds emotional weight to the situation. \n\nThe author's argument is about the balance between public safety and individual privacy/interruption. They suggest that there should be a way to allow people to opt out of emergency alerts without having to turn off all notifications, which is a valid technical point. However, others might see the Amber Alert as a necessary intrusion for the greater good. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's complaint is about a system that overrides personal settings for a critical emergency. On the other, the alert system is designed to reach as many people as possible, regardless of their phone settings, because the situation is urgent. \n\nThe tragic outcome of the case (the child found dead) might make people more sympathetic to the alert system's importance. However, the author's frustration about being disturbed at midnight is also valid, especially considering their personal situation (unemployed, wife's job, etc.). \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, public safety is a collective responsibility. Emergency alerts are designed to override normal interruptions because the urgency is higher. The author's complaint could be seen as prioritizing personal convenience over a potential life-saving measure. However, the author is also raising a practical issue about the system's effectiveness\u2014alerting people who are asleep and unlikely to help might dilute the alert's impact. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the complaint is considered selfish given the context of a missing child. The author's concern about system improvements (like a toggle for emergency alerts) is reasonable, but the way they expressed their frustration publicly might come off as callous. \n\nGiven that the child was found dead, the situation is more sensitive. People might be less forgiving of complaints about the alert system in such a tragic outcome. However, the author's technical critique isn't inherently wrong; they're pointing out a flaw in the system. The problem is the tone and timing of their complaint. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer is nuanced. They're not necessarily a jerk for pointing out a system flaw, but their public complaint at a time of high emotional distress might be seen as insensitive. The author's stance is partially valid, but the way they expressed it could be considered inappropriate given the circumstances.\n"
