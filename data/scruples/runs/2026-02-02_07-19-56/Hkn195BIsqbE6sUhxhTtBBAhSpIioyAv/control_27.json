It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their Do Not Disturb phone. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The Amber Alert system is designed to quickly disseminate information about child abductions to help in their recovery. The person in the question was asleep with their phone on DND when they received an alert. They complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disruptive, especially when people are asleep and unable to help. They also mention their personal context of unemployment and family responsibilities. Then they add that the girl was found dead, which complicates the situation because some people might argue that complaining after such a tragic outcome is insensitive.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: \n\n1. **Purpose of Amber Alerts**: They are urgent public safety notifications. The system's design is to alert as many people as possible in the hope that someone might spot the missing child. The alerts are designed to override normal settings because the urgency is high.\n\n2. **Complaining about the Alert**: The person is upset because the alert was disruptive. They argue that it shouldn't override DND settings or that there should be more nuance. This is a valid technical and policy critique. However, the emotional response might be seen as less valid after the tragic outcome.\n\n3. **Timing and Context**: The person mentions their personal struggles, which adds context to their frustration. They might have been stressed about their unemployed status and their wife's long commute. This could influence their reaction to the alert.\n\n4. **Outcome of the Alert**: The girl was found dead, which changes the perspective. Some might see the complaint as heartless given the tragic result. However, the person also points out the Catch-22: if the girl had been found alive, supporters would say the alert worked, but if she was found dead, they'd say complaining is wrong. This could indicate a critique of the system's effectiveness regardless of the outcome.\n\n5. **Public Reaction**: The person called police to complain, which might be seen as counterproductive. However, public feedback is part of how systems improve. The question is whether their complaint is valid or if they're being inconsiderate.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Amber Alerts are mandated by law in the US, and there are federal regulations about how they are deployed. Complaining about their implementation is a civic right, but the appropriateness of the complaint might depend on the context. The system is designed to prioritize alerts over individual phone settings because the public safety need is considered more critical than temporary inconvenience.\n\nHowever, the user's complaint is about the system's design. They're not against the alerts themselves but the lack of nuance in how they're delivered. This is a technical critique, which is reasonable. The problem arises when the critique is made in public (like on Facebook) and could be seen as dismissive of the alert's purpose, especially after a tragic outcome.\n\nThe personal context of unemployment and family stress might make the user more sensitive to disruptions. However, the public nature of the complaint and the timing (after a death) could be seen as insensitive, even if the underlying critique is valid.\n\nIn conclusion, while the technical critique has merit, the public complaint after the tragedy might come across as inconsiderate. The user's stance isn't entirely in the wrong because they're pointing out a flaw in the system, but the way and timing of the complaint could make them the \"asshole\" in the eyes of some. However, the answer might hinge on whether the system's design is reasonable and if the user's complaint is a justified critique versus a selfish reaction.\n"
