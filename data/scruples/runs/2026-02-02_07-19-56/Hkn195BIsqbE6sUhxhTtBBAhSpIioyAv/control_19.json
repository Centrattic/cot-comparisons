It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that was sent at midnight, overriding the Do Not Disturb setting, which annoyed the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're designed to quickly disseminate information about abducted children, relying on the public's ability to recognize and report sightings. Given that the alert was about a child abduction, the system's priority is to reach as many people as possible, even if it means disrupting sleep. The author's complaint is about the alert being too broad and disturbing people who had their phones on DND. But when a child's life is at risk, the usual norms about quiet hours might be less important.\n\nThen there's the context that the child was found dead. This complicates the situation because some might argue that complaining about the alert is insensitive given the tragic outcome. However, the author's concerns about the alert system's effectiveness and intrusiveness are still valid. The issue here isn't just about the specific incident but the broader policy of how Amber Alerts are managed. The author suggests that the system should have more nuance, like respecting DND settings unless a user opt-in for such alerts. That's a technical and policy discussion, not necessarily a personal attack.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their personal struggles, like unemployment and family responsibilities. While this adds context to their frustration, it doesn't excuse complaining, but it does humanize their perspective. The key here is whether the complaint itself is reasonable. The author isn't opposing Amber Alerts in general but is critical of how they're implemented, especially the override of user settings. This is a legitimate critique of the system's design rather than a callous reaction to the situation.\n\nThe fact that the child was found dead might lead some to label the complainers as insensitive, but that's a fallacy. The effectiveness of Amber Alerts isn't proven by this single outcome. The author's point about the Catch-22\u2014where people's reactions depend on the outcome\u2014is valid. If the alert had led to the child being found alive, the same people might praise the system. This shows that the criticism is about the system's methodology, not the tragedy itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for raising valid concerns about the Amber Alert system's implementation. Their frustration is understandable, and their suggestions for improvement are reasonable. The tragic outcome doesn't negate the need for a more thoughtful approach to public alerts. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
