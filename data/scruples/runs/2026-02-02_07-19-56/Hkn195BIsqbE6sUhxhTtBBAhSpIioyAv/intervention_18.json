It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person had their phone on Do Not Disturb mode, and at midnight, it loudly alerted them about an Amber Alert. They complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to phones in DND mode. Their main points were that the tech shouldn't override DND, and that people asleep aren't helpful in spotting a car from hours ago. The twist is that the child in the alert was later found dead, leading others to accuse the complainers of being callous.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is voicing a reasonable concern about the system's overreach. Amber Alerts are meant to be urgent, but if they're not respecting user settings like DND, that's a problem. The author is suggesting a more nuanced approach, like only alerting phones that aren't silenced or having a switch for alerts. This seems like a valid technical critique.\n\nHowever, the emotional angle is strong here. The Amber Alert is about a missing child, and people might feel that any complaint in such a situation is insensitive, especially after the tragic outcome. The author's defense mentions their personal struggles and family context, which adds some nuance. They weren't just complaining for the sake of it but were in a stressful period themselves.\n\nThe key here is balancing individual rights and public safety. The author's complaint is about the system's effectiveness and user experience, not about not caring about the child. But the public might see their complaint as dismissive of the alert's purpose. The fact that the child was found dead complicates things because the tragedy makes people more sensitive to any criticism.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't advocating against Amber Alerts but pointing out a flaw in their implementation. They acknowledge the importance of the alerts but argue for better design. However, the timing of the complaint, immediately after the alert (before the child was found dead), and the follow-up about the child's death leading others to say the complainers are heartless, raises questions. The author might be seen as prioritizing their own convenience over the urgency of the situation, even if their point is technically valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They have a valid technical argument but may have come across as insensitive. However, they didn't ignore the alert's purpose. The answer hinges on whether the criticism is constructive or inconsiderate. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I see merit in both perspectives, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because their complaint is about improving the system rather than dismissing the alert's importance.\n"
