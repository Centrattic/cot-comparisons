It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. They complained on Facebook, arguing that the alert shouldn't override DND settings and that it's disruptive. Then the kid was found dead, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author is upset about being disturbed at midnight with a loud alert. They have valid points about the alert system possibly being too broad and not respecting user settings. They also mention their personal situation\u2014unemployed, wife as the main earner with a long commute, kids. So they're stressed and probably not in the best place mentally.\n\nThen there's the twist where the child was found dead. That's a tragic event. The author acknowledges the Catch-22: if the child was alive, people would say the alert worked, but now that she's dead, they're called insensitive for complaining. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's complaint was inappropriate. Amber Alerts are meant for emergencies, so their purpose is critical. However, the system's method of delivery (overriding DND) might be problematic. The author isn't denying the severity of the situation but is pointing out a flaw in the alert system. They also mention wanting to help but being in a position where they can't contribute effectively at midnight.\n\nThe key here is balancing the urgency of the alert against respecting user preferences. The author's criticism is about the system's design, not the situation itself. They\u2019re not dismissing the importance of the Amber Alert but suggesting improvements. Given that many others also called the police to complain, it's a common concern.\n\nThe fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight, but the author's initial stance was about the system's flaws. It's possible that their complaint was valid, and the system does need refinement. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're highlighting necessary improvements, not being insensitive.\n"
