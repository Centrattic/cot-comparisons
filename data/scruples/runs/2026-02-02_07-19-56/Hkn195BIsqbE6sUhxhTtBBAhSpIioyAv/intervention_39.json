It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their phone, which was set to Do Not Disturb. The alert was about a missing girl, who later was found dead. The author argues that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to phones in DND mode, since people asleep can't help spot the car. They also mention their personal struggles, like being unemployed and their wife's long commute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're designed to quickly disseminate information about child abductions to help locate the child quickly. The system is meant to reach as many people as possible, even if that means interrupting sleep. The key here is the balance between public safety and individual convenience.\n\nThe author is upset because their phone was set to DND, and they were disturbed. But Amber Alerts often override DND settings because the urgency of a potential child abduction is considered more critical than individual preferences. The author's complaint is about the system's design, which might be valid in terms of needing improvements. However, the timing and the fact that the alert led to the child being found dead (though the alert itself isn't responsible for the tragedy) complicates things emotionally.\n\nThe author's argument about nuance\u2014like only alerting phones not in DND or having a toggle\u2014is reasonable. But the system as it exists is set up to prioritize safety over personal settings. So the question is whether complaining about the system's current design makes the author an asshole.\n\nThe author also mentions their personal situation, which might make their frustration more understandable, but doesn't excuse the complaint if the system's primary purpose is life-saving. However, the fact that many others also complained suggests it's a common grievance. The catch-22 the author points out\u2014where complaints are seen as insensitive regardless of the outcome\u2014adds another layer. If the alert is criticized when the child is dead and praised if found alive, it's a flawed system.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't malicious; they're frustrated with a system that they believe isn't optimally designed. However, the immediate reaction of being upset about being disturbed during sleep might be seen as less considerate of the emergency. But if the system is flawed, pointing that out isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the author's criticism is valid or if they're being inconsiderate.\n\nGiven that Amber Alerts are a public safety tool, the author's complaint might be seen as valid in terms of needing reform, but the way they expressed it (on Facebook) could come off as dismissive of the alert's purpose. The emotional response to the alert's timing might be justified, but the author could have considered the broader implications of their criticism, especially given the tragic outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is understandable and their suggestions for improvement are reasonable, their public complaint might be seen as insensitive given the context of a child's death. However, it's also a systemic issue that the author is highlighting. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're raising a legitimate critique about the system's design, even if their timing and context of the complaint are problematic.\n"
