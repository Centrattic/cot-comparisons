It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Amber Alert\" story is in the wrong. The author complained about the alert going off at midnight on their phone set to Do Not Disturb. They argue that it shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to people who were asleep. They also mention that the child was later found dead, which makes people question if their complaints make them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Amber Alerts are meant to alert people about missing children, right? The idea is that if more people know, there's a better chance of finding the child quickly. But the author was disturbed during their sleep, which they had set their phone to avoid. They might feel that the system overrode their preferences, leading to unnecessary disruption.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between public safety and individual privacy/space. On one hand, the Amber Alert system relies on people being informed to help locate a missing child. If the alert wasn't urgent enough to override DND, maybe it's a flaw in the system that needs fixing. On the other hand, waking someone up in the middle of the night could be stressful and maybe not effective since people might not be alert enough to notice the described car.\n\nThe author also mentions that the child was found dead later. This adds emotional weight because people might feel that complaining after the fact is insensitive. But the author's argument is that the alert system isn't efficient\u2014maybe if it was more targeted, it would be more effective without disturbing people unnecessarily.\n\nThe author's stance is about improving the system, suggesting that alerts should only go to devices not in DND or have a switch for such alerts. They're not saying the alert shouldn't exist but that its method of delivery could be better. However, after the tragic outcome, some might see their complaints as trivializing the situation, especially since they called the police to complain.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Well, the intention was not to hinder the alert system but to improve it. However, their actions (complaining and calling police) might have been seen as unhelpful during a critical time. The author is not malicious but has valid points about the system's design. However, the timing and the outcome might make their actions seem insensitive, even if the underlying critique is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's tricky. The author isn't the one who caused the child's death, but their reaction after the fact could be seen as callous. However, the system's design is a separate issue. Maybe the real issue is the system's effectiveness and how it handles DND settings, but the author is caught in a dilemma where their valid criticism is overshadowed by the tragic outcome.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't malicious. They're pointing out a flaw in the system, which could lead to improvements. But their complaints after the child's death might come across as cold. However, the fact that they also acknowledge the tragedy and the system's importance shows they care. The real problem is the system's design, not the individual's reaction. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; they're highlighting a need for better systems. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
