It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone despite being on Do Not Disturb. The key points here are understanding the situation and the ethical implications.\n\nFirst, the Amber Alert system is designed to quickly disseminate information about missing children, especially in cases of abduction. The alert in question was sent out widely, including to people whose phones were set to DND, causing a loud interruption at midnight. The author is upset because they feel the system isn't being used effectively\u2014interrupting people who are asleep and not in a position to help spot a car from hours ago and miles away. They also mention their personal context of unemployment and their wife's work situation, adding to their frustration.\n\nThe complication is that the child was later found dead. This makes some people feel that complaining about the alert is insensitive. The author argues that the system should be more nuanced, like allowing users to opt-in for such alerts or not overriding DND settings. They also point out the Catch-22: if the child is found alive, the alert worked; if not, it's still necessary for future cases.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the Amber Alert system is crucial for public safety and preventing harm to children. Complaining about the method of delivery, especially after the tragic outcome, might be seen as insensitive. However, the author's concerns about the system's effectiveness and user disruption are valid. The author isn't denying the importance of Amber Alerts but is pointing out flaws in their implementation. The author's personal circumstances add context to their frustration but don't excuse the complaint if it's seen as dismissive of the system's purpose.\n\nThere's a balance between public safety and individual rights. While the author has a right to express their opinion on improving the system, doing so in a way that's perceived as criticizing the tragedy might be seen as harsh. However, the author's argument is about system design, not the tragedy itself. The fact that many others also called the police to complain suggests it's a common concern.\n\nIn the end, it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out potential improvements to a system that needs to be effective but also respectful of users' privacy and settings. However, the timing and the tragic outcome might make their complaint seem tone-deaf to some. But the right to critique systems for their effectiveness is important, even in sensitive situations. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the criticism is about the system's design and not the event itself.\n"
