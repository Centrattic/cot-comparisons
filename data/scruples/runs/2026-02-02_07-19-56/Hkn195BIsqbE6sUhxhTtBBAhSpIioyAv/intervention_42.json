It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's phone was on Do Not Disturb, but it still received a loud Amber Alert at midnight. They complained on Facebook about the alert being sent too broadly and interrupting people's sleep. They also mentioned that people in DND mode can't help spot the car since it's 58 miles away. The context includes the author's personal struggles and the fact that the child was later found dead, which complicates the reaction.\n\nSo, the core question is: Is it wrong to complain about the Amber Alert's method of delivery, even with the tragic outcome?\n\nAmber Alerts are designed to be urgent and widespread to help locate missing children quickly. The system overrides DND settings because the priority is saving a life. The author is criticizing the system's approach, suggesting it should be more nuanced. However, the alert's purpose is to maximize visibility, even if it's disruptive. \n\nThe author's complaint isn't about the alert itself but the method and timing. They argue that interrupting sleep isn't effective since people can't help from that distance. But in an emergency, even a small chance that someone sees the alert and helps is crucial. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions feeling stress from unemployment and family responsibilities, which might influence their reaction. But that doesn't excuse the complaint if the alert's purpose is to save a life. \n\nWhen the child was found dead, the author's complaint is seen as insensitive. While the author's argument might have logical points about system design, the emotional impact is significant here. People might view the complaint as callous, especially in the aftermath of a tragedy. \n\nHowever, the author's points about improving the system (like having a software switch for alerts) show they're not opposed to Amber Alerts in principle, just the current implementation. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Even if their argument has merit, the timing and the tragic outcome might make their complaint seem inappropriate, regardless of the reasoning.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for publicly complaining in that context, especially after the child's death. The intent to improve the system doesn't negate the insensitivity in the situation. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
