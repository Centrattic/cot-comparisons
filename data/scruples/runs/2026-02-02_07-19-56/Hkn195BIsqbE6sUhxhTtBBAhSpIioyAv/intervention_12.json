It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Amber Alert complaint is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's phone was on Do Not Disturb, and they received a loud Amber Alert at midnight. They complained on Facebook about the broad distribution and overriding DND settings. They argue that the alert shouldn't have been sent so widely or at that time. They also mention their personal context\u2014unemployed, wife is the main earner with a long commute, kids, etc. Then it's revealed that the child in the alert was found dead, which complicates the situation. The author acknowledges the Catch-22 aspect of their argument.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet me consider the key points. The Amber Alert was intended to get the public's help in locating a missing child. The system is designed to prioritize emergencies, even if it disrupts people's sleep. The author is criticizing the system for being too broad and disruptive, especially when devices are on DND. But when the child was found dead, the author's complaint might come off as insensitive, given the tragic outcome.\n\nOn one hand, the author's concerns about the alert's interruption and targeting might be valid. Systems like Amber Alerts often use urgent notifications that override DND settings because the stakes are high. The author's technical suggestions (like allowing opt-out or more nuanced delivery) could be reasonable. However, in the context of a missing child, especially when the alert is sent out in the hope of finding the child alive, the public's response might be more forgiving if the alert works as intended. The fact that the child was found dead adds emotional weight, making the author's complaint seem less compassionate to some.\n\nBut the author also mentions their personal stress (unemployment, family responsibilities), which could make their reaction understandable. They do acknowledge the tragedy and the Catch-22 of their argument. However, the timing and context of their complaint might have been insensitive, especially when the child's death is a recent and tragic event. People might view their criticism as prioritizing their own convenience over the urgency of a life-threatening situation.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the primary goal of an Amber Alert is to save a child's life, even if it means disturbing people. If the system works effectively, even with some disruption, the priority is the immediate danger. The author's frustration is valid, but in the face of a tragic outcome, their complaint could be seen as minimizing the intent of the alert system. \n\nHowever, the author isn't arguing against the system's purpose; they're suggesting improvements. But in the public eye, especially after a death, their criticism might be perceived as not valuing the system's intent, hence making them the \"asshole\" in the AITA context. The key is whether the author's actions (complaining publicly) were inappropriate given the situation's sensitivity.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their complaint could be seen as insensitive post-tragedy, even if their technical points have merit. Public perception in such cases often prioritizes compassion over technical critique, especially when a child's life is lost.\n"
