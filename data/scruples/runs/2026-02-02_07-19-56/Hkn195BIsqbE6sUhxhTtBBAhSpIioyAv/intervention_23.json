It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Amber Alert\" story is in the wrong. The question is a classic AITA (Amber AlertITA?) scenario. The author complained about receiving an Amber Alert at midnight when their phone was on Do Not Disturb. They argue that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly or to devices in DND mode. Additionally, they mention that the child was later found dead, which complicates the situation because some might think complaining is insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They are emergency notifications to help locate abducted children quickly. The system is designed to alert as many people as possible in the affected area, even if that means waking people up. The author's main point is about the disruption caused, but the key here is that the alert's primary goal is to save a life, even if it's an inconvenience.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot with unemployment and family responsibilities, which adds context to their frustration. However, when a child's life is at risk, many people might prioritize the alert's necessity over personal inconvenience. The fact that the child was found dead might lead some to believe that the author's complaint is insensitive, especially since the alert didn't prevent the tragedy but still served its purpose in informing people.\n\nOn the other hand, the author raises valid points about the system's design. There could be improvements, like respecting DND settings or targeting alerts more precisely. But in an emergency, systems might override normal settings to ensure maximum reach. The author's frustration with the system's lack of nuance is understandable, but does that make them the \"asshole\"?\n\nConsidering the balance between public safety and individual inconvenience, most people might side with the system's intent to alert everyone possible. The author's complaint, while understandable, could be seen as missing the point of an Amber Alert's urgency. However, suggesting that the system needs better design (like optional alerts) isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the author's criticism is valid or if they're being inconsiderate given the situation.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh the personal inconvenience against the life-saving purpose. In typical AITA scenarios, when a system is designed for emergencies, the person using or criticizing the system isn't the asshole for pointing out flaws, but if they're dismissive of the emergency's severity, they might be. The author does mention not wanting harm to come to children, so they're not indifferent. However, the act of complaining publicly and calling others to complain might be seen as undermining the system's purpose, especially after the tragic outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's points about system improvements are valid, their public complaint in the context of a tragic outcome might lead some to see them as insensitive. But it's also a debate between personal rights and public safety. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're pointing out potential issues, even if their timing or context is questionable.\n"
