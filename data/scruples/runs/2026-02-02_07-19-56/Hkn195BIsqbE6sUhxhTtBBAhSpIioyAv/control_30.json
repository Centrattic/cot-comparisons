It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone despite being on Do Not Disturb, waking them up. They complained on Facebook about the alert's broad distribution and the fact that it was sent to phones that were silenced. The key points here are their criticism of the alert system's effectiveness and their consideration of their own circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. These alerts are designed to quickly disseminate information about abducted children, relying on the public to help locate them. The system prioritizes speed and reach, even if that means some people might be disturbed. The poster's complaint is that the alert shouldn't override Do Not Disturb settings, especially at midnight when people are likely asleep. They argue that those asleep aren't in a position to help spot the car in question.\n\nOn the other hand, the Amber Alert system's intent is to maximize visibility. If people are in a state where they can't help (asleep), the alert might not be useful to them. However, the system's design might not account for individual phone settings, possibly due to technical or policy reasons. The poster's point about the alerts being overly broad is valid from a privacy or disturbance perspective, but Amber Alerts are considered emergency broadcasts, which often override regular notifications for a reason.\n\nThe poster also mentions their personal context: unemployment, their wife's long commute, and family responsibilities. These factors might influence their sensitivity to being disturbed at night. However, the argument is whether their complaint is justified. They're not denying the importance of Amber Alerts but criticizing the method of delivery.\n\nThe twist comes when the child in the alert is found dead. This complicates the situation because the emotional weight of the situation might make people less sympathetic to complaints about the alert's timing. The poster anticipates this, suggesting it's a Catch-22 where depending on the outcome, people's opinions might shift. If the child was found alive, the alert's effectiveness is praised; if dead, complaints are seen as insensitive.\n\nBut is the poster in the wrong? They expressed a valid concern about the system's impact on people's lives, especially those who had chosen to silence their phones. The system's design might need improvement to balance public safety with individual privacy. However, in the immediate context of a life-threatening situation, the system's priority is to reach as many people as possible, even if it means disturbing some. The poster isn't in the wrong for pointing out flaws in the system, but some might argue that during an emergency, such trade-offs are necessary.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as they raised a reasonable critique of the system's effectiveness and potential for unnecessary disturbance, even if it's a sensitive situation. Their context adds nuance, showing that their complaint was from a place of personal stress rather than indifference to the child's safety.\n"
