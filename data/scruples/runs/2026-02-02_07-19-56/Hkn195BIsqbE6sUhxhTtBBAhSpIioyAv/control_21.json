It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. They complained about it on Facebook, arguing that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly or at midnight when people were asleep. The twist is the child was found dead later, which complicates people's reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. They're meant to quickly spread information about abducted children, relying on the public's help to locate them. The system is designed to override normal notifications to ensure people get the message. The author's complaint is about the alert overriding their DND settings. But if the alert isn't urgent, it might not work as intended. However, in this case, the child was found dead, which adds a layer of tragedy.\n\nThe author mentions they were thinking about their own family situation, their wife's job, etc. That might explain why they were sensitive to being disturbed. But the core issue is whether their complaint was valid. On one hand, they're right that waking people up at midnight when they're asleep might not be effective, as people might not be able to help immediately. On the other hand, in an emergency, immediate notification is crucial, even if it's disruptive. \n\nThe author's argument is that the system should be more nuanced, like allowing users to opt-in for alerts or adjust settings. That's a reasonable point, but does that make them wrong for complaining? Also, the fact that many others also called the police to complain suggests it's a common concern. \n\nHowever, the aftermath of the child's death is a heavy factor. People might feel that any criticism in the aftermath is insensitive, especially since the alert didn't prevent the tragedy. But the author's argument isn't about the outcome; it's about the method. They might be seen as inconsiderate, but they're also pointing out a flaw in the system that could be improved. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's complaint was valid. I think the system's intent is to save lives, and while the method could be better, complaining about the alert being disruptive might come off as insensitive in the wake of the tragedy. However, the author's stance on improving the system isn't inherently wrong. It's a balance between public safety and personal inconvenience. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the system's flaws, but their timing and context might make people see them as insensitive. However, the answer depends on whether the system's primary goal justifies the disruption. Since the author's argument is about improving the system, they're not entirely wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
