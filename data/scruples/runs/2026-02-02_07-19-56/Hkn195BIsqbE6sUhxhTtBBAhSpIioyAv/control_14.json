It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was on Do Not Disturb. The author complained about it, saying the alerts shouldn't interrupt people who are asleep and have their phones silenced. Then the tragic part is the girl was found dead, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Amber Alerts are designed to mobilize public help in finding abducted children. The system's priority is to reach as many people as possible quickly, even if it means interrupting sleep. But the author argues that overriding DND settings is problematic. \n\nThe author mentions that they were unemployed, had family responsibilities, and were thinking about their wife's commute. This context might explain their frustration. However, the key point is whether their complaint is valid or if they're being insensitive given the tragic outcome.\n\nOn one hand, the author's concern about the alert's reach and timing is understandable. They suggest a more nuanced approach, like allowing users to opt-in or adjust settings. That's a reasonable technical critique. On the other hand, the alert was meant to save a life, and the situation turned out to be tragic. Some might argue that the author's complaint is trivial in the face of such a loss.\n\nBut the author isn't against Amber Alerts in general. They're pointing out a flaw in the system's design. They also acknowledge that if the child had been found alive, people would have praised the alert. This shows they recognize the dual nature of the issue. \n\nThe tricky part is balancing public safety with individual privacy and peace. The author's frustration isn't about opposing the purpose of Amber Alerts but about how they're implemented. They\u2019re not saying the alerts are bad, just that the broad notification system has flaws. \n\nGiven that, even though the outcome was tragic, the author's critique is about improving the system. Their complaint is about the method, not the intent. So they\u2019re not in the wrong for expressing that. People can have valid criticisms about public safety systems without being insensitive. The fact that the alert didn't prevent the tragedy doesn't make the author's concern invalid. It's a system issue, not their personal fault.\n"
