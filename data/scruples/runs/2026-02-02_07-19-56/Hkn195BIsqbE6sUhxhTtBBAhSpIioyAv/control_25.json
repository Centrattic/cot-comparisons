It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe person is complaining about receiving an Amber Alert at midnight when their phone was on Do Not Disturb. They felt it was inconsiderate because people might be asleep and couldn't help anyway. They posted this on Facebook and called out the alert system for being too broad. Then they mention that the child was later found dead, which complicates things because some might say that complaining after a tragedy makes you an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're meant to quickly disseminate information about child abductions to help locate the child before harm comes to them. So, the system is designed to be urgent and broad to maximize the chance of recovery. If the alert had gone out earlier and the child was found dead later, maybe the system did its job in time, but in this case, it didn't prevent the tragedy.\n\nThe author's complaint is about the alert overriding Do Not Disturb settings. That's a valid point because if someone has their phone on DND for a reason (like sleeping), interrupting them might not be helpful. But the counterargument is that in an emergency, the system should override normal settings to get the message out as widely as possible. \n\nThe author also mentions they were unemployed and thinking about their wife's job and family situation, which adds context to their frustration. However, this might not be a strong defense if the alert system's primary function is to save lives, even if it's inconvenient.\n\nThe twist is that the child was found dead. Some might argue that the alert should have been heeded more, and complaining about it now is insensitive. But others might say that the system's flaws (like overbroad alerts leading to complacency or complaints) should still be addressed regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe Catch-22 the author mentions is that if the child had been found alive, the same people would praise the alert's effectiveness. This suggests that the criticism is based on outcome bias\u2014judging the action based on the result rather than the appropriateness of the action itself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're pointing out a systemic issue with the alert system's design. On the other hand, after a tragic outcome, their initial complaint might be seen as callous. But considering that the system's design should balance urgency with user settings, and that the author's frustration is about improving the system rather than dismissing the tragedy, they might not be in the wrong. It's a tough call because it's easy to be judgmental after the fact, but the system's flaws should be addressed regardless of the outcome.\n"
