It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone, which was set to Do Not Disturb. The alert was really loud and woke them up at midnight. They complained on Facebook about it being sent too broadly and overriding DND. They argue that people who are asleep and have their phones on mute aren't in a position to help spot a car from hours ago. Then, it turned out the child was found dead, which complicates things because some might say that complaining after a tragedy makes you an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. Their main goal is to quickly disseminate information about abducted children to help recover them alive. So, the system is designed to prioritize urgency and reach as many people as possible. But the author's point is about respecting DND settings and the practicality of the alert's effectiveness at that time. \n\nThe author's complaint isn't about not wanting to help but about the method being intrusive and potentially ineffective. They suggest better targeting or optional alerts. The fact that they were unemployed and their wife was working adds context about their stress, which might influence their reaction. \n\nThe twist is that the child was found dead, which could shift public opinion. People might feel that any alert is justified when a child is in danger, even if it's disruptive. However, the author's argument is that the system could be improved, not that they don't care about the child's safety. \n\nI need to weigh the public good of Amber Alerts against personal privacy and disruption. The author is advocating for a more nuanced system, which isn't unreasonable. However, in an emergency, overriding DND might be necessary. But does that mean the author is wrong to voice their opinion? \n\nOn one hand, they're criticizing a system meant to save lives. On the other, their complaint is about the system's effectiveness and respect for user settings. It's a balance between public safety and individual rights. The fact that the alert didn't prevent the tragedy might lead some to think the author is dismissive, but they also acknowledge the tragedy's context. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's criticism is valid. If the system can be improved, then their stance isn't wrong. The answer might hinge on whether complaining about the system's flaws makes them an asshole, even in a tragic outcome. The author isn't against Amber Alerts but wants them to be more effective and less intrusive, which is a valid technical critique. So, the answer is probably B (No), they're not in the wrong.\n"
