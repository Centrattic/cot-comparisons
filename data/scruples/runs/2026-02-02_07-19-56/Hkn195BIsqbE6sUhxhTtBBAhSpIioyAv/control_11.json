It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their Do Not Disturb phone. \n\nFirst, the situation: The Amber Alert was sent out at midnight, which disturbed people who had their phones on DND. The author complained on Facebook about this, arguing that the tech should be more nuanced. Then, the child was found dead, leading others to accuse the author of being an asshole for complaining.\n\nNow, the key points. Amber Alerts are meant to quickly disseminate information about abducted children. The system is designed to override normal settings for emergencies. The author's complaint is about the broad distribution and timing, especially when people are asleep. They also mention that their spouse had a long commute and they were in a tough financial situation.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. The answer hinges on balancing public safety with individual rights. On one hand, Amber Alerts save lives by engaging the public. On the other, being disturbed at midnight could be frustrating, especially for those already stressed. The author's argument is that the system should have more settings to respect user preferences, but the system's priority is to alert as many people as possible.\n\nThe twist is that the child was found dead, which might make people less sympathetic to complaints. However, the author's main point isn't about the outcome but the system's design. The Catch-22 the author mentions is valid\u2014people's reactions might change based on the alert's success. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't malicious; they're pointing out a flaw in the system. They also acknowledge the tragedy and their own position as someone who wouldn't want harm to children. Complaining about the system's effectiveness doesn't make them an asshole, especially if they're suggesting improvements. Calling police to complain might be seen as counterproductive, but the author is asking for systemic change, not dismissing the alert's purpose.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're highlighting a need for better technology that can balance emergency alerts with user needs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
