It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for complaining about the Amber Alert. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person was in Do Not Disturb mode at midnight, and their phone went off loudly with an Amber Alert. They posted on Facebook about how the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to people with DND enabled. They argue that the system should be more nuanced, maybe not override DND or have an opt-in feature. The catch-22 they mention is that if the child had been found alive, people might have said the alert worked, but since she was found dead, people might think the complainers are heartless.\n\nFirst, I should consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. These alerts are emergency notifications meant to help locate abducted children quickly. The system is designed to reach as many people as possible because time is critical. However, the author's point is that it's disruptive and possibly not effective for people who are asleep and can't help. \n\nThe author's context includes being unemployed and their wife being the primary breadwinner with a long commute. They mention their own kids, so they care about children's safety. But they were in a situation where the alert was inconvenient. \n\nNow, the moral dilemma here is balancing public safety with individual privacy and convenience. The author's complaint is about the system's design, not the purpose of the alert itself. They're not against Amber Alerts in general but think the method of delivery is flawed. \n\nOn one hand, interrupting someone's sleep might be seen as a small price to pay for potentially saving a life. On the other hand, if the system is sending alerts to people who are unlikely to be able to help (asleep, not in the vicinity), maybe it's not the most effective use of resources. \n\nThe fact that the child was found dead complicates things. People might feel that any criticism in such a tragic outcome is insensitive. But the author argues that this is a catch-22. The system's design is being criticized regardless of the outcome, which might not be fair. \n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong. The key points are: Is complaining about the alert's method of delivery (like overriding DND) wrong when the intent is to improve the system? Or is it wrong to prioritize personal convenience over a life-threatening situation?\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They're pointing out a flaw in the system's design that could be improved, not dismissing the importance of Amber Alerts. Their intention seems to be constructive feedback rather than being indifferent to the child's safety. The system should balance effectiveness with respecting individuals' settings. So, the answer is B.\n"
