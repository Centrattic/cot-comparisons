It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on a phone set to Do Not Disturb. The author complained on Facebook, arguing the alert was too broad and shouldn't override DND. They also mentioned their personal context of being unemployed and their wife's work stress. Then the twist is the child was found dead, which complicates the reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The author is upset that the Amber Alert interrupted their sleep, even though it's a critical emergency system. They suggested that the system should be more nuanced, not overriding DND. Others might think that when a child is missing, any help is needed, so alerts should be as broad as possible. But the author is arguing for better targeting or settings.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The main question is whether complaining about the Amber Alert system's approach makes the author an asshole. The author's stance is about improving the system's effectiveness and respecting people's privacy/settings. But the alert's purpose is to maximize the chance of finding the child quickly, which might require being very broad.\n\nHowever, the author's argument has merit. If the system is sending alerts to people who have explicitly chosen DND, maybe there's a flaw. If the system could target only those who have opted in or adjust based on time and location, it might be better. The author isn't saying alerts are bad, but that the method is flawed.\n\nThe twist that the child was found dead adds emotional weight. Some might see the complaint as insensitive given the outcome. But the author is pointing out a systemic issue, not dismissing the tragedy. They might be seen as heartless if the complaint is perceived as prioritizing their convenience over helping find the child. However, if the system is inefficient (alerting people far away where the car was already 58 miles away five hours prior), then maybe the author's point is valid. The problem is that if the alert could have helped someone nearby, but it was sent too broadly, including to people who can't help (like those asleep), it's a Catch-22.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the criticism is valid or if it's insensitive. The author's argument is about system improvement, which is constructive. However, in the context of a tragic outcome, some may view the complaint as tone-deaf. But the author isn't against Amber Alerts; they just want better implementation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're raising a legitimate concern. However, the emotional aspect of the situation might lead some to see the author as inconsiderate. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong, not whether their criticism is popular. The answer is B (No), because the author is making a valid point about system flaws, not being an asshole."
