It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an Amber Alert that came through on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. They posted on Facebook complaining about it and called the system's approach flawed. People are asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The Amber Alert was sent out widely, including to people who had their phones on DND. The author argues that since the phone was silenced, the alert shouldn't override that setting, especially at midnight when people are asleep. They also mention that the alert was for a girl who was later found dead, which complicates the situation. The author was unemployed and thinking about their wife's long commute and family responsibilities.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for complaining. Let's break it down. On one hand, Amber Alerts are crucial for public safety. If a child is in danger, getting the alert out as quickly and widely as possible can help. The fact that the child was found dead might lead some to believe that any criticism of the alert system is insensitive, especially since it didn't save the child but could have helped in another case. People might feel that the author is prioritizing their own inconvenience over the greater good of saving lives.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's complaint is about the system's design. They're pointing out a flaw: that DND settings aren't respected, which could be frustrating and might lead people to ignore future alerts if they're annoyed by them. The author isn't against Amber Alerts in general but wants a more nuanced approach, like allowing users to choose whether to receive them without overriding DND. Their personal context\u2014unemployment, family responsibilities\u2014adds to their stress and might make the alert's timing especially disruptive.\n\nI should also consider the \"Catch-22\" they mention. If the child had been saved, people might say the alert worked. If not, critics say it's insensitive. That seems like a valid point about how outcomes can affect public perception, regardless of the system's effectiveness.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? They expressed frustration with the system's design and raised a valid concern about its implementation. However, the timing and the tragic outcome might make some people view their complaint as inconsiderate. The key is whether their criticism is constructive versus just complaining. The author suggests possible improvements, which shows they're not entirely against the system but want it to be better. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the line between being reasonable and being an asshole is thin. Here, the author is voicing a technical concern but in a context where the system's purpose is life-saving. Depending on perspective, the author's complaint could be seen as justified if the system's design is indeed problematic. However, the fact that they called people who agreed with them \"assholes\" in their post might come off as defensive or dismissive, which could tip the balance.\n\nBut the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the system's intent versus the practical issues, it's a nuanced situation. The author's right to express their frustration exists, but the timing and the tragic outcome might make their complaint seen as insensitive to some. However, since they raised a valid point about system design and offered solutions, maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the criticism is seen as constructive or inconsiderate.\n"
