It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the Facebook post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that disturbed their phone's Do Not Disturb setting. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person was asleep with their phone on DND, and got a loud Amber Alert in the middle of the night. They complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, especially to people who had their phones muted. Their points were that people asleep can't help spot a car from hours ago and that the tech should respect DND settings more. But then the alert was about a girl who was later found dead, so some might say complaining is callous.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. On one hand, Amber Alerts are critical for public safety, especially when a child is in danger. The system is designed to get as many people as possible to help locate the child. If the alert had been effective, maybe the girl would have been found alive sooner. The fact that she was found dead adds emotional weight to the situation, making the author's complaint seem insensitive to some.\n\nOn the other hand, the person had a valid point about the disruption. DND is meant to prevent disturbances, and overriding it might not be the best approach, especially if people are asleep and unlikely to act. Also, the author's context includes personal struggles\u2014unemployment, a spouse with a long commute\u2014so maybe their frustration is understandable. They also suggested improvements to the alert system, like allowing users to opt-in for alerts while keeping DND active for other notifications.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The system's purpose is to maximize chances of finding a missing child, even if it means disturbing people. However, the author's complaint isn't about not getting the alert but about how it was delivered. The debate is about balancing public safety with individual privacy and peace. \n\nThe author's stance is that the system should be more nuanced, which is a reasonable technical argument. However, the timing and the outcome (the child's death) might make people perceive the complaint as insensitivity. But does that make them the \"asshole\"? Or is it a legitimate critique of the system's design? \n\nConsidering that many others also complained to police, it's a common reaction. The author isn't denying the importance of Amber Alerts but suggesting the system could be better. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the emotional aspect of the situation, with the tragic outcome, complicates it. \n\nIn the end, the author's argument is about improving the system rather than dismissing its purpose. So, even though the complaint might seem harsh given the outcome, the underlying concern is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
