It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone despite being on Do Not Disturb.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The Amber Alert is for a missing child. The alert was sent out at midnight, which is when the person was asleep with their phone on DND. They complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disturbing people who were trying to sleep. They argue that the system should be more nuanced, maybe not override DND or have optional settings.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong because the child was found dead, so complaining about the alert seems insensitive given the tragic outcome. But the author also brings up their own circumstances, like being unemployed and thinking about their wife's work stress. They also mention that if the child had been found alive, the complaints might be seen as justified.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the intent of Amber Alerts is to save lives by mobilizing the public. The system is designed to interrupt normal notifications to ensure people get the alert. However, the author is criticizing the system's approach, suggesting it's too disruptive and not targeted properly. The fact that the child died might make people feel the complaints are inappropriate, but the author's argument is about the system's effectiveness and ethics regardless of the outcome.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is raising a valid point about the balance between public safety and personal privacy/interruption. Amber Alerts are meant to reach as many people as possible, but maybe there's a way to make them less intrusive. On the other hand, in a life-threatening situation, the system prioritizes urgency over convenience. The author's criticism might be seen as not considering the severity of the situation, especially after the child's death. However, the author also points out the inconsistency in public opinion depending on the outcome, which is a valid catch-22.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The \"asshole\" in the title is part of the AITA format, where the person is questioning their own judgment. The author's complaint is about the system's design, not malicious intent. They even acknowledge the tragedy but still stand by their argument. \n\nIn the end, whether they're in the wrong depends on prioritizing life-saving measures versus respecting individual settings. Some might say the system's purpose overrides personal inconvenience, making the author wrong. Others might agree that the system needs improvement, so the author isn't in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Given the tragic outcome, the author's criticism might be seen as insensitive, but the point about system design is valid. The answer isn't straightforward, but considering the context, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're advocating for a better system, even if the timing was bad.\n"
