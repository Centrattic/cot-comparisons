It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight when the author had their phone on Do Not Disturb. They complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disturbing people who were asleep. Now, the girl was found dead, which complicates things because people might think that complaining about the alert makes you an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're meant to help find missing children quickly. So, when someone is abducted, especially by a parent, time is critical. The system is designed to reach as many people as possible, even if it's in the middle of the night, because even a few minutes can make a difference in such cases. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author's complaint is about the alert overriding the DND setting. They argue that people who have their phones on silent and asleep aren't in a position to help. It's a valid point because if the alert is too disruptive when it's not necessary, it might cause people to ignore future alerts or turn off their phones entirely. Also, the author mentions being unemployed and the stress about their wife's job, which adds context to their frustration. \n\nHowever, the key factor here is that the child was found dead. People might feel that the alert, despite being disruptive, was crucial, and the author's complaint seems insensitive in the aftermath. The author acknowledges the Catch-22, understanding that if the child had been found alive, the alert's effectiveness would have been praised. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Public safety is a high priority, and Amber Alerts are designed for emergencies. Complaining about the alert's timing and reach while downplaying the urgency of the situation could be seen as dismissive of the importance of saving a child's life. But the author does mention they wouldn't want harm to come to their kids, so they do care. \n\nStill, the timing of the complaint and the disruption caused by the alert might not be as important as the fact that the alert was trying to save a life. Even if the alert was overly broad, the intention was to help. The author's frustration is understandable, but in the context of a tragic outcome, their complaint might come across as heartless. \n\nOn the other hand, they are raising a valid technical point about the system's design. The system might need to be more nuanced, considering DND settings or providing a way for users to opt-in. But the question is whether the author is the asshole. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often prioritize immediate action over inconvenience, even if it's not perfect. The author's complaint is about the system's flaws, but in a real-life scenario where a child's life is at stake, the system's effectiveness might be more important than individual inconvenience. \n\nHowever, the author isn't against the system itself but is pointing out that the design could be improved. It's a balance between public safety and personal privacy/interruption. The fact that the child was found dead might lead some to think that the author's criticism is less valid now, but that's a Catch-22 as they mentioned. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is understandable and their point about the system's design has merit, the context of a tragic outcome might make their complaint seem insensitive. However, they aren't entirely wrong because the system could be better designed. But in terms of being the \"asshole,\" maybe the answer is that they are not, because they're pointing out a flaw, even if their timing or phrasing was off.\n"
