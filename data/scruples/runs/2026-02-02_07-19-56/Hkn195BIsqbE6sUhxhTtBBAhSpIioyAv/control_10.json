It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their phone, even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. They complained on Facebook about it, saying it shouldn't have been so broadly sent, especially to people who were asleep. Then the girl in the alert was found dead, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. They're meant to quickly disseminate information about a missing child, hoping that many people can help locate them. The system is designed to override normal phone settings to ensure maximum reach. So, from a public safety standpoint, the alerts are crucial. But the user is arguing that it's disruptive and not effective when people are asleep and can't help. \n\nThe person also mentions their personal situation: unemployed, wife as the sole breadwinner with a long commute, kids. They were thinking about their family's stress. But when the child was found dead, they're now being called insensitive because the alert didn't \"work\" in saving the child. However, they counter that if the child had been found alive, the same people would say the alert worked.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether complaining about the alert's disruption is valid when the outcome is tragic. On one hand, the alert's purpose is to save lives, and the technology's design overrides DND for emergencies. On the other hand, the author's complaint is about the system's nuance and effectiveness, not dismissing the alert's importance. They even suggest improvements like a software switch for alerts, which shows they care about the system working better.\n\nThe author isn't denying the severity of the situation; they acknowledge the tragedy. Their complaint is about the method of delivery, not the cause itself. People might feel that in such a tragic outcome, any criticism sounds callous, but the author's argument is more about systemic efficiency. Also, many others contacted police to complain, suggesting it's a common concern.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, public safety systems need to balance urgency with user experience. The author's stance is that there's room for improvement without dismissing the need for alerts. So, technically, they're not in the wrong for pointing out flaws in the system, even if it's a sensitive topic. However, the way they expressed their complaint might come off as insensitive, but the intent was to find a better solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because their criticism is about the system's effectiveness and implementation, not the importance of the Amber Alert itself.\n"
