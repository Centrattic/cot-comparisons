It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that interrupted their Do Not Disturb setting at midnight. The alert was about a missing child, which later turned out to be tragic.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that the Amber Alert shouldn't have been sent to people with their phones on DND, especially at midnight when they were likely asleep. They feel it's intrusive and not useful since those people can't help at that time. They also mention their personal context of being unemployed and their wife's important work commute, which adds to their stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the alert's purpose is to get as many people as possible to help locate a missing child quickly. Amber Alerts are designed to be urgent and widespread. The fact that the child was found dead complicates the situation, as some might argue that any alert is better than none, even if it's disruptive. But the author points out a Catch-22 where people criticize the alert if the child is found dead, but praise it if the child is found alive.\n\nI need to consider the balance between public safety and individual privacy/peace. While the alert's intention is good, the method of delivery could be more considerate. The author isn't opposing the alert system but suggesting it should be more nuanced\u2014like respecting DND settings or having a way to opt-in. Their complaint isn't about the alert's purpose but its execution.\n\nAlso, the author is reflecting on the system's flaws rather than being insensitively critical. They acknowledge the system's intent and the tragedy, but still feel the approach is flawed. Many others called the police to complain, which suggests it's a common concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out a potential flaw in the system. Their critique is about improving the system rather than dismissing the need for Amber Alerts. So, the answer is B.\n"
