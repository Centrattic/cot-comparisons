It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Amber Alert\" situation is in the wrong. The author complained about being woken up by an Amber Alert on their phone despite it being on Do Not Disturb. The alert was about a child abduction, and the child was later found dead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical dilemma here. On one hand, Amber Alerts are designed to quickly inform the public about abducted children, which could help in rescuing them. On the other hand, the alert interrupted the author's sleep, and they felt it was unnecessary because they were in a different area and couldn't help. The author also points out that the alert wasn't effective since the child was found dead later, which adds complexity.\n\nThe author's argument is about the balance between public safety and personal inconvenience. They suggest that the system should be more nuanced, not overriding Do Not Disturb settings unless necessary. But the counterargument is that in emergencies, overriding DND is justified to maximize the chance of finding the child quickly.\n\nI should consider the intent of Amber Alerts. They are meant to spread critical information fast. If the system doesn't alert everyone, even those in less likely areas, maybe it's better to be overcautious. But the author's frustration is valid because being woken up for something you can't contribute to might be seen as intrusive. However, when a child's life is at stake, the public's role in spreading information is crucial.\n\nThe author also mentions feeling entitled to complain because of their personal struggles, like unemployment and their wife's work stress. But does that justify the complaint in this context? Maybe not. The situation isn't about their personal issues but about a public safety measure.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the child was found dead might make people feel guilty for complaining. But the author is aware of the Catch-22\u2014either way, someone might find fault. Yet, the core issue is whether complaining about the alert is wrong regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who sent the alert. They're expressing frustration with the system's design. So technically, they aren't the \"asshole\" for voicing their opinion, but they might be seen as insensitive because the alert was for a serious situation. However, the author also acknowledges the importance of such alerts for children's safety, so their intent isn't malicious.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the complaint is seen as valid or dismissive of the alert's purpose. The author is advocating for a more thoughtful system, not dismissing the urgency of child abductions. Therefore, while the complaint might seem insensitive in hindsight, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out a potential flaw in the system's design.\n"
