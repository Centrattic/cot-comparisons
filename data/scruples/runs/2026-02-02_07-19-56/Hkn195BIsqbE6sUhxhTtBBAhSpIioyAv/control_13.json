It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. The author complained about this, arguing that the alert shouldn't override DND settings, especially in the middle of the night when people are asleep. They also mention their personal context of unemployment and their wife being the sole breadwinner, which adds to their stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. They're designed to quickly spread information about child abductions, which are emergencies. The system likely prioritizes reaching as many people as possible to maximize the chance of finding the child quickly. The author's complaint is about the alert disrupting their sleep and being ineffective because it was sent to people in a different location. But the Amber Alert system might not have the capability to target only phones not in DND mode, or maybe it's a legal requirement to send them to all devices in a certain area.\n\nThe author mentions that the child was found dead later, which adds emotional weight. Some might say that complaining about the alert is insensitive given the tragic outcome. However, the author's argument is about the system's effectiveness and respect for personal settings. They're suggesting that the system could be improved to be more nuanced, which is a valid technical critique.\n\nOn the other hand, in an emergency, overriding personal settings could be justified to save a life. People might feel that the greater good is served by getting the alert out, even if it's inconvenient. The author's frustration is understandable, but the system's design is meant to prioritize the child's safety over individual preferences.\n\nThe author also points out the Catch-22 where complaints depend on the outcome. This is a common critique of such scenarios\u2014people's reactions change based on the result. However, the author's main point is about the system's effectiveness and user experience, not the outcome of this particular case.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their frustration about the system's design. They're advocating for a better approach that balances emergency needs with user preferences. However, there's an argument that in an emergency, overriding DND is necessary. But the author isn't against the alert itself, just the method of delivery. So, their stance is more about improving the system rather than opposing it. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
