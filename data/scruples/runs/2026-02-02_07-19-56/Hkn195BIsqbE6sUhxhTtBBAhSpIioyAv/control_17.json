It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong after complaining about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone despite being in Do Not Disturb mode.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The Amber Alert was sent out at midnight, disturbing people who had their phones on DND. The author is upset because they were asleep and couldn't help, arguing that the system should be more nuanced. Then there's the twist that the child was found dead later, which complicates the reaction. \n\nNow, the author's main points are about the alert system's overreach\u2014\u6253\u6270\u5230\u90a3\u4e9b\u660e\u786e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e86\u52ff\u6270\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u8be5\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u53ea\u63d0\u9192\u90a3\u4e9b\u6ca1\u5f00\u542f\u52ff\u6270\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8ba9\u5236\u9020\u5546\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5173\u95ed\u7684\u9009\u9879\uff08\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5f00\u542f\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u7eaf\u5730\u62b1\u6028\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u5931\u4e1a\uff0c\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ecf\u6d4e\u538b\u529b\u5927\uff0c\u59bb\u5b50\u9700\u8981\u65e9\u8d77\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u4ed6\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8ba9\u4ed6\u5bf9\u7a81\u7136\u7684\u6253\u6270\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002\n\nBut then the child's death is mentioned. This is a crucial point. Some might say that when a child is in danger, the system's broad approach is necessary to maximize the chance of finding them quickly. Complaining about the alert might be seen as insensitive, especially after the tragic outcome. However, the author's argument is about the system's effectiveness and user experience. Even if the alert was necessary, the method of delivery could be improved. It's a balance between urgency and respecting people's privacy/sleep.\n\nThe author also points out the Catch-22: if the child was found alive, the same people might praise the alert's effectiveness. Now that the outcome is tragic, the criticism is met with more judgment. This suggests that the author is aware of the sensitivity but still believes the system has flaws.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, being upset about being disturbed during a personal time, especially given their circumstances, is understandable. Their critique is about improving the system rather than dismissing the importance of Amber Alerts. However, the emotional weight of the situation (a dead child) might make people more forgiving of the system's approach. But the author isn't against Amber Alerts; they want them to be more effective and less intrusive. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're raising valid points about technology and user settings. The situation is complex, and there's no clear right or wrong. The key is that the author's complaint is about the method, not the purpose. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
