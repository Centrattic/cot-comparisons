It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about an Amber Alert that came through on their phone even though it was set to Do Not Disturb. The person complained on Facebook about the alert being too broad and disturbing people who were asleep. Additional context is that the child was later found dead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand Amber Alerts. They are emergency alerts for missing children, especially in cases of abduction. The system is designed to get as many people as possible to help locate the child quickly. The author's complaint is about the alert overriding Do Not Disturb, which they think is unnecessary because people who are asleep can't help.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot\u2014unemployed, thinking about their wife who had to work, and has kids. They argue that the alert system should be more nuanced. But after the child was found dead, the author is being called an asshole for complaining.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between public safety and individual inconvenience. On one hand, Amber Alerts are crucial for quickly mobilizing the public to help find a missing child. On the other hand, waking people up in the middle of the night might not be effective, as they can't help then. Also, the alert system might not consider Do Not Disturb settings for emergencies, but the user is questioning if that's the right approach.\n\nBut since the child died, people might feel that any alert system that could have helped is justified. However, the author's argument isn't about not wanting alerts, but about the method of delivery being inappropriate. They're suggesting better targeting or a more intelligent system.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to question the system's effectiveness when it causes unnecessary disruption? The author isn't denying the importance of Amber Alerts but is pointing out a flaw in their implementation. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the fact that the child died might make people more sensitive, leading to the perception that criticizing the system is insensitive. But the author's context about their own situation adds nuance\u2014they\u2019re not indifferent; they have a family too.\n\nThe answer depends on whether complaining about the alert's method is seen as trivializing the situation. If the author is seen as prioritizing their own comfort over public safety, they might be at fault. But if their criticism is constructive and aimed at improving the system, they\u2019re justified.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong because they're advocating for a more effective and considerate alert system, not dismissing the need for Amber Alerts. Their complaint is about the implementation, not the purpose. So the answer is B.\n"
