It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their phone, even though it was on Do Not Disturb mode. The situation is that the alert was sent out widely, including to people who had their phones muted, and the author is upset because it's not useful during the night when people are asleep. They also mention their wife is a single parent with a long commute, and they were thinking about their own kids, but they were critical of the alert system's approach.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent of the Amber Alert. These alerts are designed to quickly disseminate information about abducted children to increase the chance of finding them alive. The system prioritizes reaching as many people as possible in a short time. However, sending it at midnight to people on DND might be seen as intrusive and not effective, since people are asleep and can't help. The author's argument is that the technology should be more nuanced, like not overriding DND or having a switch for such alerts.\n\nOn the other hand, the author complained publicly, which could be seen as insensitive given the tragic outcome of the child being found dead. The counter-argument is that in such emergencies, even a small chance of someone seeing the alert is worth it. But the author's point is valid about the effectiveness of notifying people who are asleep, especially if the alert is for an event five hours old in a distant location. It's possible the person could help if they're awake, but if they're on DND, they probably can't.\n\nThe post also references a Catch-22 where if the child was found alive, the same complaints would be dismissed as unnecessary, but if found dead, the complainers are considered inconsiderate. The author is highlighting the inconsistency in public reaction based on the outcome, which is a logical point.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The system's design is to override DND to get the message out, but the author is questioning the effectiveness and the disturbance. Their complaint includes valid points about the system's need for improvement, not just blanket overrides. Publicly voicing this might come off as harsh, especially with the tragic outcome, but the argument isn't entirely without merit. The answer would need to balance the system's purpose with the author's reasonable critique. The final answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for questioning the system's effectiveness and suggesting improvements, even if it's a sensitive topic.\n"
