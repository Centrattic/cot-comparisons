It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Facebook post is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight on their Do Not Disturb (DND) phone. The key points here are the context of the Amber Alert system, the user's complaint about the alert's distribution, and the subsequent backlash after the child was found dead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how Amber Alerts typically work. From what I know, Amber Alerts are designed to get widespread attention quickly in cases of child abduction, so they're sent out to a broad audience. They might override DND settings because the priority is getting the information out as fast as possible. However, there's a debate about whether this is the best approach, especially if it's causing significant disturbance to people who might not be able to help, like those asleep.\n\nThe author's complaint centers around the alert being sent to people with DND enabled and at midnight, arguing that it's unlikely those people can help. They also mention their personal situation\u2014unemployment, wife's long commute, etc.\u2014to provide context for their frustration. Then, after the child was found dead, they're facing criticism for being insensitive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to express their frustration. On one hand, people might argue that the author is selfish for complaining about a life-threatening situation. On the other hand, the author is pointing out a flaw in the system's design\u2014alerts that disrupt sleep might not be effective and could lead to complaints that overshadow the actual purpose. The author isn't against the Amber Alerts themselves but is critical of how they're implemented.\n\nThere's also the point about the Catch-22: if the child was found alive, the system would be praised, but if dead, the critics are blamed. This seems like a valid point, highlighting the unfairness of judging the action based on the outcome.\n\nLegally and morally, is it wrong to critique a system's methodology in a tragic situation? The author's intent wasn't to downplay the child's safety but to argue for a more effective alert system. However, in the heat of the moment, such criticisms might come off as insensitive, especially when the outcome is tragic. But does that make the author wrong in their stance?\n\nConsidering the balance between public safety and individual privacy/disturbance, the author's argument isn't without merit. There's room for improvement in how alerts are delivered. The fact that many others contacted the police to complain suggests that this is a shared concern. However, the tone and timing of the complaint (on Facebook) might have contributed to the perception of insensitivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for raising a valid critique about the alert's distribution method, even if the outcome was tragic. The system's flaws are worth discussing, and the author's personal context adds to the argument that the alert's timing was problematic. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
