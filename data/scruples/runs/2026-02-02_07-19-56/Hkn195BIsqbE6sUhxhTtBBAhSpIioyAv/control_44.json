It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an Amber Alert that went off on their phone even though it was on Do Not Disturb. They complained about it on Facebook, arguing that it shouldn't be so broad and interrupt people who are trying to sleep. Then the child was found dead, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of an Amber Alert. They're meant to quickly spread information about a missing child, right? The idea is that more people seeing the alert might help find the child faster. So, interrupting people's sleep could be justified in an emergency. But the author's point is that people with DND on are probably asleep and not in a position to help. Maybe the system isn't as effective as it could be if it's going to people who can't act on it immediately.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author mentions personal struggles, like being unemployed and their wife being the sole breadwinner. They might be stressed, which could influence their reaction. But does that make their complaint valid or invalid? Probably not directly, but it adds context to their frustration.\n\nNow, the catch-22 they mention: if the child was found alive, people would say the alert worked, but since she was found dead, they're called heartless for complaining. That seems like a double standard. The author is pointing out that the effectiveness of the alert isn't just about whether the child was found, but also about how the system is implemented. Maybe the system needs improvement regardless of the outcome.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're voicing a concern about the system's design. Even in a tragic situation, questioning how alerts are sent (like overriding DND) could be seen as trying to improve the system. However, some might argue that in such emergencies, the priority is to get the message out no matter what. But the author isn't against Amber Alerts in general; they just think the delivery method could be more nuanced. So, maybe they're not in the wrong, but it's a sensitive issue. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're advocating for better technology use, not dismissing the alert's purpose."
