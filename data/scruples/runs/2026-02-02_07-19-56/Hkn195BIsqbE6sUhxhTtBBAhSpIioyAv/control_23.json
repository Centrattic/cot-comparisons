It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong for complaining about an Amber Alert that went off at midnight and was loud. The key points here are the situation where the Amber Alert was sent out when their phone was on Do Not Disturb, the fact that the child was found dead, and the author's justification based on their personal circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of Amber Alerts. They're designed to quickly disseminate information about a missing child, possibly to prevent harm or locate them. However, they can be intrusive because they override phone settings. The user's complaint is about the system's overreach, especially when people are asleep. They argue that the alerts shouldn't override Do Not Disturb, as asleep individuals can't help spot the car, and the alert might be unnecessary for those in a different location.\n\nThe author mentions being unemployed and their wife's work situation, suggesting stress and fatigue. This might influence their frustration with the alert. However, the twist is that the child was found dead, which complicates the situation. Critics might say that complaining about the alert is insensitive given the tragic outcome. But others might argue that the system's design still needs improvement, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThe author also points out the Catch-22: if the alert had led to a positive outcome, complaints would be minimized, but since the child died, complaints are seen as heartless. This raises questions about whether the system's effectiveness should be judged on outcomes, which the author critiques as a weak argument.\n\nI need to weigh the intention behind the complaint. The author isn't against Amber Alerts in general but is advocating for better design\u2014like respecting Do Not Disturb settings or having a toggle. Their main point is about the system's nuance. The tragedy doesn't negate the validity of their technical critique, but the emotional context of the outcome complicates public perception.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the author in the wrong? They're not opposing the purpose of Amber Alerts; they're suggesting improvements. However, the timing and the outcome might make their complaint seem insensitive. But if the system is flawed, pointing that out isn't inherently wrong. The answer hinges on whether the complaint is valid as a critique of the system's design versus being a personal grievance against the alert's timing.\n\nAlso, considering others who contacted police to complain, it's possible that the system needs adjustment to avoid waking people who can't act. But the urgency of Amber Alerts versus the right to undisturbed sleep is a balance that's hard to achieve. The user's situation is relatable\u2014being tired, stressed, then disturbed by an alert. However, when a child's life is at stake, the value of immediate alerts is paramount. Yet, the system's overreach shouldn't be ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the system's flaws, but they might be seen as insensitive due to the tragic outcome. However, the argument about the system's design still holds merit. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because the critique is valid, even if the situation is emotionally charged.\n"
