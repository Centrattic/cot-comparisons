I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The author mentions they're a straight guy and that their ex is biologically female but now identifies as male.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The partner was open about their gender identity, and the author realized their sexuality doesn't align. The key here is whether the breakup was a legitimate decision based on the author's sexuality or if it's discriminatory.\n\nThe author says they're not against trans people but don't want to date someone who's trans. That might touch on issues of transphobia or misunderstanding. If someone is trans, their gender identity is valid regardless of biological sex. So if the author is rejecting a relationship because the person's gender doesn't align with their own, that's a choice, but if they're rejecting because of trans identity, that's a different matter.\n\nThe partner was upfront about their identity. The author's decision to break up seems based on their own sexuality, but if their definition of \"straight\" is strictly about biological sex, that might not account for gender identity. However, in many cases, people define straight as being attracted to the gender they're not part of. So if the author is a man attracted to women, and the partner is now identifying as male, then the author's stance is about their own sexual orientation.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The problem here is that the partner might feel the breakup is due to their gender identity, which could be seen as transphobic. However, the author claims it's about their sexuality. There's a fine line here. If the author is comfortable with trans people in general but not with their own partner's transition, it's more about personal compatibility than discrimination. However, if the author is rejecting a trans person because they don't see them as the gender they identify as, that's where the issue lies.\n\nThe key point in the scenario is that the author is a straight man, and their partner transitioned from female to male. If the author is only attracted to women, and the partner is now identifying as male, then the author's feelings are about their own orientation. However, if the author is treating the partner as still female but rejecting them because they transitioned, that could be problematic. The author's confusion about pronouns and the partner's identity might contribute to their decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for breaking up if they're honest about their feelings. But if the breakup is based on transphobia, then they would be. The author seems to think it's about their sexuality, not the partner's gender identity. However, this can be a nuanced issue where the line between personal preference and discrimination is thin.\n\nThe partner's reaction treating the author as an asshole might be due to feeling invalidated. The author's decision to break up for not wanting to date a trans person, even if they claim to be straight, could be seen as not respecting the partner's identity. Some might argue that the author's definition of straight doesn't account for gender identity, which is a core aspect of the partner's being.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on whether the breakup is based on the partner's gender identity or the author's sexual orientation. If it's the latter, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their feelings. If it's the former, they could be discriminatory. Given the author's explanation, they might be in the right, but there's a possibility of misunderstanding their partner's transition.\n"
