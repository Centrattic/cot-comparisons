I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a straight guy in high school who's been dating someone for almost a year. The person they broke up with is biologically female but now identifies as a guy and is trans. The author says they made subtle comments about feeling more like a guy before, and after a haircut and using a binder, they were told to refer to them as a guy. The author then broke up because they don't want to date a guy, even if trans. The ex is upset and treating them like an asshole, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key factors here. The author states they are straight, so their sexual orientation is towards the opposite sex, which in their current context would be girls. The person they were dating came out as trans, identifying as a guy. The author's reason for breaking up is that their sexuality makes it not work. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nNow, I need to think about societal norms and understanding. Being trans is about a person's gender identity, not their biological sex. So if the author is in a relationship with someone who transitioned, that person may still be considered male or female in terms of gender depending on their identity. However, the author is a straight guy, so if their SO now identifies as a guy, then from a straight perspective, they might not be interested in dating someone of the same gender. But wait, in many cases, trans men are still women in terms of biological sex. So if the author is straight, does that mean he's only interested in women, or is he interested in people whose gender identity is female? This is a bit confusing.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were dating for almost a year. The SO had been hinting about their gender identity before, so the author might not have realized the extent of these hints. When the SO came out, the author felt the need to break up because it conflicts with their sexuality. The author tried to be gentle but still ended the relationship.\n\nThe ex is upset, but is the author's action justified? If the author is straight and the relationship is no longer matching their sexuality after the SO's transition, is that a valid reason to break up? On the other hand, does the author have a responsibility to stay in the relationship and adjust, given that the SO is still the same person? Or is it about the author's own comfort and orientation?\n\nI know that in consensual relationships, both parties should feel comfortable. If the author's sexuality is such that they can't date someone who now identifies as their same gender, then that's a personal choice. But some might argue that if the person is trans, they are still the same person the author fell in love with, and the author's decision is based on the SO's gender identity rather than any change in the person. However, the author's sexuality is a core part of their identity, so it's not necessarily wrong to act on that if they're not interested in same-sex relationships.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't know about the transition before. They had been dating someone who they thought was a girl. Now, after the transition, the author may no longer be interested. This is a change in the relationship's dynamics, but is it the author's fault? If the SO had come out earlier, maybe the author could have processed it before the relationship became serious. But since the SO had been making subtle comments, maybe the author missed the signs. But the author tried to be understanding and is now facing backlash.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author's decision is based on their sexual orientation, which is a personal matter. However, if the author had preferences that conflict with the SO's identity, isn't it better to be honest? The issue here is that the author's SO is trans, and the author's sexuality is straight. If the author is only interested in cisgender women, then dating a trans man (who is biologically female) might not align with that. But some people argue that trans men are men and thus a straight guy might still be interested in them, depending on how they view gender.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship because the SO is trans. If the author is straight and now finds themselves in a same-sex relationship due to the SO's transition, then that's a conflict with their sexuality. However, some might say that the author should have considered the SO's identity and that the gender transition doesn't erase their previous connection. \n\nBut the key point is: is the author's sexuality a valid reason to end the relationship? If the author is not interested in people who identify as their same gender, then it's their choice. But if the author is only interested in people who are biologically female, then the trans SO, who is still biologically female, would still be a match. However, the author's perception might be that their SO is now a guy, making it a same-sex relationship. \n\nIn many cases, the validity of the author's reason depends on their understanding of gender and sexuality. If the author views gender strictly in a binary and biological sense, then they might see this as a problem. If they view gender as a social construct or identity, then they might feel it's a same-sex relationship. \n\nGiven that the author is in high school and might not have a fully developed understanding of gender identity, their reaction could stem from genuine confusion rather than malice. They also mentioned they tried to be gentle. \n\nHowever, the ex is upset and feels the author is an asshole. The author might be accused of being transphobic, but the author claims to be fine with trans people in general. The problem is their personal sexual orientation, which they don't see as compatible with dating a trans guy. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. If the author's sexuality is strictly heteronormative (only interested in people who are biologically female and identify as such), then maybe the author is not in the wrong because the relationship no longer aligns with their preferences. But if the author's decision is based on the SO's gender identity, which is a core part of the SO's self, then some might argue the author is in the wrong for not accepting their partner's identity. However, the author isn't rejecting the person for being trans; they're saying their sexual orientation doesn't include same-sex relationships. So it's a bit of a gray area, but the answer might be B (No) because the author is acting on their own sexuality, even if it's a change in the relationship. Still, others might see it as wrong for not accepting the partner's identity. I need to decide based on common viewpoints. In many discussions, people say that if the partner is still the same person, then the author's decision is based on the partner's gender, which could be seen as problematic. So the answer might be A (Yes), but the author's claim to being straight complicates it. Since the author is in a relationship where the partner's gender identity has changed, maybe the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their initial perception over the partner's identity. But I'm not sure. Another angle is that the author is honest about their preferences and not pretending to be interested when they don't. That could be seen as respectful. Hmm. This is tricky. I think there's no clear right or wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is being honest and not transphobic, perhaps B (No). But if they're not accepting the partner's true identity, A (Yes). The author's reasoning is based on their own sexuality, so it's a personal choice. However, some might argue that a person's gender identity is essential to their being, so if the author can't accept that, he may not be the right partner. But the author wasn't aware of the transition before. So the answer is B (No), because the author is acting on their own sexual preferences, which are valid, even if it's a difficult situation. The ex might be upset, but the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to date a guy.\n"
