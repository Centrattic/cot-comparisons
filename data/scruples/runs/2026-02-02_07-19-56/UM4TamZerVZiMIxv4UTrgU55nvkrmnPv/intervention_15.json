I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style question is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The author identifies as a straight guy and says they don't want to date a guy, trans or not. Their partner is biologically female but now identifies as male.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're in high school, which is a time of developing identity and relationships. The partner had been making subtle comments about feeling more like a guy before coming out. The author didn't realize until the partner transitioned with a haircut and binder. The author then broke up, explaining their straightness. The partner is upset and treating them as an asshole. The author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks they are, but the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no wrong here. Legally, people can end relationships for any reason. But morally or socially, it's more complex. The author is being honest about their sexuality. They don't want to date someone who is male, regardless of being trans. The partner might argue that the author is being discriminatory, but the author is stating their sexual orientation as straight. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is conflating gender identity with sexuality. Trans men are men, so if the author is straight, they are supposed to be attracted to women. But if the partner is a trans man, the author is ending the relationship because the person they were dating is now identifying as male. So the author's reasoning is based on their self-identified straightness. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author tried to be gentle. The partner is upset, which is understandable. But the author is being honest about their feelings. Some might say that the author is not wrong for prioritizing their own sexuality, while others might say they should have tried to adjust or that the partner's identity shouldn't matter if they're the same person.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had enough understanding of their partner's identity. The author mentions they misinterpreted some comments before. Maybe they should have asked earlier or been more open. But the partner did come out after changes in appearance and behavior, which the author asked about directly.\n\nIn terms of societal views, being trans is a valid identity. The author is choosing not to date someone because they are trans, which can be seen as discriminatory. However, the author is also being honest about their sexual orientation. So it's a bit of a conflict. \n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. If the author is a woman who is into trans men, that's a different scenario, but they say they're a straight guy. From a purely personal standpoint, they are not wrong for ending the relationship if their orientation is straight. However, the partner's feelings of being rejected might be valid, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether you prioritize the individual's right to self-identify and their partner's sexual orientation. Legally and morally, the author is not in the wrong. They are acting according to their own beliefs and sexuality. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
