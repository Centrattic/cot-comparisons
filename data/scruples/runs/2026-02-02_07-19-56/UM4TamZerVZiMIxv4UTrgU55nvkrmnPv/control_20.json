I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a high school relationship where the SO comes out as trans, and the author breaks up because they're straight and don't want to date a guy, trans or not. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a straight guy who's been dating someone who's biologically female but identifies as male. The SO came out as trans, and the author ended the relationship. The author is being criticized, but they're trying to explain their reasoning based on their sexuality.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author's reasoning is that their sexuality is such that they don't want to date a male, regardless of being trans. Now, trans men are men. So if the author identifies as straight and only dates women, then dating a trans man would technically be dating a man, which conflicts with their orientation. But some might argue that the author is making a distinction between trans and cis, which could be seen as transphobic.\n\nBut the author says they're fine with trans people. The issue is about their own sexual orientation. If the author's orientation is strictly heterosexual (only attracted to women), then they can't help how they feel. However, some people might argue that being trans is about identity, and the author is invalidating that by ending the relationship based on gender identity, not the person they are.\n\nAlso, the SO is upset because they feel the author is rejecting them for who they are. The author tried to be gentle but the breakup still happened. The question is whether that's acceptable. Legally and ethically, people have the right to their own sexual orientation. But there's a line when it leads to discrimination. The author isn't necessarily being discriminatory if it's about their own orientation, but some might see it as discrimination against the trans person.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting based on their own sexuality. However, others might say that trans men are men and the author is making a choice that's transphobic. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author is being honest and not discriminatory towards trans people in general, but just can't reconcile their own orientation, it's more about personal orientation rather than prejudice. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
