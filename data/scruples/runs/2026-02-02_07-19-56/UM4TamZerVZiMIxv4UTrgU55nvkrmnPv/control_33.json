For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with their SO after finding out they're trans. The situation is that they're in high school, the SO is biologically female but transitioned, and the author is a straight guy who doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the issue. The author is straight and identifies as such, so they feel their sexual orientation makes it incompatible. The SO is trans and transitioned, so the author is breaking up because their understanding of their sexuality doesn't align with the new gender identity of their partner.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a moral question. Some might say that the author is being discriminatory because they're rejecting the SO based on their gender identity. However, others might argue that people have the right to date according to their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is about who you're attracted to, and if the author identifies as straight, then being attracted to someone who is male (transgender) might not fit that, especially if the person presents as male now.\n\nBut wait, there's also the aspect of the SO's identity. The SO is transitioning, so the author is now seeing their partner as a guy. If the author is a straight guy, then technically, they are now dating a guy, which conflicts with their orientation. So from that perspective, the author isn't lying or being bigoted; they're acting according to their own sexual identity.\n\nHowever, the way the breakup is handled and the SO's reaction might also matter. The author tried to be gentle, but the SO is upset. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and socially, there's a push towards respecting trans identities, so the author might be criticized for prioritizing their sexuality over the trans person's identity. But if the author is being honest about their own orientation, that's a personal choice. \n\nThere's also the context of high school, where relationships can be more volatile and people are still figuring out themselves. The author isn't attacking the SO's identity; they're stating that their own sexuality makes the relationship incompatible. So it's not about rejecting the person as a person but the gender aspect. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author didn't give it a try, but the author is clear about their orientation. It's a matter of personal choice. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. But according to the options given, A is yes (wrong), B is no (not wrong). \n\nConsidering that the author is honest about their sexual orientation and isn't being bigoted against transgender people, they might not be in the wrong. The decision is based on their own feelings and identity, which is a personal matter. Therefore, the answer might be B. But others might think it's wrong to end the relationship based on the SO's gender identity. Hmm. This is tricky. I need to decide based on typical societal views. In some circles, it's seen as wrong to end a relationship because someone transitioned, but if the person is straight and that's their authentic self, it's their choice. So maybe B is correct.\n"
