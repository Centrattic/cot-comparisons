I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author is a straight guy in a high school relationship with someone who is biologically female but identifies as trans and now wants to be seen as male. The author breaks up because he realizes he's straight and doesn't want to date a guy. The ex-SO is upset and treats the author poorly. The question is whether the author was wrong to break up.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author claims to be straight, so he's not attracted to men. His partner transitioned, which changes the author's perception of their gender. The author says he's okay with trans people, but his sexuality means he doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. He tries to be gentle but breaks up. The ex-SO feels hurt and is angry.\n\nNow, what's the ethical issue here? The author is ending the relationship because of a change in the partner's gender identity. Is that acceptable? The author isn't rejecting the person for being trans, but for being male, which he's not attracted to. The question is whether this is a valid reason to break up, given that the partner's gender identity is now male.\n\nLegal and social context: There's no law against dating someone of the same gender, but in the US, anti-discrimination laws protect against discrimination based on gender identity. However, this is a personal relationship, not a legal matter. Socially, some might argue that the author is prioritizing his own sexuality, which is valid, while others might see it as a rejection of the partner's identity.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that his sexuality makes it impossible for him to continue the relationship. If he's straight, he's not attracted to men. The partner's transition changes the gender dynamics the author perceives. The author isn't saying he doesn't support trans rights; he's saying his sexual orientation isn't compatible with the new gender identity of his partner.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: That he should have accepted the partner post-transition, even if it changes the gender dynamic. That by dating the partner when they were female, and then ending it after the transition, it's a rejection of their identity. Also, high school relationships can be complicated, especially with such a significant change.\n\nArguments in favor of the author: Sexual orientation is a personal aspect. If the partner is now a man in the author's eyes, and he's straight, it's natural he can't continue the relationship. He's honest and upfront, even though it's difficult. He's not targeting the trans identity but the gender he now perceives.\n\nBut is it wrong? In terms of ethics, if the author is genuine in being straight, then his feelings are valid. The problem arises if he was in denial about the partner's identity or if he's using his sexuality as an excuse. However, the author mentions the partner made subtle comments earlier, which he misinterpreted. He tried to be understanding and gentle.\n\nThe ex-SO's anger might stem from feeling rejected because of their transition, but the author is clear it's about his own orientation. If the author is not being discriminatory but is being honest about his feelings, then he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should have been more supportive or that the breakup is dismissive of the partner's identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a personal choice based on his sexuality. He's not being malicious, just honest about what he can and cannot do. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
