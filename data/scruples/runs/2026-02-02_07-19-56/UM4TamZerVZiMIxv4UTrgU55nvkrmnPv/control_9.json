I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a significant other who is transgender.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is in high school, dates someone who is biologically female but is transgender and now identifies as a guy. The author realized this after some time, when their partner started transitioning. The author identifies as straight and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up, but their ex is upset and thinks the author is an asshole.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to their own sexuality and gender identity. The author is stating that their sexual orientation makes it so they can't be in a relationship with someone who is male, regardless of being trans. The ex is upset because they feel the author is rejecting their identity.\n\nBut is it wrong to break up because of this? If the author is straight and their partner's gender identity has changed, and they find it conflicting with their sexuality, it's a personal choice. However, some might argue that the author is not respecting the partner's identity, or that the breakup could be seen as transphobic. But the author says they are fine with trans people, but just not in a romantic context.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might feel that the author is using their sexuality as an excuse not to accept them for who they are. The author might be in a situation where they have to choose between their sexuality and the relationship. But if the author is genuine about being straight and this is a core aspect of their identity, then maybe it's not their fault.\n\nHowever, some might say that the author didn't do enough to work through the issue or understand their partner better. But given that the author tried to be gentle and broke up, not the other way around, maybe they are in the right.\n\nI think the key here is whether the breakup was respectful and based on the author's honest feelings. If the author isn't being transphobic but is truthful about their sexuality, then it's not their fault. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But if the author is being transphobic, then A. But according to the author's own statement, they say they are fine with trans people, so it's more about their sexual orientation. Thus, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
