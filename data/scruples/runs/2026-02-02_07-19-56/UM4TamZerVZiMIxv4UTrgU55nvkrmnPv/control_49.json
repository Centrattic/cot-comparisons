I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this scenario. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their partner after finding out they're trans is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is in high school, has been dating their partner for almost a year. The partner is biologically female but identifies as trans and now wants to be referred to as a guy. The author of the post is a straight guy who doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up, and now their ex is upset, so the author is wondering if they're the \"asshole.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's stance on their sexuality and how that affects their decision. The author claims they are straight and that their sexuality makes it so that dating a guy (trans or not) is not something they want. The ex is upset, arguing that the author's feelings shouldn't be about their gender.\n\nNow, considering societal views on transgender individuals and relationships. Transgender people's gender identity is valid, and respecting their identity is important. However, the author's argument is about personal preference related to their sexual orientation. If someone identifies as straight, they might feel they're only attracted to people of a specific gender, and if their partner's gender identity changes, that could conflict with their self-identified orientation.\n\nBut here's the thing: the partner transitioned after the relationship had already been ongoing. The author didn't know about the transition before, so when it happened, their feelings changed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to continue the relationship based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIn terms of ethics and respect, the author isn't being mean for their decision, but they are ending the relationship because of the partner's gender identity. However, the author is also respecting the partner's identity by acknowledging they are trans and using appropriate pronouns. The conflict arises from differing personal preferences and the partner's perspective that the author is prioritizing their own preferences over the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the partner might have felt that the author's decision is based on a misunderstanding of their identity. If the author is okay with trans people in general but not in their own relationship, that could be seen as a personal choice. However, the partner might feel invalidated because their identity is now a barrier.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no right or wrong in terms of personal preference in relationships, but there's a consideration of how the decision is communicated. The author tried to be gentle, which is a positive step. However, the partner's reaction suggests they feel the author is being dismissive or not respecting the relationship's significance.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong hinges on whether personal sexual orientation is a valid reason to end a relationship. Since the author is honest about their feelings and doesn't seem to hold any prejudice against trans people, their decision might be seen as a personal choice rather than wrongdoing. However, the partner's feelings of being treated poorly might make the situation look different from their perspective. But based on the information given, the author's actions align with their self-awareness of their sexuality, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
