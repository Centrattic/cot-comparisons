I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about breaking up with their partner because their partner is trans is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author was dating someone for almost a year, and the partner is biologically female but identifies as trans (now using male pronouns). The author realized they were trans, and the author, identifying as a straight guy, felt it was a problem because their sexuality is towards women. The author broke up, and the partner is upset. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider a few things. The author says they are fine with trans people but don't want to date one because they consider themselves straight. The core issue here is about the author's sexual orientation and how they view their partner's gender identity. \n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, especially considering current discussions around LGBTQ+ rights, it's generally seen that respecting someone's gender identity is important. If someone comes out as trans, the appropriate response is to respect their identity. However, the author's reasoning is based on their own sexuality. They identify as straight, so they might feel they are dating a man now, which conflicts with their orientation towards women. \n\nBut wait, the partner was assigned female at birth. Some people might argue that the author's attraction is to the person regardless of their gender identity, making the breakup about the author's inability to adjust their understanding of their partner's gender. Others might say that if someone identifies as a different gender, then for the author's orientation, it's a mismatch.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the breakup was handled. The author tried to be gentle, which could be seen as considerate. However, the partner feels hurt and treats the author as an asshole. Is the author at fault for prioritizing their own feelings regarding sexuality?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no wrongdoing here. Emotionally, it's complex. The author's decision isn't malicious but based on personal orientation. However, some might argue that the author should be more flexible in their understanding of gender identity. But others might defend the author's right to date based on their own sexual orientation.\n\nI should also think about definitions. Straightness as an orientation typically refers to attraction to the opposite sex. If the partner is now identifying as male, the author sees them as same-sex, which would conflict with their orientation. But there's debate about whether biological sex or gender identity determines that. If the author bases their sexuality on gender identity, then the partner is male now, making the relationship same-sex. If they consider the partner's female biology, it's still opposite-sex. This is a point of contention in some discussions.\n\nIn terms of societal views, respecting someone's gender identity is crucial. So if the author can't accept the partner's identity, that might be seen as a form of rejection. However, the author isn't rejecting the partner for being trans but rather for their own orientation. It's a personal choice, but some may criticize it as not being accepting enough.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They are honest about their feelings and tried to handle it gently. They didn't target their partner for being trans but for not aligning with their own sexuality. On the other hand, some might argue that the author should prioritize their partner's identity over their own initial assumptions. But others might say that the author is acting according to their own truth regarding their sexuality.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether society views the author's decision as a rejection of their partner's identity or a personal choice based on their orientation. Since the author isn't being hostile but is acting on their own feelings, some might say they are not in the wrong. However, others might argue that by ending the relationship based on gender identity, they are contributing to transphobia, even if unintended. But the author claims to be fine with trans people, so it's more about personal compatibility than discrimination.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a decision based on their own sexual orientation and tried to handle it with care. However, there's a valid argument that they should try to adapt, but ultimately, it's their right to date based on their identity.\n"
