I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dates someone they believe is female for a year. The partner starts making subtle comments about feeling more like a guy and then, after a haircut and binding, comes out as trans. The author, identifying as a straight guy, breaks up because it's not what they want. The ex is upset, and the author wonders if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author states they're okay with trans people but don't want to date someone who is trans because they consider themselves straight. So, the issue is about the author's sexuality and how it aligns with their partner's gender identity. The partner, who was biologically female but now identifies as male, is confused why the author's feelings changed.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. In many places, being trans is protected, and discrimination isn't allowed. But this is about personal preference in dating, not legal discrimination. The author is choosing to end the relationship based on their sexual orientation. If the author is indeed straight, then being attracted to someone who is now identifying as a different gender than they were perceived to be might be a valid reason for them. However, some might argue that the author should have known the partner's true identity from the start, but the partner was transitioning and came out later.\n\nAnother angle: The author is in high school, so maybe they're not fully aware of gender identity nuances. The partner didn't fully disclose until after a year. The author tried to handle it gently but ended up breaking up. The ex feels hurt, so the author's action might be seen as hurtful, but is it wrong?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's decision is based on their sexuality, which is a personal choice. However, some might say that the author is prioritizing their own comfort over the relationship, but that's not necessarily wrong. On the other hand, if the author was okay with trans people, why does the gender matter? That could be a point against the author, suggesting inconsistency. But the author says they're straight, so their orientation is about attraction to the gender as perceived, not the biological sex.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally and ethically, you can't force someone to date someone they're not attracted to. But socially, some might judge the author for not accepting the partner's identity. However, the author did break up gently and wasn't hostile. The key is that the author isn't opposing trans rights but is honest about their own sexuality. Therefore, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
