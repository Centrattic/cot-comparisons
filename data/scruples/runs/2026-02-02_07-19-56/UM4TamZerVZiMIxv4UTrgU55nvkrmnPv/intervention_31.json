I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for breaking up with their ex after finding out they're trans. The author identifies as a straight guy, and they were dating someone who is biologically female but now identifies as male. The main issue here is the author's sexuality and how they feel about the gender of their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definitions. If the author is straight, they are attracted to the opposite sex. Since their partner was assigned female at birth but now identifies as male, the author's attraction might be to the person's gender identity, not their biological sex. But the author is saying that their sexuality matters, so they don't want to date someone who is male, trans or not. This brings up questions about whether being transgender affects the author's sexual orientation and whether they're being discriminatory.\n\nNext, the partner might feel that the author is rejecting them because of their gender identity. The author's partner is trans, and the author is choosing to end the relationship based on that. It could be seen as invalidating the partner's identity if the author is focusing on the gender rather than the person. However, the author is honest about their sexuality and isn't pretending to be something they're not.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author tried to let their partner down gently, which shows they were considerate. But the partner is upset and feels wronged. The key here is whether the author's decision is based on genuine feelings of incompatibility due to their orientation or if they're making a judgment based on trans identity.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, some would argue that the author is in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own comfort over accepting their partner's identity. Others might say that people have the right to be honest about their sexuality and that it's not the author's fault if their partner's identity changes in a way that affects the relationship.\n\nI need to remember that this is a complicated situation. The author isn't being malicious; they're being honest about their feelings. However, their partner might see it as a rejection of their identity. The answer might depend on whether you view the author's actions as a legitimate expression of their sexuality or as transphobic.\n\nAlso, considering the high school context, both individuals are young and might not have fully developed their understanding of these issues. The author might not have known how to handle the situation, but they made a decision based on what they believe is right for them.\n\nIn summary, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because they're being honest about their feelings and sexuality. However, the way they handled it could be seen as insensitive, but the core issue is about personal compatibility and sexual orientation. So the answer would lean towards B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
