For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their SO because they're trans is in the wrong. The situation is that the SO transitioned from female to male, and the author, who identifies as a straight guy, decided to break up because he doesn't want to date a guy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The relationship was in high school, they dated for about a year. The SO made subtle comments before transitioning, but the author thought they were misinterpreting. Then the SO came out as trans and asked to be referred to as a guy. The author, being straight, felt it changed the dynamic and broke up. The SO is upset and treating them as an asshole. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom a basic standpoint, being trans is a person's identity. If someone transitions and their gender identity changes, that's part of who they are. The author's sexuality is a factor here. If the author is only attracted to people assigned female at birth, then they're straight. But once their SO is presenting as male (even if biologically female), does that make the author's orientation incompatible?\n\nWait, but the author says they're \"straight,\" which typically means attraction to those assigned male at birth. Wait, no, usually \"straight\" means attraction to the opposite gender. If the SO was assigned female at birth but now identifies as male, and the author is a straight guy (attracted to women), then the author's perspective is that the SO is now male, so they can't be in a relationship anymore. But if the SO's gender identity is male, then from the author's perspective, they're dating a guy now, which conflicts with their sexuality.\n\nHowever, some arguments might be that the author didn't consider the SO's identity and prioritized their own sexuality over the relationship. On the other hand, sexuality is a personal aspect, and people can't be expected to change that. The SO's transition is a significant change, and the author might not be able to reconcile their feelings.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of ethical considerations, if the author is being true to their sexual orientation, that's their right. However, the approach of breaking up and not being able to accept the partner's identity could be seen as invalidating. The SO might feel that the author is rejecting their true self, which can be hurtful. But the author might not be able to help their feelings.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their sexuality. But others might argue that the author should have been more supportive or at least tried to work it out. It's a complex situation where both people's feelings are valid. However, the key point is that the author made a decision based on their own orientation, which is a personal choice, not necessarily a moral failing. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), but there's a lot of nuance here. I need to check if there's a standard on this. Some sources say that being honest about one's sexuality is acceptable, even if it leads to a breakup. So the author isn't at fault for not being able to accept the partner's transition, given their straight identity. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
