I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with their significant other after finding out they're trans. The person (AITA) is a straight guy in high school, and his ex was biologically female but transitioned to male.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The person says they're not against trans people but don't want to date someone who is trans because they're straight. The ex is upset, but the AITA thinks their sexuality makes the gender matter. The question is whether breaking up was wrong.\n\nI remember that being trans is about a person's gender identity, not their biological sex. So if someone was assigned female at birth but identifies as male, they're still the same person. The AITA's issue seems to be with the change in gender identity, but if he was dating them for a year, maybe he was in a relationship with their whole self, including their identity. However, some people have a sexual orientation that's tied to gender, so if he identifies as straight, he might only be attracted to women. But the person he was dating is still the same individual, just with a different gender identity now.\n\nBut wait, if the person transitioned, their gender identity is now male. If the AITA is straight, he might not be into relationships with men, trans or not. So breaking up because his partner's gender identity changed might be seen as valid from his perspective. However, some might argue that the person's gender identity is part of their identity, so if you're in love with someone, you accept all of them. But others might say that sexual orientation is about attraction to certain genders, so if the person's gender changes, it's a valid reason to end the relationship.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the breakup was handled. The AITA says they tried to be gentle, but the ex is upset. The question is whether the reason for breaking up is justified. If the person is trans, and the AITA is straight, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might say that the person's gender identity shouldn't affect the relationship if they were in love. But it's also about personal preferences and sexual orientation.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that being trans is about identity, not about changing the person into someone new. If the AITA was in love with the person as a woman, but they transitioned to man, he might feel it's a mismatch. But others might say that the person is the same person, just with a different gender, so it's invalid to break up. However, it's possible that his sexual orientation is about being attracted to women, not to the person regardless of gender. So from his point of view, it's a valid reason. But society might expect him to accept the person as they are, regardless of gender identity. However, that's a complex issue. \n\nAlso, the AITA is not being transphobic, just stating his preference. If the person is trans, they are still a person, and the breakup is about compatibility. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he's being honest about his feelings. But others might argue that he should adjust his views. I'm a bit torn here. The answer could depend on the perspective\u2014whether the reason for the breakup is valid based on his sexuality. If his sexuality is defined by gender, then the breakup makes sense. But if the argument is that trans people are the same person, then the breakup could be seen as wrong. But the AITA seems to be okay with trans people in general, so it's more about his own orientation. In that case, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
