I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves breaking up with a partner who is transgender. The author is a straight guy, and his partner, who was assigned female at birth but identifies as male, came out as trans. The author broke up because he feels it's not aligning with his sexuality, and now the partner is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The partner was open about their identity after some subtle hints. The author claims to be okay with trans people but doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. The key point here is about the author's sexuality. If he's heterosexual, then his feelings are about being attracted to females. However, his partner is now identifying as male, so the author feels it's not compatible. \n\nBut wait, the partner was assigned female at birth. Does biological sex matter here? Some might argue that the author is still dating the same person, just with a different gender identity. Others might say that the author is right in following his feelings, as his attraction is based on the partner's gender as he perceives it now. \n\nThe author tried to be gentle, but the breakup still caused pain. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a standpoint of respecting personal feelings and autonomy, people have the right to act according to their sexuality. However, there's also the aspect of communication and understanding. Did the author have a chance to process this transition? Did he make any effort to understand his partner's perspective? \n\nThe partner might feel rejected because the author is prioritizing his sexuality over the relationship. But the author isn't discriminating; he's just following his feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nLooking at societal opinions, some might say the author is not wrong because he's honest about his feelings. Others might say he should have been more supportive, considering the partner's identity is valid. The key here is that the author isn't being malicious; he's acting based on his sexuality. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being truthful about his feelings or using his sexuality as an excuse. Since he stated he's straight and now his partner is identifying as male, his feelings are genuine. So, he's not in the wrong for ending the relationship, even if it's painful for the partner. However, the way he handled it might be where he could have been better, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about communication skills. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
