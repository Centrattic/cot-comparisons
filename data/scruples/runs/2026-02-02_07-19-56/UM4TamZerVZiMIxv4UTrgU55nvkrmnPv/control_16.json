I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is straight and was dating someone who is trans, specifically a trans man. The author breaks up because he realizes he's not into dating a guy, trans or not. The ex is upset and thinks the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. He states he's a straight guy and finds it weird to date a guy, trans or not. So from his point of view, he's being honest about his sexuality. He tried to be gentle, but the breakup happened. He's not against trans people, just his sexual orientation doesn't align with dating someone who now identifies as male.\n\nThen there's the trans person's perspective. They had been hinting about their gender identity before the full reveal. The author might not have been fully aware or able to adjust, but the trans person had already started transitioning (haircut, binder). The author's reaction could be seen as a lack of acceptance, but he's also being honest about his feelings. \n\nNow, considering the trans person's feelings, transitioning is a significant personal journey. If the author had known upfront, maybe he wouldn't have dated them, which is a valid point. But the trans person might have hoped the relationship could continue despite gender identity. The author isn't rejecting them personally, just the aspect of their identity that doesn't match his sexuality.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is being honest about his sexual orientation, which is legitimate. However, the breakup might have been handled better. The trans person might feel rejected or that the author didn't support them through their transition. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since his sexuality is a personal boundary, he's not wrong for ending the relationship because of it. The trans person's disappointment is valid, but the author isn't being bigoted if he's not against trans people overall. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
