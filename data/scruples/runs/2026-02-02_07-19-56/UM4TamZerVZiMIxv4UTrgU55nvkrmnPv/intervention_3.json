I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The person is a straight guy who's been dating someone biologically female for a year. The partner came out as trans, and the author broke up because they don't want to date a guy. They're getting flak from their ex for being an asshole and are unsure if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in high school, so they might not have a fully formed understanding of gender identity or sexual orientation. The partner transitioned, and the author feels their sexuality (being straight) makes the relationship incompatible now. \n\nThe key points here are about personal beliefs, consent, and mutual respect. The author isn't being transphobic, but their understanding of their own sexuality is leading them to conclude the relationship isn't sustainable. The partner, on the other hand, might feel disrespected if they believe the author is rejecting their identity. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships are about mutual compatibility. If one person's identity or orientation changes in a way that the other finds incompatible, it's their right to end the relationship. However, the author's approach in \"letting them down gently\" might be questioned. Did they communicate clearly and with empathy? The partner might feel that the author didn't make an effort to understand or adjust, especially if transitioning wasn't discussed earlier. \n\nBut the author's stance is that their sexuality is fixed, and they can't date a man. That's a personal choice. They might not be in the wrong for that, but the way they handled it could matter. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling invalidated, which is a common response when someone's identity is rejected.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. If they respected the partner's identity but couldn't reconcile it with their own orientation, then breaking up isn't inherently wrong. However, if the author's actions were hurtful or dismissive, that could tip the scales. The fact that the author tried to be gentle suggests they're not malicious, but the partner still feels wronged.\n\nI think the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author's decision is based on their own sexuality, which they can't control. However, there's a nuance where they could have approached the breakup with more sensitivity. But ultimately, their decision isn't about the partner's identity being wrong\u2014it's about their own feelings. So maybe they aren't in the wrong, but there's room for growth in how they handle such situations.\n"
