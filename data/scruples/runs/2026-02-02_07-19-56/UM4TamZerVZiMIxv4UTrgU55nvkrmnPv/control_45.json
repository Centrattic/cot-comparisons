I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with their significant other after finding out they're trans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they're straight and that their SO is biologically female but now identifies as male. The SO came out as trans, and the author decided to break up, explaining it's because of their sexuality. The SO is upset and calls the author an asshole.\n\nNow, I have to think about the ethical aspects. The author is being honest about their feelings and sexuality. They mention they're fine with trans people but not with dating someone who is trans because they're straight. The main question is whether this decision makes them wrong.\n\nIn terms of respect and consent, the author is not being openly discriminatory. They're stating their personal preferences. However, there's a nuance here. If the author was dating someone who they believed was a woman and later found out the person is trans, does that change their sexual orientation compatibility? Some people might argue that if the SO was always a man (trans) but the author only found out later, then the breakup might be about discovery rather than choice. But the author says the SO was biologically female, implying they were assigned female at birth. So, the relationship was with a person who is trans but was perceived as a woman during the relationship. \n\nWait, the author says the SO is biologically female. So, the author was in a relationship with someone they believed to be a woman, and the SO later transitioned. The author's issue is not with trans people but with being in a relationship with a man. Since the author is straight, they are only attracted to women. If the SO transitioned to male, then the author's attraction is no longer there. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is honest about their feelings. However, there's a potential for misunderstanding. The SO might have felt that the author was only interested in them as a woman, but the author might have thought they were in a relationship with a woman. The key here is whether the author is being discriminatory. If the author is okay with trans people but just not attracted to men (trans or not), then their decision is based on their sexuality. However, some might argue that if the person was always a man (i.e., transitioned before the relationship), then the breakup could be seen differently. But in this case, the transition happened after the relationship started. \n\nLegally and ethically, discrimination based on gender identity is wrong. But the author is not denying rights or being hateful; they're stating their personal preferences. However, there's a debate about whether straight people can be attracted to trans people if they are in their current gender. The author's position is that they are only attracted to women, so if the SO is now a man, the attraction is gone. \n\nBut some might argue that the author's sexuality is not fixed if the person they were dating was always a man in terms of identity, even if biologically female. The author's decision might be seen as invalidating the SO's identity. However, the author is being honest and isn't being cruel. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the SO transitioned after the relationship started, and the author's sexual orientation is only towards women, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship. However, the way it's handled matters. The author tried to be gentle. The SO's reaction might be more about rejection than the author being wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author is not being discriminatory but making a personal choice based on their sexuality. However, there's a gray area. The author's reasoning is based on their own orientation, which is valid, but some might see it as a form of discrimination. But in the context of personal choice and not being malicious, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
