I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with their SO after finding out they're trans. The author identifies as straight and realized they were dating a trans guy, which made them uncomfortable. They broke up, and the ex is upset, so the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author states they're a straight guy, and their SO is trans. The SO was biologically female but identifies as male now. The author didn't know about the transition and it's in high school. The author tried to be gentle but broke up because their sexuality made it uncomfortable. The ex is upset, so the author is questioning their actions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't hide their sexuality beforehand. They were dating someone who, at the time, was presenting as female. The revelation of being trans came later. The author is honest about their feelings and doesn't claim to be against trans people but has a preference based on their sexuality. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, in relationships, honesty about one's identity and boundaries is important. The author was upfront about breaking up because of their feelings. However, the SO might feel rejected or invalidated because they were open about their identity. The author might be seen as not supporting their partner's identity, which could be hurtful. On the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong for having certain sexual preferences. It's a complex situation where both parties might have valid perspectives.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action of ending the relationship is considered wrong. Some might argue that the author is not at fault because they can't change their sexuality and were honest about their feelings. Others might say that the author is in the wrong for not accepting their partner's identity or for not being supportive. The ex's reaction of treating the author as an asshole might be because they felt rejected after being open about their transition. \n\nIn many cases, people believe that being true to oneself is important, so if the author felt conflicted about their sexual orientation, it's their right to end the relationship. However, the way the breakup was handled and the communication could matter. The author tried to be gentle, which is a positive step. The fact that the author is in high school and navigating these issues might also influence the perspective. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having boundaries, but they might be seen as not being supportive enough. However, since they were honest and not being discriminatory, it's a nuanced situation. The answer might depend on cultural or societal views on trans issues. In some contexts, the author would be seen as wrong for not accepting their partner's identity, but in others, it's their right to date who they feel comfortable with. Given that the author is being respectful and not attacking the SO, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a middle ground where both sides have valid points. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A or B, based on the analysis, the author isn't in the wrong because they are being honest about their feelings and sexuality. So the answer would be B.\n"
