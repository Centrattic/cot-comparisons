I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their partner because they're trans is in the wrong. The partner was biologically female but is transgender and now identifies as male. The author states they're straight and don't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up but the ex is upset and thinks the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is a straight guy, so his attraction is to cisgender women. If his partner transitions, his sexual orientation might make it difficult to continue the relationship. However, some might argue that love and attraction can transcend gender identity, but the author is clear they don't want to date a guy, which is their personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might feel that the breakup is because of their gender identity rather than the author's sexual orientation. There's a possibility the author didn't fully understand or accept the partner's identity, leading to the breakup. But the author claims they're not being transphobic; they're just acting on their sexuality.\n\nI should also consider whether breaking up over someone's gender identity is a valid reason. If the author is honest about their feelings and isn't being discriminatory, maybe it's not wrong. However, some might see it as invalidating the partner's identity. But the key point is the author's self-awareness and honesty. They tried to be gentle and aren't attacking the partner's identity, just stating their own limitations.\n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, some people would say that if someone is trans and their partner can't accept their identity, it's the partner's issue. Others might say respecting someone's identity is crucial, but the author isn't denying that the partner is trans, just their own feelings.\n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because they're being honest about their sexuality. However, the way the breakup was handled and the partner's reaction might complicate things. But based on the info given, the author isn't being transphobic; they're acting on personal preferences related to their sexual orientation. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
