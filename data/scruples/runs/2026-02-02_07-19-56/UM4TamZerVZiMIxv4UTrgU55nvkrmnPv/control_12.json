I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for breaking up with their significant other after finding out they're trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're in high school, dating for nearly a year. The SO is biologically female but identifies as male now. The author is a straight guy who doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. He broke up because his sexuality matters to him. The SO is upset, and the author is questioning if he was wrong.\n\nI need to consider several angles. Legally and ethically, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal in many places, but this is a personal relationship, not a legal matter. The key here is consent and mutual understanding. Did the author know the SO's gender identity before the relationship? The SO mentioned subtle hints but didn't come out until later. The author might not have known, but once they did, the decision to break up is personal.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's straight and doesn't want to date a guy. However, the SO was female-assigned-at-birth and is transitioning. The author's discomfort is about identity, but it's important to note that gender identity is a core part of a person. Some people might argue that the author should accept the person as they are, while others might see it as a personal choice regarding attraction.\n\nIt's also about respect. The author tried to be gentle, which shows consideration. But by ending the relationship, is he being disrespectful? Or is it a matter of personal preference? The line between being in the wrong and making a personal decision is thin here. The SO's reaction might be hurtful, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that doesn't align with his sexuality.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is prioritizing his own sexuality over the person's identity, which could be seen as invalidating. But others might say that people have the right to their sexual orientation and make decisions based on it. So, the answer could hinge on cultural and personal values. In many modern contexts, supporting someone's gender identity is emphasized, but personal choice in relationships is also a factor.\n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't being malicious; he's acting based on his understanding of his sexuality. While the SO might feel rejected, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship, as long as he's respectful. So the answer might be B, but there's nuance. However, the user wants a yes or no. Given that, and considering that the author's actions are based on his own sexual orientation, which is a personal matter, the answer is B.\n"
