I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their SO because they're trans is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a straight guy dating someone who is biologically female but is now identifying as trans and wants to be referred to as a guy. The author broke up because their sexuality makes them only interested in women, so they can't date a guy, trans or not. The ex is upset and treating them as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited, especially in contexts like employment or public services. However, dating is a personal choice and not covered by anti-discrimination laws in the same way. So legally, the author isn't breaking any laws by choosing not to date someone based on their gender identity if they identify as straight.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The author isn't being transphobic if they accept trans people in general but personally aren't interested in dating someone who is a different gender. However, some might argue that the author is invalidating the person's gender identity by ending the relationship solely based on that. The person might feel that their identity is being rejected. On the other hand, the author is honest about their sexuality and not pretending to be something they're not.\n\nThe key points are: the author didn't act out of hatred or prejudice but based on their own sexual orientation. They tried to be gentle. The breakup is about personal compatibility rather than mistreatment. However, the ex's reaction could be due to feeling rejected or not accepted. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author is being truthful about their feelings and isn't acting with malice, they might not be in the wrong. But some might say that staying in the relationship despite the change in gender identity could be more supportive. However, if the author's sexuality is genuine, they can't be forced to stay in a relationship that no longer aligns with their identity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because it's about personal choice and self-awareness. They're not being transphobic but are making a decision based on their own sexuality.\n"
