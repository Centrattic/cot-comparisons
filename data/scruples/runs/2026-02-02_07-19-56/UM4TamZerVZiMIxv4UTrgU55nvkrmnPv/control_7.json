I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The context is that they're both in high school, the author dates them for a year, and the partner is biologically female but identifies as trans. The author is straight and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. The partner is upset and treating the author as an asshole. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They say they're straight, so they don't want to date a guy. The partner is trans and wants to be seen as male, so the author feels their sexuality is incompatible. The partner argues that the author likes them regardless of gender, but the author believes their sexuality makes the gender relevant.\n\nNow, gender identity is a key point here. The partner identifies as a man, so they might feel that the author's issue is not about the person they are but about gender identity. The author's argument is that since they're straight, they can't date someone who is male, even if that person is trans. But some might argue that trans men are men and that the author's issue is not about the person they're dating but their gender, which could be seen as invalidating the partner's identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did break up because of their own feelings and sexuality. They tried to be gentle. But maybe the problem is that the author didn't consider the partner's identity and how the breakup might be perceived as rejecting them entirely, not just their gender. Trans people often face invalidation of their identity, so the partner might feel that the author is not accepting them as they are now.\n\nLegally and socially, people are entitled to their gender identity, and the author's choice to end the relationship based on that might be seen as not respecting their partner's identity. However, the author is also within their rights to choose who they want to date based on their sexuality. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize one's own sexuality over a partner's gender identity.\n\nThe partner's reaction might be due to feeling rejected or invalidated. So from a social justice perspective, the author's action could be seen as wrong because it's based on the partner's gender identity, which is a fundamental aspect of who they are. The author's stance might be considered transphobic, even if they mean it's about being straight. Because if you accept that the partner is a man, then the author is choosing not to date a man, which aligns with their sexuality but the partner's gender is valid. However, some might argue that it's not wrong to date based on one's orientation, but others would say that trans people deserve to be accepted as their gender.\n\nSo the answer could be nuanced. But according to many perspectives, supporting someone's gender identity is important, and the author's decision might be seen as invalidating that, making them in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But if the author is honest about their feelings and doesn't hate the partner, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Considering the broader societal understanding of gender identity, the author's choice to end the relationship due to the partner's gender might be seen as not respecting their identity, so they are in the wrong.\n"
