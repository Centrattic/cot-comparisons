I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their SO after finding out they're trans. The author identifies as a straight guy, and their ex is biologically female but now identifies as a guy. The key points here are about the author's sexuality and the nature of the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are straight, so they are naturally attracted to women. Their SO transitioned, so the author's attraction might have shifted. But the SO was biologically female all along. So maybe the author's issue isn't with the trans identity itself but with the change in gender identity, which they can't reconcile with their straight sexuality.\n\nThe author tried to be gentle but ended up breaking up. The ex is upset and treating them as an asshole. The question is whether the author is wrong. \n\nI need to consider if the author has a right to their feelings about their sexuality. If being straight means they are only attracted to women, and their SO is now identifying as a guy, then the author's decision is based on their own sexual orientation. It's not about the trans identity per se, but about their own preferences. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have known about the SO's gender identity earlier, especially since there were subtle comments before. But the author says they misinterpreted them. Also, the SO didn't disclose before the transition steps. The author might have a right to their feelings, even if they're not comfortable with the change. \n\nOn the other hand, if the SO was biologically female and the author was dating them as a woman, then transitioning to male could change the dynamic. But the author's issue is with dating a guy, which is their sexuality. So the author isn't in the wrong for acting on their own sexual preferences. \n\nThe answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a decision based on their own sexuality, even if it's difficult. The key is that the author isn't rejecting the trans identity but their own attraction. The breakup isn't malicious but about personal orientation.\n"
