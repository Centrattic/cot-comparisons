For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a guy in high school who's been dating someone for almost a year. The ex-disclosed they're trans, specifically biologically female but identifying as male now. The author, identifying as straight, breaks up because he doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. The ex is upset and treating them like an asshole, leading the author to question if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault here. The key points here are about consent, respect, and understanding of trans identities. The author says they're okay with trans people but not dating one because they're straight. The ex argues that the author likes them as a person, so why does their gender matter. \n\nFrom a general standpoint, being trans is about the individual's identity, not just their biological sex. The author is choosing to end the relationship based on the person's gender identity, which is a core aspect of who they are. The author claims it's about their sexuality, but if they're straight, they are only attracted to women. However, the trans person in this case has a male gender identity. So, the author's reasoning is that since they're straight, they can't be in a relationship with someone who identifies as male. \n\nBut here's the thing: attraction is personal, and people's orientations can vary. However, the key here is whether the author's decision is valid. The author isn't discriminating out of malice but based on their own feelings of not being attracted to men. However, the trans person might see this as the author rejecting them as a person, not just their gender. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's identity is crucial. The author is aware of the person's trans status and chooses to end the relationship. The ex's reaction might be hurt because the author's decision is based on their own sexual orientation, which is valid for the author, but the ex might feel it's a rejection of their identity. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). In many cases, people's decisions based on their own orientations are seen as valid, even if others might feel hurt. However, there's a nuance here with trans identities. If the author was aware of the person's trans status before the relationship started or during it, but chose to continue and then broke up after the disclosure, that might be seen differently. \n\nIn this case, the author mentions they had subtle comments but thought they misinterpreted. The person came out as trans after a year. The author's decision to break up is based on their own orientation. However, some might argue that the author was in the relationship with a trans person all along and only realized their orientation after the fact. Others might say the author is being honest about their feelings and that it's not their fault. \n\nBut there's a potential issue here with the author's understanding of their own orientation. If the author was in a relationship with a trans man (biologically female but identifying as male) and only realized their orientation after the person transitioned, that might indicate the author's orientation is more about gender identity than biological sex. This could be a point of confusion. \n\nHowever, the author is clear that they identify as straight, which typically means attraction to the opposite sex. If the person's gender identity is male, then from the author's perspective, they are no longer seeing them as a woman. But the author was in a relationship with them for a year before the person came out as trans. This could suggest that the author's orientation is more about gender identity than biological sex, which complicates things. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author is being honest about their feelings and breaking up for personal reasons. However, some might argue that the author should have been more understanding, especially since the person's identity is a fundamental part of who they are. The ex's anger might stem from feeling that their identity is being rejected. \n\nBut the author is not being hostile; they're just not attracted to men. The problem is that the author is now dating someone who identifies as a man, which conflicts with their straight identity. The author's choice is valid, but the ex's reaction is about feeling rejected. \n\nIn the context of AITA, the community often looks at whether the person acted with kindness and respect. The author tried to be gentle, so they might be seen as not in the wrong. However, the ex's hurt feelings are valid too. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're being honest about their orientation and making a tough decision. However, there's a debate here about whether the author should have considered the trans person's identity from the start. But since the author wasn't aware of the person's trans status earlier, their decision after the fact is about their own feelings.\n"
