I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they were in a high school relationship with someone they referred to as their SO, who is biologically female but transitioning to male. The SO came out as trans, and the author ended the relationship because they identify as straight and don't want to date a guy, trans or not. The SO is upset and treating them like an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author is being honest about their sexuality. If they are straight and only attracted to women, then once the SO transitions to male, the author's feelings might change. However, there's a nuance here. The SO was biologically female during the entire relationship. So, if the author is straight, their attraction might have been to the person as a woman, but now the SO is identifying as a man. The author's decision is based on their sexual orientation, which they can't control. But is that a valid reason to break up immediately, or should they wait until the transition is complete?\n\nAlso, the way the breakup was handled. The author tried to be gentle, but the SO is feeling hurt. The key point is that the author didn't know the SO was trans when they started the relationship. Now that they do, they're ending it. But is that fair? Some people might argue that if you're in a relationship, you should accept your partner as they are, including their gender identity. Others might say that if someone's sexual orientation is strictly towards a specific gender, they have the right to end the relationship if that changes, as long as they're respectful.\n\nAnother angle: the SO made subtle comments before the transition. The author might have had the chance to process this earlier but didn't. Maybe they should have asked more questions or supported the SO's transition from the start. However, the SO only explicitly came out a week ago. The author might not have been ready to adjust their understanding of the relationship at that point.\n\nThere's also the aspect of identity. The SO's gender identity is part of who they are. By ending the relationship because of their transition, the author could be seen as rejecting a core part of their partner's identity. That's a tough situation. But the author is also honest about their own feelings and sexuality. They might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship due to a change in their partner's gender, but the way they handled it and the support they provided during the transition could matter.\n\nI should also think about the community norms. In many modern discussions, respecting a person's gender identity is crucial. If the author is ending the relationship because their partner is now a man, even if that's based on their own sexuality, it could be seen as discriminatory. However, the author is clear that they are straight and that their sexuality is the reason. It's about personal orientation, not about the person's identity.\n\nSo, the question is whether it's wrong to break up with a trans person because you're straight. Some might say yes because they're still the same person, just with a different identity. Others might say no, because the author's feelings are genuine and their orientation is part of who they are. The answer might depend on how the community views this. Since the author is in high school, maybe they're not fully aware of the complexities of gender identity and the importance of support. The fact that they tried to be gentle might mitigate some blame, but the decision itself could still be seen as wrong because it's rejecting a trans partner's identity.\n\nBut the author is also being honest. If they realized they can't accept their partner as a man, maybe it's necessary for them to end the relationship. However, some might argue that they should support their partner's transition and adjust their own understanding. The SO's reaction is also important\u2014feeling treated like an asshole might indicate that the breakup was hurtful, regardless of the reasoning. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting on their own sexuality, but the timing and the SO's feelings are factors. I'm a bit torn here. On one hand, respecting the partner's identity is vital. On the other, the author's sexuality is a personal aspect they can't change. Maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they need to be more understanding and considerate of the SO's feelings. However, the community's perspective might lean towards the author being in the wrong for ending the relationship after the transition. I'll go with AITA for the author being in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
