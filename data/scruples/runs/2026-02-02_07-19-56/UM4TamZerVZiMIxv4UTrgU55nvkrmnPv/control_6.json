I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their SO after finding out they're trans. The situation is they've been dating for almost a year, and the SO just came out as trans. The author is a straight guy and feels it's not right for him to date a guy, trans or not. The ex is upset and treating them like an asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is honest about their sexuality and made a decision based on that. They tried to be gentle, but the breakup still happened. The key points are consent, honesty, and mutual respect. The author didn't hide their feelings and acted on their own sexual orientation. The SO might have felt it was a deal-breaker, but the author can't be blamed for their own sexuality.\n\nAlso, societal perspectives matter. Some might argue it's wrong to end a relationship solely based on someone's gender identity, but others might see it as the author being true to themselves. The author isn't rejecting the person as a person but their own feelings. It's important to note that being trans doesn't invalidate the relationship if the author is a straight guy. However, the author's decision is their own, and they aren't in the wrong for acting on their sexuality.\n\nThe SO's reaction could be due to not expecting the breakup, but that doesn't make the author at fault. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
