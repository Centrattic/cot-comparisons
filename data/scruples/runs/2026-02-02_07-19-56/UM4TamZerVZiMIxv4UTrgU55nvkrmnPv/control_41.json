I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who broke up with their partner because they found out their partner is trans is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a straight guy, and their partner, who is biologically female, transitioned and now identifies as male. The author broke up because they said they don't want to date a guy, trans or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. From what I know, in many places, it's illegal to discriminate against someone based on their gender identity. So if the person is ending the relationship because of the partner's gender identity, that might be a problem. But wait, relationships aren't legally binding like employment, so maybe that's different. But ethically, is it wrong?\n\nThe author says they're straight and that they don't want to date a guy. However, the partner was assigned female at birth and is transitioning. The author's sexuality is oriented towards the opposite sex, which here would be female. But since the partner is transitioning, does that change things? The author is ending the relationship because they are uncomfortable with the transition. But the partner is still the same person, just identifying differently. \n\nThen there's the partner's reaction. They feel treated like an asshole. The author tried to be gentle, but the breakup happened. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think it's about consent and mutual respect. The partner came out as trans, and the author realized their feelings were about the person's gender identity. If the author is not comfortable with the transition, then maybe it's not a matter of right or wrong, but a difference in needs. However, some might argue that the author is rejecting the partner's identity, which is a fundamental part of who they are. That could be seen as invalidating the partner's experience, leading to the author being in the wrong. \n\nBut others might say that people have the right to their sexuality and that it's not the author's fault they're not attracted to men. However, if the author is okay with trans people in general but not in this specific case, maybe there's a conflict between accepting the person as they are versus the author's own sexual orientation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions not being sure about pronouns, which shows some lack of understanding. The partner's identity is now male, so using the correct pronouns is important. The author might be struggling with that transition. \n\nIn terms of the question, the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is being honest about their feelings and they're acting in accordance with their own sexuality, some might say they're not in the wrong. But if they're rejecting the partner's identity and causing harm, then they might be. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't wrong for being straight, but they might be wrong for how they handled the breakup. However, the partner's identity is a core part of who they are, so the author might be prioritizing their own comfort over the partner's well-being. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're being truthful about their feelings. However, others might argue that they should have accepted the partner as they are. It's a tough call. I need to check if there's a consensus on this. \n\nIn many cases, people are advised to accept a partner's identity, but if it conflicts with one's own sexuality, it's a personal choice. However, the stigma and potential harm done to the trans partner by the breakup might make the author responsible for not supporting them. \n\nSo considering all that, I think the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're rejecting the partner's identity, which is a fundamental part of who they are, and the author could be seen as not respecting that. But some might say B. Hmm. Let me think again. The author could have tried to work through it if they were open to it. But if they're straight and not interested in men, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a conflict between identities. \n\nI think the correct answer depends on societal views. If society supports people for who they are, then the author is wrong. If it's about individual choice, then maybe not. I'm leaning towards A because the author is rejecting the partner's identity, which is a core aspect, and the partner likely expected acceptance. But the author's sexuality is also a valid aspect. This is really tricky. Maybe B is correct because the author isn't in the wrong for being who they are. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up. If the partner is trans and the author is straight, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their sexuality. But if the author is rejecting the partner's gender identity, that's where the problem is. \n\nThe partner is now identifying as male, so if the author is straight, they're not attracted to males. So the author is ending the relationship because the partner's gender changed. But the partner was always the same person; the identity is just recognized now. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not accepting the partner's identity. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they're rejecting their partner's identity, which is a fundamental part of who they are. The author should have accepted them as they are, regardless of their own sexuality.\n"
