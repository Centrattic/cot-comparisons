For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The person is a high school student who's been dating their SO for almost a year. The SO is biologically female but transitioned, and the author broke up because they're straight. The SO is upset and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is straight and doesn't want to date someone who is trans, which the SO is now. The author says they're fine with trans people but not with dating one. The SO is upset and thinks the author is an asshole. The author is wondering if they're wrong.\n\nNow, thinking about sexuality and identity. Being straight means being attracted to the opposite sex, so if the SO is now identifying as male, the author might feel that their sexuality doesn't align. However, the SO was always the same person, just with a different gender identity. The author might not be considering that the person's identity is now as a man, so their attraction might not be about the person's gender per se but about the person's essence. But the author is insistent that their sexuality makes it matter.\n\nAlso, the author says they tried to be gentle but still broke up. The SO is in pain, which is common in breakups. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because of the SO's gender identity. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, respecting someone's identity is important. So if the author is ending the relationship solely because the SO is trans, that could be seen as invalidating the SO's identity. Even if the author is straight, their attraction is based on the person's identity. However, some might argue that sexuality is a personal preference and that the author isn't obligated to change their orientation. \n\nBut there's a line between personal preference and discrimination. If the author is okay with trans people in general but not in a dating context, that could be seen as discriminatory. The SO might feel that the author is using their sexuality as an excuse to end the relationship without considering the SO's feelings.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and empathy. The author's intention was to break up because of their sexuality, but they might not have communicated it in a way that acknowledged the SO's feelings. The SO's reaction is valid because such a breakup can be hurtful. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because their feelings are genuine and they're acting on their sexuality. However, others might see it as the author is in the wrong (A) for prioritizing their orientation over the relationship, even if it's not their fault. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is respecting the SO's identity. If the author is treating the SO as a man and is still attracted to them, maybe their issue is with the transition itself. But if the author is okay with trans people in general but not in a dating context, that's a different angle. The author's reasoning is that their sexuality (being straight) means they can't date a guy, trans or not. If the SO is now identifying as a man, then from the author's perspective, it's a mismatch in sexual orientation. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their feelings and sexuality. However, others might argue that the author should have considered the SO's feelings more and perhaps stayed in the relationship if there's still mutual affection. But the author has the right to their own preferences. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is acting based on their own sexuality and communicated it as best as they could, even if the SO is hurt. The fault isn't necessarily on the author for having those feelings, though they could have handled it more sensitively.\n"
