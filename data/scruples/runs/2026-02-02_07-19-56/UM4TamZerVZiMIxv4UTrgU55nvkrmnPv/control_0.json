I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their SO after finding out they're trans. The situation is that the SO is biologically female but identifies as male. The author is a straight guy and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. The SO is upset and accuses the author of being an asshole. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications here. The author is not being cruel or bigoted; they state they're fine with trans people but their sexuality is straight. So they don't want to date a man, whether cis or trans. The breakup wasn't because of the person's identity but their own sexual preferences.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility is key. If one person's identity changes in a way that affects the other's ability to be in the relationship, it's reasonable to end it. The author tried to be gentle, so they're not being malicious. However, some might argue that the author should be more accepting, but the author is clear that their orientation is a factor. It's a matter of personal choice and honesty.\n\nThe SO might feel rejected or hurt, but the author isn't wrong if they're honest about their feelings. The key point is whether the author is being discriminatory. Since the author isn't opposing trans people but their own preferences, it's not discrimination. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
