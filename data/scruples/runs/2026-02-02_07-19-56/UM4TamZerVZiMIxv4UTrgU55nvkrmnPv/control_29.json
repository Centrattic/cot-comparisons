I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong after breaking up with their SO when the SO came out as trans. The author mentions they're a straight guy, and since their SO is biologically female but identifies as male now, they don't want to date a guy. The SO is upset, and the author is confused if they're an a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's SO transitioned, and the author realized they were straight and not interested in dating a male, trans or not. The author tried to be gentle but ended up breaking up. The SO is upset, but the author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the dynamics here. The author claims to be okay with trans people in general but their sexuality doesn't align with the SO's gender identity. So, the author's decision is based on their own sexual orientation. Is that a valid reason? The SO might feel rejected or that their identity is being disregarded. The author might be seen as prioritizing their own preferences over the relationship, but if their sexuality is genuine, that's part of who they are.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance here. The author didn't break up because of the transition itself but because of their own sexual orientation. The SO might feel that the author didn't make an effort to adjust, but if the author is straight and can't change that, then they're not at fault. However, some might argue that the author didn't support their partner through the transition, which could be seen as insensitive, even if the reason is their sexuality. \n\nAlso, considering the high school context, both might be young and still figuring out things. The author might not have known how to handle the situation, leading to a breakup. The key point is that the author's choice is based on their sexuality, which is a personal preference, not malice. But the SO's reaction might be about feeling invalidated. \n\nI need to check if the author's reasoning is valid. If being straight is genuine, then the author isn't wrong for not wanting to date a male person. However, the way the breakup was handled could be a factor. The author said they tried to be gentle, but maybe there's room for more empathy. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not about the method of the breakup.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that both are acting on their authentic selves. The author is honest about their sexuality, while the SO is honest about their identity. The breakup is a result of conflicting identities. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being who they are, even if it ends the relationship.\n"
