I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with their partner who is trans. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in high school, dating someone who is biologically female but identifies as male and is now using male pronouns. The author isn't comfortable dating a guy, even if they're trans, because they consider themselves straight. They broke up, and now their ex is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are about identity, sexual orientation, and consent. The partner came out as trans, and the author felt that their sexuality meant they couldn't continue the relationship. The author claims they tried to be gentle but had to break up. The ex is upset, calling the author an asshole.\n\nNow, considering general societal views on trans rights, people's gender identity is respected. But the author's issue isn't about respecting their identity\u2014it's about their own sexual orientation. If the author is straight and only dates women, and their partner is now identifying as male, then from a personal choice standpoint, maybe the author is not wrong for realizing they can't be in a relationship with a man. However, the way it's handled matters. Did the author give the partner enough time to process this? Did they communicate effectively?\n\nThe author says they tried to be gentle. But the partner might feel rejected based on their gender identity, which could be seen as invalidating their identity. However, the author is stating their own sexual orientation as the reason. So, it's a matter of personal choice. If someone is straight and their partner transitions, the person's feelings might change. That's a complex situation.\n\nBut legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong for their sexual orientation. However, in some contexts, people might argue that staying in a relationship should trump personal insecurities or that the author should be more flexible. But the author isn't saying they're transphobic; they're just stating their sexuality. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner might have felt that the author didn't support their identity, leading to the breakup. So, the question is whether the author is wrong for acting according to their own sexuality or if they should have worked through it. It's a nuanced situation. \n\nIn many cases, people accept that others have different orientations and identities. Here, the author isn't refusing to accept the partner's identity but is acknowledging their own. The problem is that the partner might feel that the breakup is a rejection of their identity. However, the author's choice is personal. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're acting according to their own sexuality, but it's a sensitive issue. The answer might be B (No), but it's a close call. However, given that the author isn't being transphobic and is honest about their feelings, they might not be at fault.\n"
