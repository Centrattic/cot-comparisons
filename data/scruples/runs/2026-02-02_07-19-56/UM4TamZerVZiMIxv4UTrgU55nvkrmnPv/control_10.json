I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their significant other after finding out they're trans. The author mentions they're a straight guy, and since their SO is biologically female but now identifies as male, they feel it's not right for them. The SO is upset and treating them as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited, especially in contexts like employment or public services. However, this is a personal relationship, not a legal matter. The author is choosing to end a romantic relationship based on their sexuality. \n\nThe author states they're straight and don't want to date someone who is trans. But being transgender is about a person's gender identity, not their biological sex. If the author's SO was assigned female at birth but identifies as male, some people might consider them male in terms of gender identity. However, the author's orientation is towards the gender of the person they're attracted to. If the author is only attracted to cisgender women, then they might feel this is a mismatch. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author's SO was their partner for a year. The author might not have known their gender identity before. Now, they're choosing to end the relationship. The question is whether this decision is valid. Some might argue that the author is not wrong because their sexuality is a personal choice. Others might say that trans individuals are men or women depending on their identity, and thus the author's decision is based on incorrect assumptions. \n\nAlso, the author tried to be respectful, using they/them pronouns initially and explaining their reasoning. They tried to be gentle. The ex is upset, but the author's position is about personal feelings and sexuality. \n\nI need to check if there's any ethical obligation here. Since it's a breakup, the author has the right to end the relationship for personal reasons. However, some might argue that rejecting a trans person based on their identity could be discriminatory if the person is otherwise the same as a cisgender person in terms of the author's attraction. But the author is clear that their orientation is an issue here. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions may not be wrong in terms of personal choice, but some might view it as discriminatory. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and there's no legal wrong here, the answer might be B (No), as the author is acting on their own feelings and sexuality, which are personal and not illegal or unethical. However, the sensitivity of the situation and the trans person's feelings are important. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, which is more about right and wrong rather than empathy.\n"
