I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up with a partner who is trans. The author is a straight guy, and his SO is biologically female but identifies as a guy. He didn't want to date a guy, trans or not, so he broke up. The SO is upset, calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is being honest about his sexuality. He's straight, so he's not interested in dating men. His partner's gender identity changed, which made him realize they're not compatible. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is acting based on his own sexual orientation. If he's straight and his partner is now identifying as male, then in his view, their relationship is no longer within his sexual preferences. But the question is whether that makes him in the wrong. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of when the partner's identity was revealed. The partner had been making subtle comments about feeling more like a guy before the hair cut and binder. The author might have had some clues but didn't act on them. Did the partner feel they had to transition in a certain way to be authentic, and the author was okay with the biological sex but not the new gender identity?\n\nThe author claims he's not bigoted, just straight. But maybe the issue is that the partner was already in a relationship with someone who was presenting as female, and the author didn't mind that. The transition might have changed the author's perspective, but does that make him in the wrong? It's a bit of a moral dilemma. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his feelings and sexuality. On the other, the partner might feel rejected after transitioning, which is a significant part of their identity. The author might be seen as using his sexuality as a reason to leave after the partner started transitioning, even if he was okay with them as they were before. That could be seen as invalidating the partner's identity. \n\nBut the author is also not obligated to change his sexual orientation. If he's straight and not interested in men, then the relationship was based on a premise that no longer holds. However, the author could have handled it more sensitively or tried to understand. The partner might have expected more support during their transition. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether the author's actions were unjust. If the author is being truthful about his feelings and sexuality, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he dismissed the partner's identity or was insincere, then he might be. The key points are honesty, respect for the partner's identity, and whether the breakup was a result of the author's genuine feelings or prejudice. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess based on the information given. The author claims to be okay with trans people but not interested in dating a guy. That seems to align with his sexuality. However, the partner might have felt that their identity was the main reason for the breakup, which can be hurtful. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is following his sexuality and being honest, even if it's uncomfortable. But there's a nuance where the partner's transition might have been a factor, but the author isn't obligated to change his preferences.\n"
