I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The situation is that the author is a straight guy, and his partner is a trans guy. He broke up because he doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and ethical aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is against the law, especially in contexts like employment or housing. But this is about a personal relationship, not a legal matter. So maybe that's not the main point here.\n\nNext, societal viewpoints. There's a lot of emphasis now on respecting people's gender identity. The author's partner came out as trans, so the expectation would be to respect their identity, including pronouns and presentation. The author is okay with trans people in general but not with dating a trans man. That seems like a personal choice, but is it wrong?\n\nThe partner is upset, thinking the author is an asshole. From the author's perspective, he's being honest about his sexuality. If he identifies as straight and attracted to women, and his partner is a trans man, then he's not interested in men, including trans men. But some might argue that trans men are men, so it's a contradiction. However, the author's understanding of his own sexuality is central here.\n\nAnother angle: respect and communication. The author tried to let them down gently. That's a good point. The breakup wasn't sudden or harsh. However, the partner might feel hurt because it feels like rejection based on their identity, not the person they are. The author might be seen as not accepting their partner's true self, which can be hurtful.\n\nBut the author isn't saying he's against trans people; he's just not interested in dating a man. It's about personal preference. However, some might argue that if the author was okay with them as a woman and is now okay with them as a man, the breakup is based on the partner's gender, which is a form of discrimination. But if the author's sexuality is strictly heterosexual, then this could be a genuine conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't being hostile towards trans people, but his decision is based on their gender identity. If the partner feels that the author is rejecting them as a person, that's a valid emotional response. However, the author is also being honest about his own feelings and sexuality, which is important in relationships.\n\nSo, depending on the perspective, some might say the author is wrong for not accepting their partner's identity, while others might say he's not in the wrong for being true to his own sexuality. The answer likely depends on the cultural context and personal beliefs. Since the question is a classic \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), people often debate based on whether the action was respectful and considerate. The author did try to be gentle, but the decision itself could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the author's identity is as a straight guy, it's a matter of personal choice. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't being malicious, but his decision is based on the partner's gender, which could be seen as wrong in the context of respecting someone's identity. So maybe the answer is A, yes, he's in the wrong. But others might say B, not in the wrong because it's about his sexuality. Hmm. Need to decide based on the typical responses to AITA posts. Often, the community might side with respecting the person's identity, so the author's choice could be seen as wrong, making the answer A.\n"
