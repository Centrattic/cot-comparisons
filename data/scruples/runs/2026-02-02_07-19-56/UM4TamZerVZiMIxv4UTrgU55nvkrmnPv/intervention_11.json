I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after the partner came out as trans. The situation involves high school students, so context is important here.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're a straight guy and that their partner is trans. They state that they're not opposed to trans people but don't want to date a guy, trans or not. The partner is biologically female, so the author is essentially saying that their sexual orientation is only towards women, and since the partner is now identifying as male, the author feels the relationship is no longer compatible.\n\nNow, the question is whether this is acceptable. From a general perspective, people's sexual orientations can be complex. If someone identifies as straight and only dates people of the opposite gender, then if their partner transitions, it might create a conflict. But there's also the aspect of respect for the partner's identity. The partner asked to be referred to as a guy, and the author complied, then broke up.\n\nThe author tried to be respectful, but the core issue is that their sexual orientation doesn't align with their partner's gender. However, some might argue that the author is prioritizing their own orientation over the partner's identity. Others might see it as the author being honest about their feelings. \n\nBut wait, the partner had already made subtle comments about feeling more like a guy before the breakup. The author had the chance to process that but didn't act until the transition was more visible. The breakup might be seen as a reaction to the partner's transition rather than a long-standing incompatibility. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is key. If the author knew from the start they only wanted to date women and the partner was transitioning, maybe the breakup is necessary. But since the partner transitioned during the relationship, the author is now dealing with a change. \n\nSome might say the author is in the right because they're true to their sexuality. Others might say they should have been more understanding or stayed to support the partner. However, the author isn't rejecting the partner's identity but the change in gender affecting their relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. The author is not being bigoted but is being honest about their preferences. However, breaking up after the partner has transitioned could be seen as using their orientation as an excuse. But given the information, the author's actions might be justified from their perspective. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
