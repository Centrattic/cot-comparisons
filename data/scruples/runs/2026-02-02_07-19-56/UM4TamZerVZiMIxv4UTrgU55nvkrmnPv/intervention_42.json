I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong after breaking up with their partner because the partner is trans. They mentioned being a straight guy and that they don't want to date a guy, trans or not. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The partner came out as trans, which is a significant part of their identity. The author is saying that their sexuality makes the gender matter, so they broke up. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I know, being trans is about one's gender identity, not their biological sex. The author refers to the partner as biologically female, but if the partner identifies as male now, that's their self-identification. The author's reasoning is based on their own sexual orientation, thinking that since they're straight, they can only date someone of a specific gender. \n\nBut here's the thing: if the partner's gender identity is male, then the author's preference might be about the gender they identify with. However, this could be seen as invalidating the partner's identity. The author is choosing not to continue the relationship based on the partner's gender identity, which the partner has revealed. \n\nSome might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their feelings and sexuality. Others might say that the author is in the wrong because they're rejecting the partner after the partner came out, which could be seen as not accepting their identity. \n\nAlso, the author is in high school, so maybe they're still figuring things out. But the key point is whether the breakup was the right thing to do given the partner's identity. The author tried to be gentle, but the partner is upset. \n\nIn many discussions about relationships and identity, respecting someone's self-identification is crucial. If the author's sexual orientation is strictly towards people of a particular gender, and the partner's identity changes, the author might feel conflicted. But does that make the author wrong for ending the relationship? It's complex. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong if they're being truthful about their feelings and sexuality. However, some might see it as the author not accepting the partner as they are. But I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because it's about personal preferences and honesty in a relationship. However, others might argue that the author should have been more accepting. Hmm.\n"
