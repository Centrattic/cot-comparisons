I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (let's call them Person A) broke up with their significant other (Person B) after finding out that Person B is transgender. Person B is biologically female but identifies as a male now. Person A is a straight guy and realized that dating a male would be weird for them because of their sexuality. They tried to explain that their gender matters to them and ended the relationship, which led to Person B being upset. The question is whether Person A is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Person A and Person B had been dating for almost a year. Person B had made subtle comments about feeling like a guy, but Person A might have misinterpreted those. Then, after Person B transitioned (haircut, binder), they came out as trans. Person A, identifying as straight, couldn't reconcile this and broke up. \n\nNow, the key point here is about Person A's sexuality. If Person A identifies as straight, then they are attracted to people of the opposite gender. Since Person B is now identifying as male, even though their biological sex is female, Person A might feel that their attraction is no longer aligned with their sexuality. But I should check what straight typically means. Straight usually means attraction to the opposite gender. So if Person B's gender is now male, then from Person A's perspective, they might no longer be the opposite gender. That could make sense for Person A's reasoning. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. Person B's biological sex is female, so if Person A was attracted to their biological sex, maybe the issue is more about gender identity versus biological sex. Some people might argue that sexuality is about gender identity, not biological sex. So if Person A is straight, they might be attracted to individuals who identify as the opposite gender, regardless of biological sex. However, others might say that straight typically refers to biological sex. This could vary depending on individual perspectives. \n\nThe problem is that Person A didn't realize Person B's gender identity for most of the relationship. The question is whether it's fair to end the relationship because of a revelation about gender identity after a year. Person A tried to be gentle, but Person B is upset. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong for Person A to end the relationship for reasons of their own sexuality? If Person A is being honest and isn't being discriminatory, just stating their own feelings, then maybe they are in the right. On the other hand, if Person A didn't consider that their own understanding of their sexuality might have been influenced by the previous perception of Person B's gender, and now that the truth is out, they're ending it, that might be seen as using the transition as an excuse, especially if they were already in a committed relationship. \n\nAlso, the way Person A phrased it\u2014\"I don't want to date a guy, trans or not\"\u2014suggests that it's their sexuality that makes them uncomfortable. So if that's the case, then maybe they are not in the wrong because they're being honest about their feelings. However, some might argue that Person A should have been more supportive or that their definition of straight is too rigid. \n\nAnother angle is whether Person A gave enough thought to their feelings before the breakup. For example, did they have discussions about Person B's gender identity earlier? Since they were in a year-long relationship, maybe Person A should have been more open to understanding or adjusting their perspective. But if they truly believe that their sexuality is about the opposite gender and that gender identity is key, then maybe they are justified. \n\nIn some communities, people might see it as the person's right to end the relationship if their romantic feelings are based on the partner's gender identity. Others might think it's hurtful and that Person A should have considered the relationship's longevity and Person B's identity. \n\nI need to consider societal norms. Some might say that Person A is in the right because they are being honest about their feelings, while others might say it's hurtful to end a long-term relationship after this revelation. The answer could depend on cultural or personal beliefs. \n\nBut given the scenario, since Person A is clear about their sexuality and the reason for the breakup, and they didn't act out of malice or prejudice, it's possible they aren't in the wrong. However, if there was a lack of communication or if Person A ignored signs, that could be a point against them. But according to the story, they did ask about the changes and were told the truth. So, the decision was made after that. \n\nI think the key here is that Person A is not being discriminatory but is making a personal choice based on their own sexuality. Therefore, they are not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
