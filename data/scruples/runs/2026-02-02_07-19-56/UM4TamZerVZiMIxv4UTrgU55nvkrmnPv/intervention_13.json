I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their partner after finding out they're trans is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author mentions that they're in high school, and they were dating someone who is biologically female. The partner had been making subtle comments about feeling more like a guy, but the author thought they might be misinterpreting. Then the partner cut their hair and started wearing a binder, and revealed they're trans and want to be referred to as a guy. The author is straight and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up, but the partner is upset and treating them like an asshole.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user who posted this thinks the author is in the wrong but wants the opinion. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the context of the situation. Being trans is about a person's gender identity, which may not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. The person in question is transgender, identifying as a guy. The author is a straight guy, so his attraction is to women. However, the partner is biologically female, which is the same gender identity as the author's original understanding.\n\nNow, when the partner transitioned, the author's feelings changed because his sexuality is such that he doesn't want to date a guy. But here's the catch: the partner's gender identity is a part of who they are. From a modern perspective, respecting someone's identity is crucial. However, the author's straight orientation might mean he's not attracted to men, transgender or not. So does that make him wrong for ending the relationship?\n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to break up based on the partner's gender identity. If the partner was always the same sex, the author would be dating a girl. But once the partner transitioned, the author's feelings changed because he's straight. But maybe the author should recognize that the person is still the same person he was dating, just with a different gender identity. However, the author might feel that his attraction is based on the person's gender, so if that changes, his feelings might not align anymore.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's identity is key. However, the author is also allowed to be honest about his feelings. If the author realized that he can't be in a relationship with a guy, trans or not, then ending the relationship because of his own sexual orientation isn't necessarily wrong. But some might argue that the author should have supported his partner's transition and adjusted, even if it felt different. \n\nAnother angle: when the partner came out as trans, the author had to adjust his understanding of the relationship. If the partner is biologically female and identifies as male, the author might be grappling with the change in presentation. However, the partner's gender identity is valid, so the author's issue is with his own sexuality and attraction. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is honest about his feelings, which is important in relationships. But breaking up over something that's a core part of the partner's identity might be seen as invalidating their identity. However, if the author is truly straight and not attracted to men, then he might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship because he can't be attracted to his partner anymore. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is based on respecting the partner's identity or rejecting it. If the author respects the partner's identity but realizes he's not attracted to men, then he's not in the wrong. If he's rejecting the partner's identity and using his sexuality as an excuse for being transphobic, then he would be wrong. But in this case, the author says he's fine with trans people, just not wanting to date a guy. So it's more about sexual orientation than transphobia.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because he's being honest about his feelings and sexual orientation, even though it's difficult. However, others might argue that he should have worked through it regardless. But from a personal autonomy standpoint, he has the right to choose his relationships based on his attractions.\n"
