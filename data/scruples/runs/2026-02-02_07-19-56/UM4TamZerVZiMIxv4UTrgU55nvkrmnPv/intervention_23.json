I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after breaking up with their SO who is trans. The SO was biologically female, and the author is a straight guy. The SO made subtle comments before coming out as trans and changing their appearance. The author felt that their gender matters because he's straight and didn't want to date a guy, trans or not. Now the ex is upset, and the author is wondering if he's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. He says he's fine with trans people but not with the fact that his SO is trans because he's straight. So does that make him wrong? Well, being straight means being attracted to the opposite sex, which in this case is male. The SO is transitioning to become male, so the author's attraction might be based on their previous understanding of the person's gender. But is it wrong to not want to date someone of the same gender if you're straight?\n\nThen, the SO's perspective. They might have been open about their identity for a while, and the author only realized now. The author didn't address the subtle comments earlier, which could have been an opportunity to talk about his feelings. By waiting until after the transition was more visible, he might have caused hurt because it seems like a reaction to their transition rather than their gender identity being a deal-breaker all along. \n\nAlso, the way he broke up\u2014saying he's not in the wrong. The SO is now upset, which is common when a relationship ends, but the author's reasoning is based on his own sexuality. However, some might argue that it's important to accept a partner for who they are, and if the person's gender is a key factor, that could be a conflict of values. \n\nBut the author is a high school student, so maybe he's still figuring out his sexuality and identity. It's possible he's not ready to be in a relationship where his partner is male. On the other hand, if the person remains his true self, just identifying as a different gender, the author's attraction might not be based on the person's identity but their presentation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a standpoint of respecting people's identities, even if it changes the dynamic, it's important to be honest. The author was honest, but the timing and approach might be questionable. Did he give the SO a chance to express their identity earlier? The SO had made subtle comments, which the author might have ignored or misunderstood. \n\nSo maybe the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own feelings and sexuality, but he could have handled the breakup better. However, others might see it as a failure to accept the SO's identity. The answer could depend on cultural or personal values. In some circles, it's considered wrong to end a relationship based on someone's true identity, while others might say it's about personal choice and honesty. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author acted in bad faith. Since he's not bigoted and says he's fine with trans people, but his attraction is tied to gender, that's a valid point. But the fact that he didn't address the earlier hints could make it seem like he waited until it was too late. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his feelings and sexuality, but there's a nuance in communication. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so maybe there's a different angle.\n"
