I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who identifies as a straight guy, broke up with their high school partner after finding out they're trans. The partner is biologically female but now identifies as male. The author didn't have any issues with trans people but realized they weren't comfortable dating someone they now see as male.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of consent and mutual respect in relationships. The author's partner came out as trans, which is a part of their identity. The author is saying that because they're straight, they prefer dating people who are female, and now that their partner is identifying as male, it doesn't align with their sexuality. That seems like a matter of personal preference, not something malicious.\n\nBut wait, the author was dating someone who was assigned female at birth but is now identifying as male. So, if the author's sexual orientation is strictly towards individuals who are female (cis or trans), then this might be a conflict. However, the author's partner had been making subtle comments before coming out fully. Maybe the author didn't pick up on those hints, and when the partner finally revealed their identity, the author realized it's a deal-breaker. \n\nNow, breaking up because of a change in the partner's gender identity after a year of being in a relationship\u2014does that make the author wrong? Well, relationships require both parties to be compatible in terms of identity and needs. If the author is straight and the partner is now identifying as male, the author might feel their needs aren't met. But the key question is whether the author respected their partner's identity and communicated this properly. \n\nThe author tried to break up gently, which is good. However, the partner is upset because they might have felt rejected for who they are. The author might be seen as choosing their sexuality over their partner's identity, which could be hurtful. But from another angle, the author isn't in the wrong for realizing that their sexual orientation doesn't align with their partner's gender identity now. It's a matter of personal compatibility. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author was aware of their partner's identity early on. Since the partner had been making subtle comments, maybe the author missed those signals. If the partner had come out earlier, maybe the author would have considered their own feelings. But since the partner did come out now, the author has to make a choice. \n\nUltimately, it's a tough situation. The author isn't in the wrong for their personal feelings about their sexuality, but they might be in the wrong if they didn't support their partner's identity. But if the partner is now male, and the author is straight, then the author's feelings are valid. However, the way the breakup was handled and the partner's reaction might suggest that the author could have communicated better or considered the impact. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a decision based on their own sexuality. But it's a sensitive situation where both people have valid points.\n"
