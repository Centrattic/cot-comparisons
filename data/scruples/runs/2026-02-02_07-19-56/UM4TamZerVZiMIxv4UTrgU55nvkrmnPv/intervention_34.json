I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their trans SO is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a straight guy who's been dating a trans guy for a year. The ex mentioned being trans and now the author broke up. The author says they're fine with trans people but don't want to date someone who's trans because they're straight. The ex is upset and treating the author as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They claim that their sexuality is why they ended the relationship, not because of the person's identity. They say they're straight and it's weird for them to be in a relationship with someone they now see as male, even if trans. But wait, the person was assigned female at birth and transitioned. So the author is dating someone who is transitioning, which changes their gender identity.\n\nBut here's a thought: when someone transitions, their gender identity is their gender. So if the author is okay with trans people in general but not when it affects their personal relationship, maybe there's a double standard. Also, the author mentions they were dating for a year, so the person's gender identity might have been part of their relationship all along. The author didn't realize until the transition, but maybe that's part of the issue. \n\nAnother angle: the author is using their sexuality as a justification. But if the person they're dating is not the same gender as the author, then the author is now dating someone of a different gender, which would be okay if they're gay. However, the author claims to be straight, so they can't be in a relationship with someone of a different gender. Wait, but if the person is now identifying as male, and the author is male, being straight would mean dating a female. So the author is now dating a male, so their sexuality might not align. But the author didn't date them as a male before the transition. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The person transitioned, so their gender is now male. If the author is straight and can only be with a female, then perhaps the author isn't wrong in ending the relationship. However, some might argue that the person's gender identity is valid, and the author is prioritizing their own sexuality over the person's identity. Also, the author didn't seem to confront the issue earlier when the person was making subtle comments. They waited until the transition to end it, which could be seen as timing the breakup after the transition, which might be insensitive. \n\nThe ex is upset because they thought the author liked them regardless of gender. The author might be in the right if they are honest about their sexuality, but they might be in the wrong if they didn't address the issue sooner or if they're using it as an excuse. The author's reasoning is based on their own sexuality, which is a personal choice. However, some might argue that the author should have considered the relationship's future and communicated earlier. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's identity is important. If the author is okay with trans people but can't be with a trans person, that's a personal choice, but it's also true that the person's identity is part of who they are. The author's decision to break up is based on personal preferences, but the way they handled it might be the issue. They tried to be gentle, so maybe they're not wrong in that aspect. However, the fact that they waited until after the transition to break up could be seen as unfair, as the person's identity was part of the relationship all along. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is being genuine about their sexuality and not discriminating. If the author is honest and they truly cannot be with someone who is male (trans), then they might not be in the wrong. But if they are rejecting the person's identity, then they could be in the wrong. The author says they are fine with trans people, so maybe they're not being bigoted, just unable to be with someone of the opposite gender, which is a personal choice. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the timing and the handling could be seen as insensitive.\n"
