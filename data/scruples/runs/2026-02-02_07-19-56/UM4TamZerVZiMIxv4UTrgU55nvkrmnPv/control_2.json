I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after breaking up with their SO who is trans. The author is a straight guy, and the SO is biologically female but identifies as male now. The author found out about their trans identity and broke up because they're straight and don't want to date a guy, trans or not. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author isn't being transphobic, they say they're okay with trans people but just identify as straight. So their reasoning is based on their sexuality. On the other hand, the SO might feel that the author is invalidating their identity or using it as a reason to end the relationship, which can be hurtful. \n\nThe author tried to be gentle, but the breakup caused the SO to treat them as an asshole. The key points here are about personal choice and mutual respect. The author's choice to end the relationship based on their sexual orientation could be seen as a matter of personal preference rather than prejudice. However, some might argue that the author didn't consider the SO's feelings enough or didn't make an effort to understand their identity. \n\nBut the author did say they're not transphobic and were trying to be respectful by using correct pronouns. They were in a high school relationship, so maybe they're still figuring things out. The SO's identity is valid, but the author's sexuality is also a valid aspect of who they are. So, is the author wrong? It's a tough call. The breakup is a personal decision based on their sexuality, which isn't the same as being transphobic. So the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to date a guy based on their orientation, even if their partner is trans.\n"
