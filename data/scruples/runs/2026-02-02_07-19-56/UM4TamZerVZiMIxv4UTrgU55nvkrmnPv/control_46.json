I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The author identifies as a straight guy and feels that their sexuality makes it so they can't date a trans guy. The ex-partner is upset and thinks the author is an asshole. The user wants to know if the author is wrong here. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is in high school, so maybe they're still figuring out their own sexuality and identity. They mention being fine with trans people but not wanting to date one due to their straight identity. The partner felt hurt and rejected, leading to the breakup. \n\nNow, in terms of right and wrong, this isn't a black-and-white issue. The author's decision is based on their own feelings about their sexuality, which is a personal matter. However, the ex-partner might feel that the author is being discriminatory or not accepting. The key here is whether the author's actions are considered wrong based on societal views on transgender issues.\n\nIn many contexts, respecting someone's gender identity is considered important. The author is changing the pronouns and acknowledging the partner's identity, which shows some level of acceptance. However, the fact that they broke up because they are straight might be seen as valid from the author's perspective but hurtful from the partner's side. \n\nIt's also worth considering if the author communicated the breakup respectfully. They said they tried to be gentle, which might mitigate the harshness of their decision. But the partner still feels treated poorly. \n\nThe debate here is between respecting one's own sexuality versus the potential impact on the partner's feelings. Some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they can't be forced to change their preferences. Others might say that the partner's identity is valid, and the author's decision is a form of rejection based on gender identity, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nHowever, the author isn't denying the partner's identity; they're just not interested in dating them due to their own sexual orientation. That's a personal choice. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. The line between personal choice and discrimination can be thin. If the author is okay with trans people in general but not in a personal relationship, that's a personal preference. But if the partner feels that the author is not accepting their identity, then it's a conflict.\n\nI think the key point is that the author is not being malicious or discriminatory; they're stating their feelings based on their understanding of their own sexuality. Therefore, the answer might be B. However, some might argue that the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship due to the partner's gender, which is a valid identity. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and the author's actions are based on their own beliefs, it's a matter of perspective. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's choice is seen as a personal preference versus a moral failing.\n"
