I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a partner after they came out as trans. The user is a straight guy, and he's in high school. The partner was biologically female but transitioned. The person is questioning if they're the asshole for breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author says they're okay with trans people but don't want to date a guy, trans or not. So their reasoning is based on their sexuality. The partner came out after a year of dating, which the author had some subtle hints about but wasn't sure. Then, when the partner transitioned, the author decided to break up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. The author states they're not transphobic but just not interested in dating a guy. The partner might have felt that the author wasn't truly accepting of them, leading to the breakup. But the author's decision is based on their sexual orientation. Is it wrong to break up because your partner's gender identity doesn't align with what you're attracted to?\n\nI think this is a matter of personal choice. If the author is straight and the partner is now identifying as male, the author's attraction changes. But the partner might feel that the author isn't accepting them for who they are. However, the author isn't rejecting the partner for being trans; they're rejecting the partner because they now identify as a gender the author isn't interested in. So it's a conflict between the author's sexuality and the partner's identity. \n\nBut wait, in some perspectives, if the author was dating a female and the partner is trans male, technically, the author is still dating a male. If the author is straight, then they might not be interested in a male. So the author's decision is based on their own orientation. However, the author might be in a position where they need to accept the partner's identity, but if the attraction isn't there, it's a valid reason to break up. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had known the partner was trans before starting the relationship, they might not have started it. The partner came out after a year, so the author might feel misled, but the partner might have been in the process of transitioning. The author might have been dating them as a female for a long time, and now the partner's transition is a new development. \n\nBut the core issue is whether it's wrong to break up based on the partner's gender identity after a long relationship. If the author is not transphobic and is just not interested in a guy, then it's a personal choice. However, some might argue that the author should have accepted the partner regardless of their gender identity, but that's a matter of perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're acting based on their sexuality. But it's a sensitive situation where the partner may feel rejected. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. It's a tough call, but the key is that the author isn't being transphobic, just clarifying their own preferences.\n"
