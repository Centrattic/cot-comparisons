I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong after breaking up with their partner because they're transgender. The author states they're a straight guy and that they don't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up after their partner came out as trans.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author mentions they're okay with trans people in general but not with dating a trans man because their sexuality is straight. The key question is whether it's wrong to end a relationship based on the partner's gender identity.\n\nI know that being transgender is about a person's gender identity, not their biological sex. The author's partner was assigned female at birth but identifies as male. The author is straight, meaning they're attracted to women. So if the partner is now identifying as a man, the author feels it's no longer a same-sex relationship, which contradicts their orientation.\n\nBut wait, in many societies, relationships are about mutual identity. If someone transitions, their legal and social identity is as the gender they identify with. So the author's decision might be based on the partner's current gender identity. However, some might argue that the author is invalidating the partner's identity by choosing to end the relationship.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respect and support. The partner might have been vulnerable sharing their identity, and the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author is being honest about their sexuality, how they communicated the breakup matters. The partner feels treated poorly, which is a red flag.\n\nBut the author also says they tried to be gentle. However, the partner's reaction suggests they feel hurt or rejected. The author's stance is about personal preference and sexuality, which are valid aspects of oneself. However, some might argue that a commitment to a relationship should include support through such life changes, unless there's a fundamental incompatibility.\n\nI should also consider if the author's reasoning is discriminatory. If being trans is the reason for the breakup, even though the author claims to be fine with trans people, it could be seen as a contradiction. But if the author is truly straight and identifies as male, their attraction is based on the partner's gender as they perceive it. However, when the partner transitions, the author's perception of their gender changes, making it a same-sex relationship from the author's perspective.\n\nAnother angle is societal progress. In many places, being trans is recognized, and relationships should be based on mutual acceptance of each other's identities. The author might be acting on personal beliefs that don't align with the partner's transition. But is that the author's fault? They are being honest about their feelings, even if it leads to the breakup.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily being malicious but is making a decision based on their own sexuality. However, the impact on the partner is significant. The answer could depend on whether the author's choice is seen as respecting their own boundaries versus being dismissive of the partner's identity. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting on their authentic feelings, but the way they handled it might have been improved. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong. But maybe the community might have different views.\n"
