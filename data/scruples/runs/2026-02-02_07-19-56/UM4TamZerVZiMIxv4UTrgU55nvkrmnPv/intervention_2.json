For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person is in high school, dating someone who's biologically female. They've been together almost a year. The SO made subtle comments about feeling more like a guy, but the author thought maybe they were misinterpreting. Then the SO got a haircut and used a binder, and came out as trans, asking to be referred to as a guy. The author is straight and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up, and now the ex is upset. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. They're stating their sexuality as straight, so they don't consider themselves attracted to men. If their SO transitioned, that would change their gender identity. The author's reasoning is that since they're straight, dating a guy (even trans) doesn't align with their sexuality. That seems like a valid reason for them, based on their own sexual orientation.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO might feel hurt or rejected, especially if they didn't come out until later. The author might have been in a relationship with someone they didn't realize was trans, which could complicate things. But the author mentions that there were subtle hints before, so maybe they had some indication but weren't sure.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Relationships can end for various reasons, including differences in compatibility. If the author is honest about their feelings and sexuality, breaking up might be necessary for them. But was the timing appropriate? The SO might have been vulnerable after coming out, and the breakup could feel abrupt. However, the author tried to be gentle.\n\nAlso, the author's use of \"they\" due to uncertainty about pronouns might be a positive, showing respect. But the main issue is whether the author is wrong for breaking up based on their sexuality. If the author is being honest and the SO's transition is recent, the author isn't necessarily being discriminatory. However, some might argue that the relationship could have continued if the author was okay with the change. But if the author's orientation is genuine, they can't be expected to change that.\n\nAnother angle: the SO might feel that the author didn't support them through their transition, which could be hurtful. But the author's stance is based on their own sexuality, not a rejection of the person. It's a matter of personal choice and boundaries.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respecting someone's gender identity is important. The author isn't rejecting their identity but stating that their attraction is based on the opposite sex. If the author is accepting of trans people in general but not in their personal relationship, that's their choice. However, some might see it as invalidating if the author wasn't aware of the SO's gender identity from the start. But in this case, the SO came out later, so the author couldn't have known earlier.\n\nSo, the author isn't being malicious; they're acting on their own sexual orientation. The SO might need to adjust or find someone who is attracted to them in their affirmed gender. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings in the relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
