For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThey're in high school and have been dating their partner for almost a year. Their partner is biologically female but has revealed they're trans, now identifying as a guy. The author is straight and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up because of their sexuality. The partner is upset and treating them like an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. They mention they're okay with trans people but their sexuality is straight, so they don't date guys. Their partner was transitioning, which might have changed their gender identity. The author is a teenager, so maybe they're still figuring out their own feelings and how they align with their partner's identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner's transition is a significant part of their identity. If the partner was already transitioning before the relationship, maybe the author should have known before getting into the relationship. But the partner was making subtle comments before, and the author thought they were misinterpreting. The partner might have not been fully out before, so the author couldn't have known.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship based on their sexuality. Being straight means they are attracted to the opposite gender. If the partner is now transitioning to a male, then from the author's perspective, they're dating someone of the same biological sex, but the partner's gender identity is male. The author feels it's not compatible with being straight. But societal views on trans individuals and how they fit into traditional categories of sexuality can be complex.\n\nSome might argue that the author is not in the wrong because they are being honest about their feelings and sexuality. However, others might say that the author didn't consider the partner's identity and transition process, leading to the breakup. The author could have tried to adjust or support the partner, but if their sexual orientation is strictly straight, they might not be able to be in a relationship with someone who is trans, even if they are comfortable with trans people in general.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author acted respectfully. They tried to be gentle, but the breakup is based on a core aspect of their identity. The partner might feel abandoned, especially after the transition. The partner might have felt that the author didn't accept them as they are, which can be hurtful. However, the author's stance is about their own sexual orientation, not about rejecting the partner as a person.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a moral dilemma. The author is honest about their feelings, which is important in relationships. But the partner might feel that the author didn't support their transition. It's possible that the author could have stayed in the relationship and adjusted, but if their sexuality is a fixed part of who they are, that might not be feasible.\n\nI think the answer depends on how one views the intersection of sexual orientation and gender identity. If someone is straight and their partner transitions from female to male, they might no longer see the partner as the opposite gender, making the relationship incompatible in terms of sexual orientation. However, some might argue that the person's identity remains female, but that's not the case here since the partner identifies as male now.\n\nGiven the information, the author's decision is based on their own sexuality, which they can't control. They tried to handle it gently, so they might not be in the wrong. But the hurt caused to the partner is understandable. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid perspectives. However, based on the author's reasoning and their honesty, I might lean towards them not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
