I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for breaking up with their SO after finding out they're trans. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a straight guy who was in a relationship with someone who is biologically female but is now identifying as trans male. The key here is their sexuality. The author states that they're fine with trans people but not with dating someone who is transgender because they identify as straight. \n\nThe main issue is whether it's wrong to end a relationship based on the partner's gender identity. Gender identity is a personal aspect, and if the author's sexual orientation is strictly heterosexual, then they might feel that dating someone who now identifies as male makes them uncomfortable. However, it's important to note that the person was biologically female and is transitioning. Some people might argue that the author's decision is based on the person's gender identity rather than their true self, which could be a point of contention.\n\nBut from a standpoint of personal choice and sexuality, if someone is straight and their partner transitions genders, it's a legitimate reason for them to feel the relationship isn't right anymore. The author tried to be gentle and explain their reasoning, which is a respectful approach. The ex's reaction might be about feeling rejected, but the author's decision is based on their own sexual preferences, which aren't inherently wrong, even if the choice is unpopular.\n\nI should also consider the dynamics of consent and mutual attraction. If the author didn't feel comfortable continuing the relationship after the transition, it's their right to choose. However, some might argue that the author should have considered the partner's feelings more before ending the relationship, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it sensitively.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they are acting in accordance with their sexual orientation, even if it causes hurt feelings. Their choice to end the relationship is a personal one and not inherently wrong.\n"
