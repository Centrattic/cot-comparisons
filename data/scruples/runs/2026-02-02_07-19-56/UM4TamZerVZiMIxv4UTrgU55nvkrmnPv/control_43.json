I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The author says they're a straight guy and it's weird for them to date a guy, trans or not. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, being trans is protected under anti-discrimination laws, so treating someone differently just because they're trans could be considered discriminatory. But in a personal relationship, especially between two people in a school setting, it's a bit different. The author is stating their preferences, which might not be illegal, but could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and communication. The partner had mentioned feeling more like a guy before, so maybe the author didn't address those earlier comments. Now, after the transition, the author is ending the relationship. The partner feels hurt and is treating the author poorly. The author's reasoning is that their sexuality means gender matters. But some might argue that love and relationships are about the person, not just their gender. However, others might say that if someone is straight and only interested in women, they can't help how they feel.\n\nI should also think about the partner's perspective. The trans person might feel rejected because their identity is being disregarded. It's important to validate someone's gender identity. The author might not be malicious, but their action could be seen as invalidating. However, the author is being honest about their feelings, which is also a valid point.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, some might argue that the author is not in the wrong because they're being truthful about their sexuality. But others might say that in a relationship, staying together despite one partner's transition is possible if both are committed. However, the author isn't saying they hate trans people, just that their sexuality makes it incompatible. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions are considered discriminatory. If the author is respecting the partner's identity but just can't reconcile it with their own sexuality, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're treating the partner as if their transition is a problem, that's where the issue lies. The key is that the author is not being hostile, just honest about their preferences. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A because of the impact on the partner. However, I think in this case, since the author isn't being discriminatory but is acting on their own sexuality, the answer is B.\n"
