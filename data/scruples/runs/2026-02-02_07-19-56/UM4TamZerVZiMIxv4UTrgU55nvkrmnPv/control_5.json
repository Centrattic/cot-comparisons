I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after the partner came out as trans. The author is a straight guy who was dating someone who is biologically female but transitioned to male. The key points here are about the author's sexuality and the partner's gender identity.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're straight, so they identify as a man attracted to women. After the partner transitioned, the author feels it's a problem because their orientation is towards women, not men. But the partner was assigned female at birth and identifies as male. So, from a biological standpoint, the author was dating a woman transitioning, but from a gender identity perspective, the partner is now identifying as male.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that their sexuality makes the gender matter. But here's the thing: being trans is about gender identity, not biological sex. If someone identifies as a man, regardless of their birth sex, they are a man in terms of gender. So if the author is straight and was initially dating a woman, then the partner transitioning to male would mean the author is now in a relationship with a man. Since the author is straight, they're not comfortable with that.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author didn't address this issue sooner. The partner was making subtle comments for a while, and the author could have had this conversation before the transition. But the author didn't, perhaps not realizing the significance. The breakup happened after the transition, but the author's stance is that their sexuality makes it incompatible.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner might feel that their identity is valid and that the author is ending the relationship because of their gender identity, which is a personal choice. But the author is honest about their feelings and sexuality. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own sexuality over the partner's identity.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone is straight and their partner transitions, their feelings might change, but in this case, the author is choosing to end the relationship because their attraction is based on the partner's previous gender. However, this could be seen as invalidating the partner's identity. But if the author is straight, they might not be able to change their sexual orientation. \n\nLegally and socially, being trans is a protected identity, and discrimination based on gender identity is not acceptable. However, in terms of personal relationships, people have the right to choose their partners based on their own preferences and comfort, even if it's not politically correct. The author isn't being cruel but is being honest about their feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship due to personal incompatibility, especially if they're being honest and respectful. The partner's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that no longer aligns with their sexuality. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
