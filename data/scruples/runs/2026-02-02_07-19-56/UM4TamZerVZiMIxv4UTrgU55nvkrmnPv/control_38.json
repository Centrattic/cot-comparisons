I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're a straight guy and realized their partner is trans, which makes them uncomfortable because they prefer dating cisgender women. They had been in a relationship for almost a year, and the partner came out as trans. The author decided to break up, leading to conflict.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author states they're not opposed to trans people in general, but their sexuality makes it so they don't want to date a guy, trans or not. The key point here is whether the breakup is justified based on the author's orientation. \n\nStraight people typically define themselves as being attracted to the opposite sex. If the partner was assigned female at birth but identifies as male, the author might feel it's a change in the partner's gender, which affects their orientation. However, some might argue that the person's gender identity is their true identity, so the author's discomfort could be seen as invalidating that.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their feelings and sexuality. They didn't want to continue the relationship if it no longer aligned with their orientation. The partner is upset, but the author isn't showing malice or hatred, just personal feelings.\n\nThe ethical question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and orientation. Since being in a relationship requires mutual attraction, the author's decision might be seen as a personal choice rather than something malicious. However, some might say that the author should have been more understanding or that the partner's identity should be the determining factor.\n\nI should check if there's any indication of the author being disrespectful or cruel. The author tried to be gentle, so it's not about discrimination but personal preference. The partner's reaction of treating them as an asshole is their own choice, but the author isn't malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting on their genuine feelings and self-awareness. It's a personal choice, not a moral failing. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
