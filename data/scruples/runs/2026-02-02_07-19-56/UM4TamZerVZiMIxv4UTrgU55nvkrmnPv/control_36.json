I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with their significant other after finding out they're trans. The author is a straight guy, and he broke up with his SO because he doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The SO has been making comments about feeling more like a guy for a while, and the author noticed changes like a hair cut and a binder. Then the SO came out as trans and asked to be referred to as a guy. The author, identifying as straight, felt that his sexuality made the relationship incompatible, so he broke up. The SO is upset and the author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, what does the law or ethics say about this? Well, in many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender identity. However, this is a personal relationship, not a public or employment context. So the question is more about whether it's morally or socially wrong, not legally. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't violating any laws by ending the relationship. But from a social or moral perspective, some might argue that the author is prioritizing his sexual orientation over the person's identity, which could be seen as invalidating. Others might say that people have the right to date within their sexual orientation, and the author isn't in the wrong for that.\n\nAlso, the author claims to be okay with trans people but not to date one. This is a common point of debate. Some argue that if someone is attracted to the person regardless of gender, they can still be in a relationship. Others say that sexual orientation is about who you're attracted to, and if the person's gender identity changes, it's natural for the attraction to shift. \n\nThe SO's reaction is also a factor. If the author communicated the breakup respectfully and honestly, it's not necessarily his fault. The SO might be feeling hurt or rejected, which is understandable. But does that make the author wrong? It's a matter of perspective.\n\nIn summary, while the author's actions may not be legally wrong, the moral or social judgment varies. Some would say the author is wrong for not adjusting his sexual orientation to the SO's identity, while others would support his right to date within his orientation. The answer likely depends on the values of the person judging. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is probably B (No), as personal choices in relationships often aren't considered wrong unless they involve harm or discrimination in a protected context.\n"
