I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The situation is a high school relationship, and the author identifies as straight. The partner is biologically female and identifies as male now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the breakup. The author mentions they're not opposed to trans people but don't want to date someone who's trans because they're straight. The key here is that the person's gender identity has changed, and the author feels their sexuality makes the relationship incompatible. \n\nBut wait, is the author being discriminatory? If the author is straight and only dates people of the opposite biological sex, then once the partner transitions, the author might feel their preferences don't align anymore. However, some might argue that this is a form of transphobia, as the issue is with the partner's gender identity rather than any other trait. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to be respectful and didn't make derogatory remarks. They acknowledge their partner's identity and are just stating their own sexual orientation. The problem here is the conflict between the author's self-identified straightness and the partner's new gender identity. \n\nBut is it really the author's fault for not wanting to date someone of a different gender? If the author is indeed straight, then it's a matter of personal preference. However, some might say that a true commitment to a relationship should overcome such preferences, but that's not always realistic. \n\nAlso, the partner's reaction of treating the author like an asshole could be due to feeling rejected or invalidated. The author might have handled the breakup poorly, but the underlying issue is the change in the partner's identity versus the author's orientation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex issue. The author isn't attacking their partner's identity, just stating that their own sexuality makes the relationship incompatible. However, some might see this as invalidating the partner's identity because the author is choosing to end the relationship based on the partner's gender. \n\nI think the answer depends on how one views the role of gender in sexual orientation. If being straight means only being attracted to the opposite biological sex, then after the partner transitions, the author's orientation no longer aligns. But if the author's issue is with the partner being trans, then that's transphobia. \n\nThe author's explanation seems to be that they're straight and not transphobic, but their action might still be seen as discriminatory because they're rejecting the partner for their gender identity. However, without more context, it's hard to say. The key point is that the author is not being hostile but is acting on their own preferences. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent isn't to be transphobic, their action could be seen as invalidating their partner's identity. However, it's also their right to pursue relationships that align with their sexual orientation as they understand it. The answer might be a nuanced \"no,\" but some might argue \"yes.\" I need to decide which is more appropriate.\n"
