I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down. The author is a straight guy in high school who broke up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The partner was biologically female but identifies as male now, using a breast binder and a new name. The author says they tried to be gentle but ended things, and now the ex is treating them like an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's sexuality and the partner's gender identity. The author states they are straight, which typically means attracted to the opposite sex. However, the partner is trans, which means their gender identity is male, but they were assigned female at birth. So, the author is dating someone who was biologically female but now identifies as male. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up because of the partner's gender transition. Legally and ethically, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited in many places, and relationships should be based on mutual respect and acceptance. However, the author is not claiming the partner is lying about their identity or anything like that. They're saying that because they're straight, they feel it matters that the partner is now male. \n\nIn this case, the author's decision is based on their own sexual orientation. If being with a trans man is outside their comfort zone due to being straight, maybe they feel they can't be in a relationship with a man. But some might argue that if the partner is indeed male, then the author is dating a man, and their sexuality should be about the person's gender identity, not their biological sex. \n\nHowever, the author isn't rejecting the partner for being trans per se; the breakup is about the partner's new identity conflicting with the author's self-identification as straight. It's important to note that the partner had been making subtle comments about their identity, and the author had their own misinterpretations. The partner then made a transition decision, which the author had to process. \n\nThe ex is upset and treating the author like an asshole, but the author isn't denying the partner's identity. The author is just not into dating someone they now see as a guy. The problem here might be that the author didn't accept the partner's identity, but it's complicated because the author is straight and may not feel attracted to a guy. \n\nIn some contexts, people argue that if you're in a relationship with someone who was assigned a different gender but identifies as their true self, your sexuality should be about their current identity. But others might say that if the partner's transition changes the dynamic (from a woman to a man), then the author's feelings are valid, even if they're not comfortable with it. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel to the partner's identity; they're just ending the relationship. But the way they handled it could be an issue. The partner might feel that the author was hiding their true feelings instead of accepting them. However, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their sexuality. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't being wrong for breaking up based on their own sexual orientation, even if it's controversial. They did try to be gentle, but their feelings are genuine. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
