I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner upon finding out they're trans. The situation is that the partner was biologically female, but now identifies as a guy. The author is a straight guy and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up, and the ex is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author isn't opposed to trans people; they just don't want to date someone who is male, regardless of being trans. Since the partner transitioned, the author's sexuality makes this a problem. The question is whether it's wrong to end the relationship because of the partner's gender identity.\n\nI should think about consent and mutual understanding. The partner had made subtle comments before, so maybe they felt they had some indication. But the author didn't act on those comments until the transition became more apparent. The partner might feel that the author didn't communicate their feelings earlier, which could be seen as a lack of honesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their sexuality. If they identify as straight and are only attracted to women, and their partner is now identifying as a man, it's reasonable for the author to feel that they can't continue the relationship. It's about personal boundaries and sexuality. However, some might argue that the author should have been more communicative before the partner transitioned, to avoid confusion.\n\nAnother angle is the timing. The author waited until after the partner started transitioning to break up. Maybe the partner expected the author to have discussed their feelings earlier when the comments were made. The author's decision could be seen as a lack of support during a vulnerable time for the partner.\n\nBut considering the author's perspective, they are acting according to their own identity. They aren't being transphobic, just stating their sexual orientation. The issue here is whether it's acceptable to end a relationship because one's sexual orientation no longer aligns with the partner's gender identity, especially if the partner has transitioned after the relationship started.\n\nIn some cases, people might expect their partners to be open about their identity before making a commitment. However, since the partner was in high school and transitioning recently, it's a complicated situation. The author might not have had prior knowledge, and the partner might have felt it was their decision to come out when they were ready.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They are honest about their sexuality, but the timing and communication might be an issue. They didn't act on the earlier hints, which could have led to a more amicable resolution. However, their decision to break up based on their own sexual orientation might be justified. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether honesty about one's sexual orientation is sufficient, even if it comes after the partner's transition. If the author is true to themselves, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, the way they handled the breakup and the lack of communication before the transition could be seen as a problem. But ultimately, the author's sexuality is a personal matter, and they can't be wrong for acting on that.\n"
