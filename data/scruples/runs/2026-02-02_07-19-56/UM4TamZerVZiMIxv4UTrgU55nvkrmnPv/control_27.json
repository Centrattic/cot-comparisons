I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their partner because they're trans is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a straight guy who's been dating someone biologically female for a year. The partner came out as trans and wanted to be referred to as a guy. The author, identifying as straight, decided to break up because he doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. The partner is upset and thinks the author is an asshole. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in high school, which might mean they're younger and still figuring things out. The partner transitioned after a year of dating. The author claims they're not opposed to trans people but their sexuality is a factor. \n\nNow, the core issue here is about the author's sexuality and how they define their orientation. If he identifies as straight, meaning he's only attracted to women, then once his partner transitioned, he no longer considers them a woman. But some might argue that sexual orientation can be about attraction to someone regardless of gender identity. However, the author is clear that he's straight and that he's not interested in dating someone he now perceives as male. \n\nThe partner feels wronged because the author didn't support them after their transition. Transitioning is a significant part of a person's identity, and the author's decision to break up based solely on gender could be seen as invalidating the partner's identity. But the author isn't opposing trans people; he's just stating his own sexuality limits the relationship. \n\nLegally and in terms of basic human rights, there's no law against breaking up with someone for this reason. However, from a social and ethical standpoint, some might argue that the author is being insensitive. The partner might feel that the author didn't give them the chance to adjust or that he didn't respect his identity. On the other hand, the author is honest about his feelings and sexuality. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's complicated. The author isn't being cruel for no reason; he's acting based on his understanding of his sexuality. But the partner's transition is a fundamental aspect of their identity. The key here is whether the author's actions were respectful and compassionate. The author tried to be gentle, but the partner still feels hurt. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is considered a rejection of the partner's identity. If the author is accepting of trans people but not of dating someone who is now male, it's a personal choice. However, the partner might see this as a rejection of their gender identity. But since the author is being honest about his feelings and isn't discriminating against trans people in general, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that by identifying as straight, he's limiting his relationships based on someone's gender identity, which could be seen as a form of discrimination. However, sexual orientation is generally considered a personal aspect. If someone is straight and only attracted to women, it's part of their identity. So, the author isn't wrong for acting on his sexual orientation. \n\nThe partner's reaction is understandable because they might feel that their transition wasn't accepted. But the author is also honest about his feelings. In this case, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
