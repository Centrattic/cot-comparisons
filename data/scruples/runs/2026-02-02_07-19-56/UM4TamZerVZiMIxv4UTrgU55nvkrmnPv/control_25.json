For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a guy in high school, dating someone they refer to as \"they\" because they're not sure about pronouns. The person they were dating is biologically female but identifies as trans and now wants to be referred to as a guy. The author found out after a year of dating and decided to break up because they consider themselves straight and don't want to date a guy, trans or not. Now the ex is upset, and the author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author says they're okay with trans people but not into dating them because of their sexuality. The ex argues that the author's feelings for them shouldn't be affected by their gender. The author tried to be gentle but ended up breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about this. The author's decision is based on their sexual orientation. If they identify as straight, then they're attracted to people of the opposite sex. If their partner transitioned and is now identifying as male, the author might feel that their attraction is no longer aligned with their sexuality. However, some might argue that since the person is their partner, the author's feelings should be about the person as a whole, not just their gender. But others might see it as a matter of personal preference and that the author isn't in the wrong for realizing they don't want to pursue a relationship with someone they now see as the same gender.\n\nAlso, the author tried to be respectful, asking about pronouns and giving context about being in high school. The ex's reaction might be due to feeling rejected or misunderstood. But the author's reasoning is based on their own feelings of attraction, which are personal. \n\nI should also consider the societal perspective. Some people might view the author as not accepting, but if they are being honest about their feelings and not being discriminatory beyond their personal preferences, it's a matter of personal choice. However, if the author is being discriminatory against trans people, that's different. The author claims they are fine with trans people but just not interested in dating them. That's a bit of a line to walk. \n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships should be based on mutual respect and compatibility. If one person's core values (in this case, sexuality) are incompatible with the relationship, ending it might be necessary. The author isn't rejecting the person for who they are but for a specific aspect of their identity that affects the relationship's nature. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. \n\nBut another angle: if the author was okay with the person before they came out as trans, does transitioning change the person in a way that invalidates the relationship? The author might feel it does because of their sexual orientation. It's a personal choice, so unless there's malice or discrimination, it's not necessarily the author's fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting according to their own feelings and sexual orientation, even if it's a difficult situation. However, some might argue that the author should have been more accepting. But given the information, the author is honest and tried to handle it gently, so they might not be at fault.\n"
