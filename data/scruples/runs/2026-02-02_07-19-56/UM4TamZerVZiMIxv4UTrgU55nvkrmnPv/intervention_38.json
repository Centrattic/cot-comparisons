I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a straight guy who broke up with their high school SO after the SO revealed they're trans. The SO was biologically female but now identifies as male. The author mentions that the SO had made subtle comments before, like feeling more like a guy, and then started wearing a binder and cutting their hair. The author says they're okay with trans people but don't want to date a guy because they're straight. The SO is upset and treating the author as an asshole. The author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about sexuality, identity, and whether the author's decision to break up was justified. The author is stating that their sexuality is a factor, so they're not dating a guy. But the SO was assigned female at birth, which complicates things. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when someone's gender identity changes, it's a significant part of their identity. The author's SO came out as trans, which might have changed the author's perception of their relationship. The author is in high school, so maybe they're still figuring out their own feelings and how they relate to their partner's identity.\n\nThe author claims they tried to be kind, but the SO feels hurt. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author is being honest about their sexuality and how it affects their ability to be in a relationship. They didn't end the relationship out of malice but because of their own feelings. On the other hand, the SO might have expected the relationship to continue since they didn't see their identity as a barrier.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions they're \"not in the wrong\" because they're straight. But if the SO transitioned, does that change the author's sexual orientation? If the author is only interested in people assigned female at birth, regardless of their gender identity, then maybe the author isn't being homophobic or transphobic. However, some might argue that the author is prioritizing their own comfort over their partner's identity and that the relationship could have been navigated differently.\n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't know the SO was trans beforehand. The SO had been making subtle comments, but the author didn't pick up on them. When the SO came out, the author had to make a decision. The SO might feel that the author didn't support them enough. But the author is also being honest about their feelings, which is a valid reason to end a relationship if it's causing conflict.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say the author is being inconsiderate by not trying to adjust their understanding of their sexuality. Others might say the author is being truthful and that their sexuality is a legitimate factor. The line between being honest and being hurtful can be blurry here.\n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. The author's actions might not make them the asshole, but they might have handled it poorly. The key is that the author is being honest, but they might not have considered the emotional impact on their partner. The SO's reaction is also valid because being rejected after coming out can be painful. However, the author isn't obligated to date someone of a gender they don't identify with. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but they could have approached the breakup with more empathy.\n"
