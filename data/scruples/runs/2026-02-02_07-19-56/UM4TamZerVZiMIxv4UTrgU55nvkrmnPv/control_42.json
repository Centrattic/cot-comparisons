I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after the partner came out as trans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is that the author (a guy) was dating someone for almost a year, and then the partner revealed they are trans and want to be referred to as a guy. The author is straight, so he doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. As a result, he broke up with them. The ex is upset and is treating the author as an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the key factors here. The author says they are okay with trans people but their sexuality is such that they don't want to date a guy. The partner feels that the author is ending the relationship because of their gender, but the author is honest about his feelings. \n\nOne angle is that the author is being honest about his sexuality. If someone is straight, dating a man (even a trans man) isn't something they'd be comfortable with. So, he's being truthful about his feelings, which is important in a relationship. However, the partner might feel rejected or like their identity isn't accepted. But the author wasn't rejecting their identity per se, but rather his own orientation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. But the post says he tried to let them down gently. The issue is whether his decision is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both people to be compatible. If someone's sexual orientation is such that they can only be attracted to cisgender individuals, and their partner is trans, then a breakup might be unavoidable. The author isn't discriminating against trans people; he's just not attracted to men. So, it's about personal preference and honesty. \n\nBut there's also the argument that trans men are men, so if the author is straight, he shouldn't be dating anyone who is a man, regardless of being trans. If he was dating a cis woman and later found out she was trans, but she was assigned male at birth, would he still consider her a woman? Well, in this case, the partner was assigned female at birth and is now transitioning. So, the author is okay with trans people but not with trans men because of his own orientation. \n\nThis is a sensitive area. Some people might say that a trans man is a man, so if you're straight, you shouldn't date them. Others might argue that the person's gender identity is valid, and the author's decision is based on personal preference. Legally, there's no wrong in this scenario; it's about personal choices and compatibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being honest about his feelings. However, the partner might need to process the rejection and understand that it's not about their identity but the author's orientation. The key here is that the author is not being discriminatory but is making a personal choice based on his sexuality. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
