I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong after breaking up with their partner who is transgender. The situation is from a high school context, which might add some factors like age and inexperience.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author is a straight guy who's been dating someone they refer to as \"they\" because they're unsure of the pronouns. The partner is biologically female and recently came out as trans, using male pronouns. The author felt that since they're straight, they can't date a guy, trans or not. They broke up, and now the ex is upset. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal choice in relationships and the validity of the author's reasoning. The author's stance is that their sexuality is part of the issue\u2014they identify as straight and feel that their attraction is to women, not men, even trans men. The ex is upset because they feel their gender identity shouldn't matter to the author's feelings.\n\nI need to consider if the author's decision is based on prejudice or a genuine reflection of their sexuality. The author says they're not against trans people, so it's not about hate. But the question is whether it's wrong to end a relationship because the partner's gender identity doesn't align with the author's sexual orientation. \n\nFrom one perspective, people have the right to know their partner's gender identity and make decisions based on their own feelings. So if the author is indeed straight and can't reconcile their feelings towards a male partner, it's not necessarily wrong to end the relationship. However, the way the breakup was handled might be an issue. The author tried to be gentle, but the ex is upset, which is normal in such situations.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is invalidating the partner's identity by prioritizing their own sexual orientation. The trans person might feel that their identity is being rejected, even if the author isn't being openly prejudiced. There's also the consideration of how the author approached the breakup and whether they were respectful and empathetic.\n\nHigh school relationships can be complicated, and people's identities and feelings are still developing. The author might be acting based on a limited understanding of their own sexuality or trans issues. But the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship based on their feelings towards their partner's gender identity.\n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. If the author is honest about their feelings without malice, it's not necessarily wrong. However, the situation might leave the author open to criticism for not being supportive. But since the author isn't expressing hatred and is respecting the partner's identity (by acknowledging they're trans), the decision might be seen as a personal choice rather than a wrong one.\n"
