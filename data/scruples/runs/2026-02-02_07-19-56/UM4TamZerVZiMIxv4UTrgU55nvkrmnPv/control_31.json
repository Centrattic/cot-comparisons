I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their ex because the ex is trans. Let me unpack this.\n\nThe author is a straight guy in high school, dating someone who was assigned female at birth but is trans. The person came out as trans, wants to be referred to as male now. The author says they're okay with trans people but don't want to date someone who is trans because they're straight. So they broke up. The ex is upset and treating the author badly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender identity, but dating preferences might be a gray area. Legally, maybe the author isn't violating any laws, but ethically?\n\nThe author's stated reason is their sexuality. They say they're straight, so being attracted to someone who is trans might not align with their understanding of being straight. But some people argue that attraction to trans people can still be within the spectrum of straightness, depending on how one defines it. However, the author's own perception is that their sexuality makes this not work.\n\nThen there's the issue of communication. The author tried to be gentle, but the breakup might feel like a rejection based on gender identity. The ex's reaction suggests feeling hurt or invalidated. The question is whether the author's action is discriminatory or if it's a personal choice based on their sexuality.\n\nAnother angle: the author was in a relationship with someone they thought was female for a year, then found out their true gender identity. The author's discomfort isn't about the person's identity but about their own sexual orientation. The ex might feel that the author should be open to adjusting their understanding of sexuality. But others might see it as the author acting according to their genuine feelings.\n\nThere's also the context of being in high school, where relationships can be complex and emotions run high. The author might not have considered the depth of the impact their decision had on the ex. However, the author isn't denying the ex's identity but is stating that their own preferences make the relationship incompatible.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't being openly bigoted, but their decision is based on a personal boundary related to their sexuality. If the author had rejected the ex for not being trans, that would be different, but here it's about the author's attraction. So ethically, it's a personal choice. However, some might argue that the author should be more inclusive of their partner's identity. But without malice, it's hard to say if they're in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Since the user is asking for a binary answer, I need to decide between A or B. Considering the author's intent and the lack of discriminatory intent, maybe they're not in the wrong, but there's room for empathy. However, breaking up due to someone's gender identity can be seen as discriminatory. So perhaps the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because it's a rejection based on the person's identity, even if it's framed as personal preference. Alternatively, if the author's sexuality is genuine, then it's a matter of personal choice. I think the key point is that the author is prioritizing their own comfort over the relationship, which might be seen as justified, but in some contexts, it's considered invalidating. Given the options, the answer could be A or B. But in many modern contexts, being trans is recognized as a core part of identity, and the author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as discriminatory, hence A. However, if the author is being honest about their sexuality, it's a personal choice. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because the author is making a decision based on the person's gender identity, which is a protected characteristic in many places, and that could be seen as wrong regardless of the author's reasons.\n"
