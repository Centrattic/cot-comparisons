I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their partner because they're trans is in the wrong. The situation is from Reddit, the \"Am I the Asshole?\" context.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a straight guy in high school, dating someone who is biologically female but is trans and now identifies as a guy. The author found out and broke up because they don't want to date a guy. The partner is upset, and the author is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know the assistant's take. The task is to answer A or B based on analysis.\n\nSo, considering the ethics here. The author's argument is that their sexuality makes it so they can't date a guy, trans or not. But does that make them the asshole? Well, being honest about one's feelings and sexuality is usually seen as valid. If the author is straight, they might not be comfortable with the change. However, some might argue that the partner's transition is a part of their identity and that the author is choosing their sexual orientation over the partner's identity.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's about honesty and mutual compatibility. The author tried to be gentle, so maybe they're not being mean. But others might say that the author is not accepting the partner as they are. However, the author isn't rejecting them as a person, just their gender identity in the context of their sexual orientation. \n\nIn many cases, people are allowed to date who they are attracted to, and if someone's identity changes in a way that affects that, it's not necessarily wrong to break up. The key is whether the author is being respectful and honest. Since they did communicate and tried to be gentle, maybe they're justified. But the partner might feel rejected, which is understandable. However, the author isn't discriminating against them as a person, just their gender identity in the context of their relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're acting according to their own sexuality and being honest about it, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship.\n"
