But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey're in high school, dating someone they refer to as \"they\" because they're not sure about pronouns. The ex-SO is biologically female but identifies as trans and now wants to be referred to as a guy. The author is a straight guy and realized he doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. So he broke up with them, and now the ex is upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key elements here. The author is straight and has a clear understanding of their sexuality. They've been in a relationship for almost a year, during which the other person made some subtle comments about feeling more like a guy. The author didn't fully understand or misinterpreted these comments. Then, when the ex came out as trans, the author realized their own feelings and that their sexual orientation means they can't date a guy. The breakup was handled gently, they say, but the ex is upset.\n\nI know that being transgender is about a person's gender identity, which may not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. The author is okay with trans people in general but doesn't want to date a guy. That seems to be about their personal sexuality. If the author is straight, then being attracted to people who are biologically female but identify as male might not align with their sexual orientation. However, I should also consider if the author had the opportunity to understand the other person's identity before the relationship started. Did they date someone they considered female, and now that person's transition changes the dynamic?\n\nBut wait, the author's issue is about their own sexuality. If the person they were dating transitioned during the relationship, the author's feelings about their gender identity could be a valid reason for breaking up. However, there's a possibility that the author didn't take enough time to understand or support the other person's identity. The ex might feel that the author was okay with them before the transition and is now leaving because of their new identity, which could be hurtful. That could be seen as invalidating the person's identity.\n\nAnother angle: the author says they're \"not sure about pronouns\" and refer to the ex as \"they.\" Maybe they didn't respect the pronouns the ex wanted to use, which could be another point of contention. If the ex asked to be referred to as a guy, using \"they\" instead of he could be seen as dismissive. However, the author might not have known the correct pronouns yet.\n\nAlso, the author tried to explain that their sexuality is the reason for the breakup. It's important whether they were honest from the start. If the author had known the ex's gender identity before getting into the relationship, maybe they wouldn't have started it. But since the transition happened during the relationship, the author might feel conflicted now.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of respect. Even if someone's sexuality means they can't date someone of a certain gender, it's about how they handle the breakup. The author tried to be gentle, but the ex is upset. The author isn't being discriminatory against trans people per se, but rather acting according to their own sexual orientation. However, if the breakup is framed as the ex's identity being a problem, that could be hurtful. The line between personal preference and discrimination is thin here.\n\nIn terms of societal views, being trans is a valid identity, and respecting that is important. If the author's issue is solely about their own sexuality, that's different from transphobia. For example, a straight person might not date another man, regardless of the man being cis or trans. So in that case, the author isn't wrong for acting on their sexuality. But the way the breakup is handled and the ex's reaction might depend on other factors, like whether the author was supportive during the transition process.\n\nThe author also mentioned subtle comments from the ex about feeling more like a guy. Did they ignore those cues, or were they truly misunderstood? If the author didn't engage in conversations about the ex's identity before the transition, that might be a point of criticism. However, the ex might not have been open about it yet, so the author can't be blamed for not knowing.\n\nIn summary, the author's reasoning is based on their sexual orientation, which is a personal choice. They are not wrong for acting on their feelings of not wanting to date a guy. However, there's a consideration of how the breakup was handled and whether it was respectful. The key is whether the author is being disrespectful to the trans identity or just making a decision based on their own sexuality. If they're not transphobic, then they aren't in the wrong. But if the ex feels invalidated, that's a different matter.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting on their own sexual orientation and not because of transphobia. Their reasoning is about personal preference in partners, which is valid. However, the way the breakup was handled might affect the ex's feelings, but the author isn't inherently wrong for choosing to end the relationship based on their sexuality.\n"
