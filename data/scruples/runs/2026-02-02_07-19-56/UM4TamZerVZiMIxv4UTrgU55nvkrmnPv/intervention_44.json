I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The person is in high school and in a relationship with someone they refer to as their ex-SO. The ex-SO is biologically female but identifies as trans and now wants to be referred to as a guy. The author is a straight guy and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up because of this, but the ex feels the author is being an asshole. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the core issue here. The author's sexuality is a key point. They identify as straight, which typically means they are attracted to the opposite sex. The ex-SO came out as trans, which changes the author's perception of the relationship. The author is not being bigoted against trans people but is expressing their own sexual orientation. However, the ex feels rejected and treated poorly.\n\nNow, societal norms and understanding of gender identity are evolving. Trans people often face significant challenges in being accepted for their true selves. If the ex-SO was transitioning, it's crucial that the author supports their identity. The author's decision to break up based on their sexuality could be seen as not accepting the ex-SO for who they are now. But the author isn't being transphobic; they're being honest about their own feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to be gentle in the breakup, which might show they cared about the relationship. But maybe the issue is that the author didn't support the ex-SO's identity, which is a fundamental aspect of who they are. If the ex-SO's identity is central to their self-understanding, then the author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as invalidating that identity.\n\nI should also think about consent and respect. The author might believe they're honest about their feelings, but the ex feels it's a rejection of their identity. However, the author isn't rejecting the person as a person but their new identity as a man. This could be a clash of personal boundaries and self-identity.\n\nAnother angle: the author's sexuality is valid. If they are straight, they might not have the capacity or desire to be in a relationship with someone they perceive as the same gender. But the issue here is whether the author is respecting the ex-SO's identity. If the author is only dating someone based on their biological sex and not their gender identity, that's a personal choice, but it might not be considered right in the context of respecting the ex-SO's identity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't being malicious, but the act of breaking up could be hurtful. However, the author is also honest about their feelings. The question is whether honesty about one's sexuality absolves them of being in the wrong. Society often encourages people to stay in relationships despite personal discomfort, but in this case, the author's comfort and self-understanding are also factors.\n\nI think the key point is whether the author is respecting the ex-SO's identity. If the author doesn't accept the ex-SO as a man, then the breakup might be more about not accepting their identity, which could be seen as wrong. However, if the author is being honest about their own feelings regarding their sexuality, it's complicated. But in many cases, people are encouraged to support their partner's identity, even if it changes the relationship's nature. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for not supporting the ex-SO's gender identity, even if their own sexuality is a factor.\n"
