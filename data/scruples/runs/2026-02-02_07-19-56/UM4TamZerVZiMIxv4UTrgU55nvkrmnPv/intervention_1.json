I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after breaking up with their partner who is trans. The author says they're straight and don't want to date a guy, trans or not. The partner was biologically female but transitioned and now identifies as male. The author broke up because their sexuality doesn't align with the partner's new gender identity.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The author is in high school, so they're likely around 17 or 18. They had been dating for almost a year, and the partner came out as trans. The author claims they're fine with trans people but not with being in a relationship with one. The partner is upset and calls the author an asshole.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, transitioning is a deeply personal journey. The author's decision might be based on their own sexuality, but the key issue here is whether it's wrong to end a relationship because one partner's gender identity changes. The author isn't rejecting the person's identity but the implications for their own sexual orientation.\n\nIn many discussions about relationships, authenticity is valued. If the author is straight, they might not be able to see themselves in a same-sex relationship, even if the partner was assigned female at birth. However, some might argue that the author is prioritizing their own preferences over the partner's identity. But others might say that it's okay for someone to be honest about their feelings and not force a relationship to continue if their orientation doesn't align with the partner's new identity.\n\nThe partner's reaction is also important. Feeling treated like an asshole could be because the author didn't handle the breakup sensitively enough. The author tried to be gentle, but maybe the approach still hurt. Also, the partner's question, \"Why does my gender matter?\" suggests they might have felt the author was focusing on the gender identity rather than the person. \n\nLegally and ethically, discrimination based on gender identity is a concern, but in the context of a personal relationship, it's more about mutual compatibility. The author isn't necessarily wrong for choosing not to continue a relationship if their orientation doesn't align. However, some might argue that the author should have considered the partner's journey and maybe explored the relationship further to understand their own feelings.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether you prioritize the individual's right to define their identity and the author's right to their own sexuality. If the author is being honest about their feelings without being discriminatory, they might not be in the wrong. But if the breakup is seen as invalidating the partner's identity, then they could be considered in the wrong. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are being honest about their sexuality, even if it's a difficult situation. The key point is that the author isn't opposing the partner's identity but their own attraction. However, others might disagree, but based on the information given, B seems more accurate.\n"
