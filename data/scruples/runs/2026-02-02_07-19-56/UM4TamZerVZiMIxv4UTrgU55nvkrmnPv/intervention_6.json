I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style \"Am I the asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a straight guy in a high school relationship with someone who is biologically female but has transitioned and now identifies as male. The author felt uncomfortable with the transition and broke up because he considered himself straight. The ex feels hurt and thinks the author is an asshole. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is about whether it's okay for someone to break up with their partner after the partner comes out as trans. The author's reasoning is about their own sexuality. But wait, straight people are typically attracted to people of the opposite sex. If the partner is now identifying as male, then from the author's perspective, he's no longer dating a woman. But does that make it valid to break up?\n\nI need to consider different angles. First, the concept of identity versus biology. The partner is trans, so they identify as male. The author's feelings are based on the partner's gender identity, not just biological sex. But the author is straight, so perhaps he's not emotionally or physically attracted to men, trans or not. Is that a valid reason to end the relationship?\n\nBut wait, maybe the author's issue isn't just about gender identity but about the transition itself. Could he have considered staying in the relationship if the partner's gender identity didn't affect his attraction? Or is his discomfort rooted in not understanding or accepting the transition, rather than his sexuality?\n\nAlso, the way the breakup was handled. The author tried to be gentle, but the ex feels hurt. Is the author wrong for prioritizing his own feelings over the partner's? Or is it okay to end a relationship when you realize it's not compatible?\n\nAnother point: the partner's right to transition. The author is breaking up because the partner's gender identity is different from what he expected. But the partner had the right to transition regardless. The author's decision isn't about the partner's identity but his own preferences. However, relationships require mutual acceptance. If the author couldn't accept the partner's identity, maybe the breakup is a necessary decision, but is it the wrong thing to do?\n\nI should also consider societal perspectives. There's a movement towards supporting trans rights and respecting their identities. If the author is breaking up because he's straight and not attracted to trans men, is that considered valid? Or is there a societal expectation that he should be able to accept the partner regardless?\n\nBut the author's perspective is that his sexuality is a fixed part of who he is. He's not choosing to be straight; it's part of his identity. So if the partner's gender identity doesn't align with his attraction, maybe it's not his fault. However, the impact on the partner is significant\u2014they feel rejected because of their identity.\n\nThis is a tough one. The author isn't being mean or transphobic per se; he's stating a personal preference. But the partner feels that the breakup is due to their gender, which can be hurtful. So, is the author in the wrong for ending the relationship based on his sexuality, or is he within his rights to prioritize his own feelings?\n\nI think the key here is understanding that while the author isn't being openly discriminatory, he is prioritizing his own preferences over the relationship. The partner's identity is valid, and the breakup might be seen as rejecting the partner's true self. But from the author's point of view, he's acting on his sexuality. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the right because he's not transphobic, just realizing his attraction isn't there. But others might argue that by entering into a relationship with someone and then breaking up over their gender, it's dismissive of their identity. So, maybe the answer isn't clear-cut. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks yes, but I'm conflicted. \n\nWait, the partner had been making subtle comments about feeling more like a guy before the transition. The author might not have noticed or understood. So, perhaps the author didn't have all the information when entering the relationship. Now, with new information about the partner's identity, he's realizing it's not compatible. Is that a valid reason?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the partner's identity is real, and the author's feelings are valid as well. So maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's acting on his genuine feelings and sexuality, even if it hurts the partner. But I'm still not entirely sure. Some might say that by breaking up, the author is invalidating the partner's identity, hence in the wrong.\n"
