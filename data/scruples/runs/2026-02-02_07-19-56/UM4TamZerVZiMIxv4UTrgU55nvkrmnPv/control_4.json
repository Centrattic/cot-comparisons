I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a breakup after the SO comes out as trans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a straight guy, and his SO is trans male (biologically female, transitioning to male). The author broke up because he doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. The SO is upset and treating the author like an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that his sexuality matters, so he can't date a guy. The SO is arguing that since the author liked them as a person, gender shouldn't matter. But the author's orientation is a valid reason for him to not proceed with the relationship.\n\nBut wait, trans people's gender identity is valid. If someone is transitioning, they are considered their identified gender. So if the author identifies as straight, and his SO is now identifying as male, the author's perspective might be that he's dating a guy now. However, the SO probably felt that their gender was female when they started dating, which complicates things. The author might not have considered how his decision affects the SO's feelings, especially if the SO felt they were still the same person internally. The author tried to be gentle, but the SO is hurt. The question is whether the author had a valid reason or if he's wrong for ending the relationship because of the SO's transition.\n\nIn some views, the author isn't in the wrong because his sexuality is a personal choice. However, others might argue that the person's gender identity is valid, and the author should adjust his perspective. But if the author is truly straight and can't reconcile his feelings, it's not his fault. However, the way the breakup was handled could matter. If the author didn't give enough support or understanding, maybe he's at fault. But according to the story, he tried to let them down gently. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong because his sexual preference is a valid reason. But there's a debate here. Alternatively, some might say that the author should accept the SO's identity and adjust his feelings. However, in reality, people can't be forced to change their sexual orientation. So the answer is B.\n"
