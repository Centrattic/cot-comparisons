I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for breaking up with their SO after the SO came out as trans. The author is a straight guy who realized he's not interested in dating a trans man, even though he's okay with trans people in general. The SO is upset and treating the author badly, and the author is confused if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's SO is biologically female and has transitioned to being male. The author is straight and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up after the SO came out as trans. The SO is upset and thinks the author is an asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to end the relationship. The author's reasoning is that their sexuality makes their gender matter, so they can't be with a guy. The SO's perspective is that their gender identity is valid, and the author's decision is based on that identity.\n\nI need to think about whether the author is being disrespectful. The author claims they're not transphobic, just straight. But is it possible that their reaction is transphobic? Maybe the author is conflating gender identity with sexual orientation. If the author was okay with trans people in general but not in this specific case, that might be a problem. Also, the author might be invalidating their SO's identity by breaking up based on gender.\n\nAnother angle: The SO was in the process of transitioning, and the author ended the relationship right after the SO came out. That could be seen as a rejection of the SO's identity. Even if the author is straight, the SO's gender is their true identity, so the author is ending the relationship because the SO is being authentic. That might be hurtful.\n\nBut the author is also honest about their preferences. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize one's own sexuality over a partner's identity. Some might argue that the author is within their rights to end the relationship based on their own feelings, while others might see it as transphobic because it's rejecting the SO's identity.\n\nThe author tried to be gentle, but the SO is upset. The author might be in the wrong because they're not accepting their SO's identity, even if they're not transphobic. It's possible that by ending the relationship, the author is contributing to a transphobic environment, even if unintentionally.\n\nAlternatively, if the author is truly straight and not transphobic, then ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong. Sexual orientation is about whom one is attracted to, so if the author isn't attracted to men, trans or otherwise, then it's a matter of personal preference.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The SO was biologically female, and the author was dating them as a woman. Now the SO identifies as male. The author's attraction might have been to the female aspect, and the SO's transition changes that. However, if the author had known earlier, maybe they wouldn't have dated them. But since the transition was recent, the author is facing a conflict between their identity and the SO's.\n\nSome people might argue that the author is wrong because they're ending the relationship due to the SO's identity, which is a core part of who they are. Others might say it's about the author's own sexuality and they can't be blamed for that.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person is inconsiderate or invalidating. The author might be seen as invalidating their SO's identity by breaking up, which could be considered wrong. However, if the author is honest about their preferences and not acting out of prejudice, maybe it's not their fault.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is transphobic or simply acting on their sexual orientation. If it's the latter, then it's not their fault. But if it's a rejection of the SO's identity despite being trans, then it's wrong. The author's statement that they're a straight guy and it's weird to date a guy, trans or not, suggests it's about their sexuality, not transphobia. However, some might argue that the author's reaction is still transphobic because it's a rejection based on gender identity.\n\nSo, the answer could be split, but based on the AITA context, people might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they're ending the relationship due to the SO's identity, even if it's framed as their own sexuality. The community often values acceptance and support, so invalidating someone's identity might be seen as wrong, regardless of the author's intentions.\n"
