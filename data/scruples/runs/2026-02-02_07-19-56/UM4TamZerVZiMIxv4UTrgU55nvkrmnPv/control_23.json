I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a high school relationship where the author breaks up with their partner after finding out they're trans. The author mentions they're a straight guy and don't want to date a guy, trans or not. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of the situation. The partner came out as trans, which the author wasn't aware of before. The author's reasoning is based on their sexuality. But wait, isn't being trans about gender identity, not biological sex? The author says they're okay with trans people but not with dating them. But if the partner was assigned female at birth, does that make a difference?\n\nI remember that in many cases, a trans man (someone assigned female at birth but identifies as male) is still considered a male in terms of gender identity. If the author is straight, they might be attracted to women biologically, but if their partner is a trans man, their sexual orientation might influence how they view the relationship. However, I think the key here is whether the author's actions are discriminatory.\n\nThe author is making a choice based on their sexuality, which they claim is being a straight guy. But if the partner's gender identity is male, then the author is choosing not to date them because of their gender, which could be seen as valid from their perspective. However, some might argue that the author's focus on biological sex (since the partner was assigned female) is problematic and could be transphobic. \n\nWait, but the partner is trans and identifies as a male. If the author is straight and only interested in dating women (biologically), then from the author's standpoint, they're dating a man now. But if their orientation is more about attraction to women in terms of gender identity, then the author might not be in the wrong. It's a bit confusing because definitions can vary. \n\nAlso, the partner is upset because they feel the author is rejecting them based on their gender identity. The author is trying to be respectful but can't reconcile their own sexuality with the situation. \n\nI think the main point is whether the author's decision is considered discriminatory. If the author is straight and their orientation is about attraction to women (regardless of biology), then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the author is focusing on the partner's biological sex rather than their gender identity, that could be transphobic. \n\nBut the author says they're fine with trans people, just not wanting to date someone who is a man. If the partner is a trans man, then the author is choosing not to date a man because they're straight. That seems valid from their perspective, even if others might have different views. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is invalidating the partner's identity by focusing on biological sex. But the author isn't attacking the partner's identity; they're just stating their own sexual orientation. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they're acting according to their own sexuality, even if others might disagree. However, if the author is transphobic, then they would be in the wrong. But the author claims they're not transphobic, just straight. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a personal choice based on their sexuality, even if it's uncomfortable for the partner. The situation is complicated, but the author isn't being malicious.\n"
