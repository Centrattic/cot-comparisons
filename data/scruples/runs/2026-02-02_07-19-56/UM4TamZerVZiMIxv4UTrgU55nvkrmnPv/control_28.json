I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person broke up with their partner after finding out they're transgender. The ex-partner is biological female but identifies as male now. The author is a straight guy who doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they're in high school, which might affect their perspective. They said they're not against trans people but are straight, so they can't date a guy. The partner felt hurt and accused them of being an asshole. \n\nI should think about the basics of relationships. If someone's gender identity changes, does that automatically mean the relationship is over? The author's decision is based on their sexuality. If being straight means being exclusively attracted to women, then the author might feel that their partner is now a man, so they can't continue the relationship. But the partner was biologically female when the relationship started. \n\nSome might argue that the person's identity is about their gender, not their biology. The author might be seeing the person as a different gender now, so their feelings aren't aligned with their sexual orientation. On the other hand, if the partner transitioned, the author might need to reconsider their stance. But the author is clear they can't do that. \n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship because of a change in the partner's gender identity? That depends on the individual's beliefs and the circumstances. If the author is being honest about their feelings and not discriminatory, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're invalidating the partner's identity, that could be problematic. \n\nThe partner is upset, thinking the author is being mean. But the author is stating their truth. They tried to be gentle. In ethical terms, is it wrong to end a relationship when one's core feelings and identity don't align with the partner's? It's a personal choice, and unless there's coercion or discrimination, maybe it's not wrong. \n\nHowever, some might say that the author should have stayed if the partner was their true self. But the author's sexuality is a personal aspect they can't change. So, they're not in the wrong for being honest, even if it's hard. \n\nSo, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
