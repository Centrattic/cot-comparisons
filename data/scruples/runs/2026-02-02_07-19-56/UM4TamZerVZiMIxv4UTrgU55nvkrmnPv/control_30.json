I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their partner after finding out they're trans. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author is a straight guy in high school, dates someone who is biologically female but identifies as trans and now presents as male. The author feels their sexuality is such that they don't want to date a guy, trans or not. They broke up after the partner came out as trans, and now the ex is upset. The author is questioning their own actions.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's reasoning is based on their sexuality. They identify as straight, so if their partner is now identifying as male, they feel it's a problem. But the question is whether this is a valid reason for breaking up. \n\nFrom a standpoint of consent and personal choice, people have the right to date who they want, but also to end relationships if they feel it's not compatible. However, the issue might be more about the author's understanding of gender identity. The partner transitioned, and the author is still seeing them through a biological lens rather than their gender identity. \n\nIn many perspectives, a person's gender identity is their true self, so if someone identifies as a different gender, others should respect that. However, the author's attraction is based on the biological sex they were assigned at birth. That can be a point of contention. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, if the author is honest and respectful in their decision, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they are being dismissive or not respecting the partner's identity, they might be. The author says they tried to be gentle, so maybe they're not malicious. \n\nAnother angle: The partner might feel the breakup is due to the author not accepting their identity, which could be hurtful. But the author's stance is about their own sexuality. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn some cases, people's sexual orientation is tied to gender identity, not biological sex. So if the author is straight, they are attracted to people who identify as the opposite gender. If the partner now identifies as male, then from the author's perspective, they're dating someone of the same gender, which conflicts with their orientation. But others might argue that the author's orientation is more about biological sex, and that's a different perspective. \n\nSo, depending on how one views gender identity versus biological sex, the answer could vary. If society leans towards respecting self-identified gender, then the author might be in the wrong for not accepting that. If someone's orientation is strictly about biological sex, then the author isn't wrong for not being attracted to someone who is biologically the opposite but now identifies as the same gender.\n\nBut I think the key point is that the author is being honest about their feelings and sexuality. They aren't being disrespectful, just making a decision based on their own orientation. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. The ex's reaction could be due to feeling rejected or not accepted, but the author's actions are within their right to make personal choices about their relationships.\n"
