I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their partner because the partner is trans is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight guy. His partner, who was biologically female, came out as trans and now identifies as a guy. The author realized that he's not interested in dating a guy, trans or not, so he broke up. The ex is upset, saying the author is an asshole. The question is if the author is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal choice in relationships and respect for gender identity. The author is being honest about his sexuality and his feelings. Being straight means he's attracted to women, and now that his partner is identifying as a man, he feels it's no longer a match. \n\nBut wait, does being trans affect the biological sex in a way that might matter for the author's perspective? The partner was assigned female at birth but now identifies as male. The author might see this as a change in the partner's gender, which conflicts with his own orientation. However, in many discussions, the focus is on gender identity rather than biological sex. \n\nThe author claims he's fine with trans people in general but not with dating a trans man because of his straight identity. Is that a valid reason? Some people might argue that if the author was okay with dating a cisgender man, then the trans status shouldn't matter. However, others might say that sexual orientation is about the gender one is attracted to, and if the partner's gender identity is male, then the author's attraction is towards a different gender now. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of how the breakup was handled. The author tried to be gentle, but if the partner felt disrespected, that's a separate issue. However, the author didn't reject the person based on their trans identity in a discriminatory way; he's just stating his own orientation. \n\nIt's important to note that everyone has the right to their own feelings and choices. The author isn't obligated to maintain a relationship if the other person's identity conflicts with his own sexuality. However, some might argue that the author should reevaluate his understanding of being straight, considering that gender identity is a core part of a person. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't denying the partner's identity. They acknowledged the partner's trans status and respected the name/pronouns change. The issue is about his own attraction. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to a mismatch in attraction. \n\nBut there's also the potential for the author to consider if his feelings are based on prejudice. If he's okay with trans people in general but not in a romantic context, that's personal. However, if he's not being accepting of the partner's identity, that's different. In this case, the author seems to accept the partner's identity but is not attracted to men, which is a valid reason for ending the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting according to his own sexuality. However, it's a complex situation where both perspectives need to be respected. The key is that the author isn't discriminating based on the partner's trans identity but is following his own feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
