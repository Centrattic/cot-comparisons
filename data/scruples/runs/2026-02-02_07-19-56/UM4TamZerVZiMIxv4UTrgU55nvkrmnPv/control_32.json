I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their trans partner is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a straight guy who's been dating someone who's biologically female but is now transitioning. The author realized that since they're straight, they don't want to date a guy, trans or not. The partner is upset and treats the author badly, leading to the question: is the author at fault?\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about relationships and identity. The key here is the author's self-identification as straight. If someone identifies as straight and is in a relationship with a trans person, and that person's gender identity has changed, the author's feelings about their own sexuality might affect the relationship's viability. \n\nThe author mentions they are not being disrespectful to trans people but simply don't want to date a guy. That's a personal choice, and if the author is being honest about their feelings, it's their right to end the relationship. However, maybe the author could have handled the breakup more sensitively. The partner might feel rejected or invalidated, especially if they were in the process of transitioning and the author didn't consider their feelings or the timing. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, people have the right to date who they want, and if their sexual orientation changes the dynamics, they aren't obligated to continue a relationship. The author isn't discriminating based on gender identity per se, but rather their own sexual orientation. The issue here is the author's honesty and respect in ending the relationship. They tried to be gentle, which is a positive step. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author didn't support their partner through the transition and ended the relationship abruptly, which could be seen as insensitive. But if the author is clear that their feelings are based on their own orientation and not on any rejection of the partner's identity, it's a personal choice. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author could have handled it better, the act of breaking up based on their own sexuality isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
