I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their SO after the SO came out as trans. The scenario is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a straight guy who's been dating someone who's biologically female but is trans and now identifies as male. The author broke up because their sexuality is straight, meaning they only date cisgender women. The ex is upset and treating the author as an asshole. The question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nI know that being trans is about a person's gender identity, not their biological sex. So the author's SO is trans male, meaning they identify as male. The author admits they're straight, so they only want to date people of the opposite gender. Since the author's SO is now identifying as male, the author feels it's not compatible with their sexuality. \n\nFrom a standpoint of respect and support, when someone comes out as trans, it's important to acknowledge their identity. However, the author isn't rejecting the person for who they are but rather their own sexual orientation. If the author is truly straight, they may not feel physically or romantically attracted to males, trans or cis. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author was dating someone who was biologically female but is trans. If the author was dating them as a woman and they transition, does that change the dynamic? The author might have developed a relationship with someone they now see as a different gender. But the author's SO is asserting their identity as male, which is valid. \n\nThe author's decision to break up is based on their own sexuality, not on any rejection of the trans identity. It's not about being trans, but about the author's capacity to be attracted to a male. However, some might argue that by staying in the relationship, the author could support their SO through transition, even if they're not attracted to males. But the author's feeling that it's \"weird\" and not wanting to date a guy is a personal choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the SO might feel that the author is invalidating their identity by ending the relationship now. The author's SO could see it as a rejection of their true self. But if the author's orientation is strictly heterosexual, there's a conflict here. It's a situation where two people have incompatible sexual orientations and gender identities.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't being discriminatory. Discrimination against trans people is against their identity, but the author is not doing that. They're being honest about their own sexuality. However, in terms of emotional support, the author might not be showing enough empathy to their SO's feelings. The SO might feel abandoned when they're going through a significant identity change.\n\nIn the context of a supportive relationship, ideally, the author would work through this. But if the author's feelings are genuine and not based on prejudice, it's a matter of mutual compatibility. The author isn't wrong for breaking up because they're being truthful about their feelings. However, the way they handled it could be more empathetic. The answer might depend on societal views on trans issues and how the author's actions are perceived in terms of support versus rejection.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong for breaking up due to their own sexuality, but they might be in the wrong in how they handled the breakup or for not considering the emotional impact. However, the core issue is about personal choice and authenticity. Since the author is being honest and not discriminatory, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the expectation is to stay in a relationship regardless of changing gender identity, then A (in the wrong). It's a tricky balance between respecting one's own identity and supporting the partner's.\n"
