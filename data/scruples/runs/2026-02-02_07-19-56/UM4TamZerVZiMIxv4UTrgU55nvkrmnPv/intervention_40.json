For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves breaking up with an SO who is trans. The author mentions they're a straight guy and found out their partner is trans, leading to the breakup. They're being called an asshole, and the user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in high school, and the SO transitioned later. The key points here are the author's sexuality and the SO's transition. The author claims they're straight and don't want to date a guy, trans or not. The SO was open about their gender identity, and the author decided to break up. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a rights perspective, the SO's identity is valid, and the author's decision to end the relationship based on that could be seen as invalidating. However, the author is also honest about their sexuality. But in terms of ethical responsibility, respecting someone's gender identity is important. The author could have tried to work through the issue, but instead, they ended it immediately. The SO's feelings of being treated poorly might stem from feeling rejected because of their identity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel confused about their own sexuality when faced with this change. But the SO's identity is their reality. The author's decision to break up might be seen as necessary for themselves, but the way they handled it could be problematic if it was abrupt without support. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that the author didn't force the relationship and was honest about their stance, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they dismissed the SO's identity, that's an issue. \n\nWait, but in the scenario, the author states they're okay with trans people but not with dating a guy. The SO's identity is as a guy, so the author is choosing not to date them because they're a guy. That's a direct contradiction to the SO's identity. The author is acting based on their own sexuality, which is valid, but the SO might feel rejected for being trans. However, the author isn't rejecting them for being trans specifically, but for identifying as male. So it's more about the author's sexuality not aligning with their attraction. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for being straight and not being attracted to men, trans or not. But they could be in the wrong if they didn't respect the SO's identity. The key here is whether the breakup was handled respectfully. The author tried to be gentle, but the SO felt treated poorly. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is justified in ending the relationship based on their sexuality. Since the author is honest and not being disrespectful, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the SO felt invalidated, there's a conflict. However, the author isn't obligated to remain in a relationship if their feelings have changed due to the partner's identity. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is sensitive. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Another angle is that the author dismissed the SO's identity by focusing on the gender aspect. But the author's stance is about their own sexuality. It's a tough call. I think the author is not in the wrong because they're acting according to their own orientation, even if it's difficult for the SO. So, the answer is B.\n"
