I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with their SO after finding out they're trans. The SO is biologically female and had been making subtle comments about feeling more like a guy. The author is a straight guy and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. The SO is upset and treating the author as an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is in high school, which is a time when people are still figuring out their identities and relationships. The SO came out as trans after being in a relationship for almost a year. The author's reason for breaking up is their sexuality, stating they're a straight guy and don't want to date a guy. The SO is confused why the gender matters, which is a valid point because the author previously dated them as a female. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, if someone's sexuality is a key factor in their ability to be in a relationship, it's not necessarily wrong for them to end the relationship upon realizing their partner's gender identity doesn't align with their own. However, there are nuances here. The author might have had the opportunity to address this earlier if the SO had made subtle comments. But the SO only came out as trans after some time. The author's decision is based on their own sexuality, which is a personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO might feel that the author didn't consider their feelings and the effort they put into the relationship. The author tried to be gentle, but breaking up after a year could still be hurtful. However, the author isn't being discriminatory; they're being honest about their own preferences. The SO's frustration is understandable, but the author's actions are based on their own identity and comfort.\n\nI should also consider societal context. Being trans is a legitimate identity, and the author isn't wrong for not being comfortable with that. However, some might argue that the author should have been more flexible with their definition of sexuality. But straight people identifying as such have the right to date people of the opposite sex as per their own understanding. The author isn't transphobic; they're just not interested in dating a guy. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who misrepresented their gender identity. The SO was upfront once they were ready, and the author made a decision based on new information. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to date someone whose gender identity conflicts with their own. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
