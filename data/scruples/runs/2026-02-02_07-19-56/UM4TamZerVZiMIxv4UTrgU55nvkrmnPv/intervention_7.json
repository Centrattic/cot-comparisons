I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a high school relationship where the author broke up with their significant other after the SO revealed they're trans. The author is straight and doesn't want to date a guy, trans or not. They mentioned they had subtle clues before but didn't realize until the haircut and binder. The SO is biological female but identifies as male now. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author isn't being bigoted against trans people, they just state they're straight and don't want to date a guy. The problem here is whether that's a valid reason to break up once the gender identity changes. The SO was transitioning, so the author's sexuality might conflict with continuing the relationship. But is it wrong to end a relationship because your partner's gender identity changes and it conflicts with your sexual orientation?\n\nI should think about consent and mutual agreement. The author didn't know the SO was trans when they started dating. Once that information came out, the author realized it wasn't compatible with their sexual orientation. But the SO might have felt that the author should accept them regardless of gender identity. However, the author is clear they're not transphobic, just straight. \n\nAnother angle: did the author have any indication before? The SO made subtle comments, but the author thought they were misinterpreting. The author isn't to blame for not picking up on hints they didn't understand. The breakup happened when the SO was explicit about their identity. The author tried to be gentle, so maybe they handled it with care. \n\nThe SO is upset and calling the author an asshole, but maybe that's because they were hoping the author would stay. The author isn't lying or being cruel; they're honest about their feelings. However, some might argue that the author should have been more supportive or that transitioning doesn't change the person's essence. \n\nBut sexuality is about attraction to certain genders. If the author is straight and their partner is transitioning to a different gender, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. The author isn't rejecting the person for who they are, but for their gender identity. It's a matter of compatibility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They aren't being transphobic, just honest about their feelings. The SO might have wanted the relationship to continue despite the change, but the author's orientation is a personal choice they can't change. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
