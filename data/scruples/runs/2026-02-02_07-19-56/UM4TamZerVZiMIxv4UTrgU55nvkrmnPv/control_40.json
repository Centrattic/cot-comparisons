I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with their partner who is trans. The partner transitioned, and the author identifies as straight, so they decided to end the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is in high school, which is a time of personal growth and figuring out one's identity. The partner transitioned after a year of dating, so the author might not have known they were trans beforehand. The author states they are straight, which means they are only attracted to women. Now that the partner is presenting as male, the author feels it's not compatible. \n\nBut wait, the partner was biologically female when they started dating. So the core issue here is the author's sexuality and their ability to accept the partner's transition. The author says they don't want to date a guy, trans or not, because they're straight. The partner is upset and feels the author is being an asshole.\n\nNow, I need to think about the ethics here. Is the author wrong for ending the relationship because of their sexual orientation? Sexual orientation is about who someone is attracted to. If someone is straight and their partner transitions to the opposite gender, the attraction might shift. But some might argue that love shouldn't be conditional on gender. However, the author isn't rejecting the partner for being trans per se, but because of their own sexuality. \n\nAnother angle is the partner's feelings. The author tried to be gentle but broke up. The partner feels hurt, which is understandable. But the author isn't discriminating based on trans identity; they are acting on their own sexual preferences. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the author had known the partner was trans before dating, would they have started the relationship? Maybe not. But the partner transitioned after the relationship started. The author might need to process this change, but it's also their right to realize their feelings. \n\nI should also consider societal perspectives. Some might say that the author is wrong because the partner is still the same person, just with a different gender identity. Others might say the author is not wrong because they can't change their sexuality. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complicated. The author isn't being malicious; they're being honest about their preferences. But the partner's feelings are valid too. The answer depends on whether one views sexual orientation as a valid reason for ending a relationship when the partner's gender identity changes. \n\nI think the correct answer here is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting on their own sexual orientation, which is a personal preference they can't change. But the way they handled it might be considered insensitive, though the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it well. So, B seems correct.\n"
