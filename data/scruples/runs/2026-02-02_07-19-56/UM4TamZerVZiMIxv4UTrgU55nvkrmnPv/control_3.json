I'll be referring to my ex-SO as they cause I'm not sure how to use he/she in this context. For context, we're in high school. \n\nThey are biologically female, and I've been dating them for close to a year. They'd been making pretty subtle comments for a while about hoe they felt more like a guy, but I was mostly sure I had misinterpreted it or something. Then a week ago, they got their hair cut and started wearing a breast binder. I asked them about it, and they straight up told me they're trans and to refer to them as a guy now. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fine with trans people. But I don't want to date one, because I'm a straight guy. So to me it would be weird dating a guy, trans or not. They said, 'but you like me, right? Why does my gender matter?' I think, because of my sexuality, it *does matter*. I tried to let them down gently, but yeah, I broke up with them. \n\nSince then they have been treating me like I'm an asshole. Am i? \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with their SO who is trans. The author mentions they're straight and didn't realize their SO is trans until they came out. The SO is biologically female but identifies as male now. The author breaks up because of their sexuality and is being treated badly by the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal, but personal relationships are different. The author isn't discriminating in a legal sense but rather based on their own sexual orientation. However, some might argue that the author is invalidating the SO's identity by ending the relationship because of it.\n\nThen there's the perspective of respecting the SO's identity. The author knew the person as a girl for a year and then learned they identify as male. The author's decision is based on their sexuality\u2014being straight and not wanting to date a male, trans or not. But if the SO's gender identity is real to them, the author's refusal to continue the relationship might be seen as not accepting them for who they are.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong if they are being honest about their feelings. Sexual orientation is about who you're attracted to, and if the author's orientation is such that they're only attracted to women, but their partner is now identifying as male, then maybe it's a matter of personal preference. But some might argue that trans men are still part of the female gender in some contexts, though that's a contentious point.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are respectful. The author tried to be gentle, but the breakup is based on their own sexuality. However, the SO might feel that the author is dismissing their identity. It's a complex issue. In terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for acting according to their own feelings, but others might see it as invalidating the trans identity. However, legally and socially, the author isn't breaking any laws or clear ethical guidelines by ending the relationship for personal reasons. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
