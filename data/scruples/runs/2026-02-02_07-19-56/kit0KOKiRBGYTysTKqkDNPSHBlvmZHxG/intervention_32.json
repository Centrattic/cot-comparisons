For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord chat. The author's friends have been in the chat for two years, and the girlfriend wanted to join because she was curious. The author says it's just gaming and banter, and he's worried she wouldn't fit in or understand the humor. He's also worried it might ruin the chat and that it's an invasion of privacy. The girlfriend feels he's hiding things and wants to include her, but the author isn't sure.\n\nHmm. So, the author is concerned about privacy and group dynamics. The girlfriend feels excluded and maybe insecure. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: private group, different interests, fear of misinterpretation. Those are valid. But maybe the girlfriend's need for inclusion and trust is also important. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical, but is it emotionally wrong? The girlfriend might feel neglected, but the author's reasons are about privacy and group dynamics. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Like maybe a separate group for her, or selective sharing. But the author doesn't want to do that. The main issue is the conflict between privacy and inclusion. The author's privacy is a personal right, but in a relationship, transparency is also important. But if the author is not sharing harmful or secret things, maybe he's justified. The girlfriend's reaction might be about trust and feeling left out. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not violating any rules, but maybe he could have explained better or found a compromise. However, the girlfriend's insistence on joining a private, male-dominated gaming group where she doesn't fit in might be unreasonable. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but genuine concerns. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried explaining but she didn't accept the analogy to her group chats. Maybe the author isn't wrong, but he could work on addressing her feelings of exclusion. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Since he's not breaching any trust or doing something harmful, maybe the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because his reasons are valid and the chat is private. The girlfriend's perspective is valid too, but that doesn't make him wrong.\n"
