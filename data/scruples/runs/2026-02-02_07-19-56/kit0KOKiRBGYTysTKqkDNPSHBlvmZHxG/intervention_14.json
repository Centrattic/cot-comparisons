For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord chat. The friends have been there for two years, and the girlfriend has been asking to join for two months.\n\nThe author argues that the chat is just gaming and banter, and that she wouldn't fit in since she's not into games or their humor. He also mentions privacy concerns, like their sarcastic comments and not wanting to ruin the group dynamic. The girlfriend is upset, feeling excluded and thinking he's hiding something, even though he hasn't actually shared anything negative about her.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are privacy versus inclusion. The author is protective of his group's private space and doesn't want outsiders, especially someone not close to the group, to join. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels neglected and wants to be included in his social circle. \n\nHe tried explaining that it's different from her text messages with her friends, but she doesn't agree. She's accusing him of hiding things. The author isn't willing to let her in because he thinks it could ruin the chat and that she wouldn't understand the dynamics. \n\nI need to consider if there's a middle ground or if the author is being unreasonable. Maybe he could create a separate channel for her or have one-on-one chats with her about the group's activities. But he's firm that including her would kill the chat. \n\nIs it fair to exclude her entirely? Relationships often require compromise. The girlfriend is expressing a need for inclusion, which is valid. The author's privacy is also valid. However, completely refusing without any compromise might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the author has valid reasons: the chat's culture is specific, and introducing someone not part of that could disrupt it. Also, the privacy of the group is important. The girlfriend's analogy about his texting with her friends isn't the same because those are different contexts. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything harmful; he's just keeping his private group private. The girlfriend's insecurity might be causing her to overreact. But maybe the author could have explained better and offered alternatives. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person is in the wrong if they're being unnecessarily secretive or withholding. But here, the author isn't hiding something sinister. He's just maintaining boundaries. So maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
