For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord server. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting to be included, but the guy feels it's a private group where she wouldn't fit in and that including her might ruin the dynamic. The girlfriend is upset, feeling excluded and like he's hiding something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that the Discord is a private, gaming-focused group with inside jokes and sarcasm, and he doesn't think she'd fit in. He also mentions that it's not about hiding things but keeping the group's vibe intact. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels like he's not being open and that she's not trusted, leading to her feeling excluded in their relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to explain why she wouldn't fit in, but she doesn't see it the same way. The girlfriend's perspective is that couples should address issues that cause problems, which she sees as a valid concern. The author is concerned about privacy and group dynamics. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend is feeling neglected or untrusted, the author's refusal might be contributing to that. However, he's also not obligated to share every part of his personal space. The line between privacy and inclusion in a relationship can be blurry. \n\nThe author's argument is that the group isn't for her, but maybe there's a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her or having one-on-one discussions. The girlfriend's frustration is about not being included, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nThe author's stance is about maintaining the group's privacy and dynamics, but if it's causing significant distress to the girlfriend, maybe some compromise is needed. However, he's not necessarily being selfish; he's protecting his space. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's feelings are valid and he's not making an effort to find a solution, he might be. But if he's justified in keeping the group private, then maybe not. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not obligated to include her in his private group, and his concerns about privacy and fit are valid. However, there's a case for A if he's not considering her feelings enough. But the key points are his legitimate reasons and the girlfriend's misunderstanding. So probably B.\n"
