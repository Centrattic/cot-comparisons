For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author's girlfriend has been asking to join their private Discord server for two months. The author says it's a small group of friends who game and chat, and they don't think she'd fit in because she's not into gaming, the humor is different, and the banter is sarcastic. The author is worried that adding her would ruin the chat and invade their privacy. The girlfriend is upset, feeling like he's hiding something, even though he hasn't actually done anything wrong. The author is caught between his privacy and his partner's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships and privacy. In many relationships, partners expect a certain level of openness and inclusion. The girlfriend might feel excluded or not trusted, especially since the author is being asked to share a part of his social life. However, the author has valid concerns about privacy and the nature of the group. The group is private, and he's concerned that including an outsider might change the dynamics, leading to discomfort or awkwardness.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's request could be seen as reasonable. She wants to be part of his life and understand his interests. The author's refusal might be perceived as not valuing her inclusion or being overly secretive. The girlfriend's analogy about joining her group chat isn't the same because texting is more personal, but she's pushing to be included in a space that's not just for the author but his friends.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't doing anything harmful, but his refusal to include his girlfriend might be causing her distress. However, he has the right to his own social spaces. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to share that space. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain privacy and the group's dynamic. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like creating a separate, more inclusive chat for her. But the situation as presented doesn't mention that. The author's reasoning seems valid, and the girlfriend's feelings are understandable but perhaps not a direct fault of the author. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
