For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend wants to join their private Discord chat with friends. The author has a 2-year-old group, and the girlfriend has been asking for two months. The author says no because the chat is for gaming, sarcastic banter, and friends she doesn't know. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding things, even though he hasn't done anything.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning: the chat is private, friends aren't the girlfriend's friends, she isn't into gaming, and the humor might confuse her. They're worried she'd feel out of place and that her joining would ruin the chat. The girlfriend compares it to the author wanting to join her group chat, but he argues it's different because the Discord is public but private. She feels it's about trust and transparency.\n\nSo, is the author being unreasonable? On one hand, the author has the right to privacy in their own group. If the chat is meant for a specific group of friends with shared interests, adding someone who doesn't fit in might not be necessary. The author isn't doing anything harmful by not letting her join. But on the other hand, the girlfriend might feel left out, especially if she sees it as a lack of openness. The author could find a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her to join if she's interested, or having a different chat together. However, the author is concerned about the group dynamic and privacy. Maybe the issue is communication. The author isn't hiding something, but the girlfriend's perception is that he is. The author could explain that it's about the group's nature, not her. But if the author is being rigid without offering alternatives, maybe that's where the problem is. Alternatively, if the group is truly private and the author isn't sharing anything inappropriate, then the author isn't in the wrong. It's about mutual respect. The answer probably depends on whether there's a way to include her without disrupting the group. Since the author is clear about the reasons and the group isn't for her, maybe they're not in the wrong. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
