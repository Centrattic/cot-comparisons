For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. The girlfriend has been asking for two months, and he's been saying no. His reasons are that the chat is just his friends gaming, they have inside jokes and sarcasm, and he doesn't want her to be confused or for her to think he's saying bad things about her. She feels it's a privacy issue and that he's not being open.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about privacy and the dynamics of his existing group. He's worried that adding someone who isn't part of their circle might disrupt the chat. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded and that her request is reasonable, comparing it to him joining her group chat. But the author argues that Discord is public, and even if it's private, she's not his friend's friend and might not fit in.\n\nI should think about relationship dynamics here. Communication is key. The author has tried to explain why he doesn't want her to join, but she's still upset. Maybe he could compromise, like creating a separate channel for her or including her in some way without fully integrating her into the main chat. However, if the main chat isn't hers to be part of, he might have a valid point about not wanting to change the group dynamic.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If the girlfriend is feeling left out and the author is making an effort to explain, maybe there's a middle ground. However, if the chat is private and he's not sharing personal info, he has a right to privacy. The issue is whether his refusal is reasonable. Since the group isn't hers and the content is specific to gaming and their humor, maybe it's not his fault. But maybe he's being too rigid. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
