For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they should be the asshole (AITA) for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord chat. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author has had a private Discord chat with friends for two years. The girlfriend has asked to join for two months, but the author keeps refusing. The friends are gamers, they have a certain kind of humor and banter that the girlfriend isn't part of. The author is concerned that adding her would ruin the dynamic of the chat because she's not into gaming or their humor. Also, the author is worried about privacy since the chat is private but the girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding things.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that the author isn't being open and is keeping her from being part of his life. She argues that joining the chat isn't the same as reading text messages, even though the author clarifies it's private. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy and that the chat's vibe would change if she joins. The girlfriend is now upset and thinks the author is being secretive.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are privacy vs. inclusion. The author has a right to privacy in their personal group, especially with friends. The girlfriend's request is about inclusion, which is a valid concern in a relationship. However, the author has legitimate reasons: the chat's dynamic, privacy concerns, and the potential for misunderstandings. \n\nThe author tried to explain the reasons, but the girlfriend isn't satisfied. The author isn't hiding something harmful; it's just a private group. The girlfriend might need to accept that some parts of his life are private. On the flip side, the author could consider alternative solutions, like creating a separate group for her to participate in if she wants to be included in some way. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything unethical or harmful. Privacy is a reasonable stance. So, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong). The problem is communication and differing needs, not one party being clearly wrong.\n"
