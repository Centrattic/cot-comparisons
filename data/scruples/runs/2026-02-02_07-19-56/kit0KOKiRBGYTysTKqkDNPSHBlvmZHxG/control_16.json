For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord chat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the Discord chat is a private group with friends, focused on gaming and casual banter. They don't want to include their girlfriend because she's not into gaming, might not understand their humor, and they fear it could ruin the group dynamic. They also emphasize the privacy aspect, comparing it to her being asked to read their texts.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels left out and thinks the author is hiding something. She argues that couples should address issues by making changes, like letting her join to resolve her concern. The author's refusal is causing her distress, and she's not convinced by their privacy argument since they claim the chat is private and not public.\n\nI should think about privacy vs. relationship dynamics. In relationships, there's often an expectation of openness, but there's also a right to privacy. The author isn't sharing information that's harmful, just keeping their private group separate. The girlfriend's demand might be about feeling included, but the author's reasons are about maintaining group dynamics and privacy. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to keep the chat separate? If the chat is indeed private and not harmful, the author isn't doing anything wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings of being excluded are valid, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The key is whether the author's actions are causing harm beyond the girlfriend's feelings. Since the chat isn't shared with others, the author isn't violating any trust or being deceptive. \n\nThe author tried to explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend isn't accepting it. The author isn't hiding something harmful; they're just not including another person in their existing group. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
