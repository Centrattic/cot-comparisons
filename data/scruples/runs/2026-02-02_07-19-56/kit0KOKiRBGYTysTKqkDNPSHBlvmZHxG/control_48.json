For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not letting their girlfriend join their private Discord chat.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the chat is a close-knit group of friends who game and have banter, which is a bit sarcastic and not for outsiders. The girlfriend has been asking for a while and got upset because she feels excluded. She argues that couples should share things and that the Discord isn't as private as texts. The author is worried that adding her would ruin the group dynamic and invade their privacy.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author has a right to privacy and to keep their friends' group as it is. If the chat is private, they can decide who's in. The girlfriend's analogy to text messages isn't quite right because Discord is more public even if it's private. But on the other hand, the girlfriend feels left out and is trying to include herself in the relationship by wanting to be part of the group. The author's refusal might be seen as not making an effort to include her, especially if the relationship is a significant part of their life.\n\nBut the key points are: the group is close friends, the content might not be suitable for her, and the author doesn't want to compromise the group's dynamic. Also, the girlfriend's concern is about transparency, but the author isn't hiding anything harmful. The author is worried about privacy and the group's vibe. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to privacy and group dynamics. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like a separate group for her or explaining the content better. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer is B, no. They aren't in the wrong for maintaining their privacy, but they might need to address the girlfriend's feelings differently.\n"
