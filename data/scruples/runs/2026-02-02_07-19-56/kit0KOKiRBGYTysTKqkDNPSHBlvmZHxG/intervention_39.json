For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord server. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's friends have had the Discord for two years. The girlfriend has asked to join for two months, but he said no. She feels left out and thinks he's hiding something. The author's reasons: the group is gaming and casual banter, not her friends, she doesn't play games, the humor is inside jokes, and he doesn't want her to see their private, sarcastic conversations. He also compares it to her wanting him to read her group chats, but she says it's different because Discord is public even though it's private.\n\nHe's concerned about privacy and that her joining might ruin the chat dynamics. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks he's not being open. The author can't prove he's not talking about her negatively unless he lets her join, which he's reluctant to do because of privacy and group cohesion.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Trust and communication are key. The girlfriend wants to be included and feels her concern is valid. The author is protecting his privacy and the group's chemistry. But in a relationship, partners often share their social circles. However, there's a balance between privacy and inclusion. The author's reasoning has merit because the group is private and specific. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe a separate channel for her to join, or a different group where she can interact. The author might be in the wrong if he's not making an effort to include her in a way that respects his privacy. But if he can't do that without compromising his comfort, maybe not. The comparison to her group chat is a good point. If he's not allowed to be in hers, why is she in his? But she says texting is more personal. Maybe she's right, but that's a weak argument. The author's stance is about privacy, but relationships require some level of openness.\n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because while privacy is important, the girlfriend's desire for inclusion and transparency is also valid. The author isn't making an effort to find a compromise, which could lead to ongoing issues. But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, B might be correct because the group is private and specific. Hmm. The key is whether the author's refusal is a breach of trust. If he's not doing anything wrong, why not let her join? But if the group is a closed, specific space, maybe it's reasonable. The author's explanation that she wouldn't fit in is a common groupdynamic issue. So maybe B is correct. But the girlfriend's feeling of being excluded is a red flag. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some views, a partner should be allowed to join if the group is open. But if it's a private, specific group, maybe not. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not hiding something harmful, but the comparison to her group chat is a good point. However, if the group is truly private and not public, the analogy doesn't hold. The girlfriend's insecurity might be the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his privacy and the group's dynamics, even if it causes some tension. So answer B.\n"
