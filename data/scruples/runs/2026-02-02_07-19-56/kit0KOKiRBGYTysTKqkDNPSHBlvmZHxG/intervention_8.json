For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. The author's friends have a private chat that's been around for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months because she's interested in what goes on. He says no, and she gets upset, feeling excluded.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the chat is just gaming and banter, which she's not into. He's worried she wouldn't fit in and that her presence might ruin the dynamic. He also mentions privacy concerns because their conversations are sarcastic and not serious. He tried comparing it to her wanting him in her group chat, but she disagrees, saying Discord is public, which it isn't in this case. Now she thinks he's hiding something, even though he hasn't shared anything about her. He feels like it's an invasion of privacy, but she's pushing for transparency.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to know my take. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's request is about inclusion and communication in a relationship. She wants to be part of his social circle, which is a common desire. The author is protecting his personal space and privacy, which is also valid. But maybe he's being too rigid. Relationships often require compromise. If the girlfriend is part of his life, sharing some aspects of his social life could be seen as a way to integrate her. However, the author has legitimate reasons: the chat is for a specific group with shared interests, and adding someone not part of that circle could disrupt it. Also, privacy is a big issue here\u2014friends might discuss things they wouldn't want a partner to see, even if it's not personal.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend's feeling of being excluded is also a relationship concern. The author's refusal is leading to mistrust because she thinks he's hiding something. Maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her to join without full access to everything. Or maybe he could have explained more thoroughly why the chat is a closed group. However, he did explain, and she didn't accept the comparison to her group chat. He also mentions that the chat is private, so her argument about it being public is incorrect. That might have contributed to her misunderstanding.\n\nAnother angle: relationships involve mutual respect. The author respects his privacy, but the girlfriend expects openness. The key is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since the chat is private and not public, allowing her to join might not be necessary for the relationship's health. His concerns about the chat's dynamic are valid. However, the fact that she's his girlfriend might imply that she should have some access to his social circles unless there's a good reason not to. But if the chat is a specific group with its own culture, it's plausible that inviting her isn't appropriate. Maybe he's in the right because he's maintaining boundaries, but maybe he's in the wrong because he's refusing to make an effort to include her in his life.\n\nWait, the girlfriend's argument is that couples should address problems, so she thinks he should adjust. But the author argues that it's an invasion of privacy. It's a conflict between two important values: privacy vs. inclusion. Which is more important? There's no clear answer. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's justified in wanting to keep the chat private and not disrupting the group. The fact that he's not sharing anything negative about her makes the privacy angle stronger. The problem is the communication breakdown. He tried explaining, but she still doesn't get it. Maybe he's not in the wrong because he's protecting his space, but maybe he could have found a way to include her without compromising the chat's privacy. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether refusing to let her join is a breach of trust or a reasonable boundary. Since the chat is private and the author isn't sharing anything harmful, he's probably not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
