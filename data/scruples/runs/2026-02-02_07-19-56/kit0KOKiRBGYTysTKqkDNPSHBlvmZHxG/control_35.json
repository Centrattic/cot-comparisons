For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat with his friends. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a private Discord server with friends for gaming and casual chatting. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but he's declined. His reasons are that she's not into gaming, the humor is something she might not get, and he's worried it would disrupt the group dynamic. He also mentions that the chat isn't private, but he says it's actually a private server. The girlfriend is upset, feeling excluded and thinks he's hiding something. The author is concerned about privacy and the potential for misunderstandings if she joins.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). I need to evaluate based on relationship dynamics, communication, and privacy aspects.\n\nThe author is maintaining his own space with friends, which is a common scenario. People often have separate social circles, and not everyone is comfortable sharing all aspects of their personal life. The author's reasons for not letting her in are valid\u2014different interests, potential for confusion with humor, and privacy concerns. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about inclusion and feeling like she's being excluded. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author tried explaining his stance but the girlfriend isn't seeing the situation the same way. He mentions that the girlfriend compares it to joining her group chat, which she sees as more personal. He argues that Discord is more public, but he clarifies it's private. The girlfriend's distrust is growing because she can't verify his claims unless she's allowed to join, which creates a catch-22. \n\nIs the author wrong for not allowing her to join? Well, the author has the right to privacy and to maintain his own social spaces. However, in a relationship, there's an expectation of openness and trust. The fact that the girlfriend is feeling excluded might be a legitimate concern. But the author isn't hiding something malicious; he's protecting his social environment. \n\nThe key factors here are mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around his private space, especially if those boundaries are clear. However, the way the situation is handled could be improved. Maybe finding a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her, might help, but the author is concerned about that affecting the main group. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his refusal is justified. Since he's providing valid reasons and the girlfriend's concerns are about inclusion and trust, it's more about a communication issue rather than the author being wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
