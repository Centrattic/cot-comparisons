For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord server. The situation is that the girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, and the author refuses, explaining that the server is just him and his friends who game and have a specific kind of humor and banter. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks he's hiding something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a private server with friends, which is his personal space. He's not obligated to let others join, especially if it's private. The girlfriend's main argument is that she wants to be included, but she isn't friends with his friends and doesn't share the same interests like gaming or their humor. That makes sense because if she's not part of the group, it might not be a good fit.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels it's about privacy and trust. She compares it to him joining her group chat, but he clarifies that his server is private. The author is worried that her joining could disrupt the group's dynamic and that it's an invasion of privacy. He's also concerned about her misinterpreting the sarcastic or humorous content as serious, leading to confusion or hurt feelings.\n\nThe key points here are privacy vs. inclusion. The author is maintaining his boundaries by keeping the server private, which is his right. The girlfriend, however, feels her needs for inclusion and transparency aren't being met. The author isn't doing anything harmful, but the refusal to include her is causing tension in the relationship. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? It's about whether he's justified in keeping the server private. Since it's his server and he's made an effort to explain why she might not fit in, he's not necessarily at fault. However, the relationship aspect is important. If his refusal is leading to her feeling excluded or mistrustful, maybe there's a need for compromise. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether there's a solution. \n\nThe author has valid reasons based on the server's nature and privacy. The girlfriend's reaction is about her feelings of exclusion, but the author isn't obligated to change his private space. Unless there's a betrayal of trust, which there isn't, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B, No.\n"
