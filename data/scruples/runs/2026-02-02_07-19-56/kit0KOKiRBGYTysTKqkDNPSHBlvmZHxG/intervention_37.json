For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a private Discord group with friends for almost two years. The girlfriend has been asking for two months to join because she's interested. He says no, and she gets upset. The author's reasoning is that the chat is just gaming and banter with friends she doesn't know, and he doesn't want her to see their sarcastic, maybe not serious conversations. He also mentions that she might feel confused and that it could ruin the chat. He tried to explain it's like her joining his text messages, but she doesn't see it that way. Now she thinks he's hiding something or talking about her behind her back.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: privacy and protecting the dynamic of his friends' group. His friends aren't her friends, the content is specific to their group, and he's concerned about how it might be perceived. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded and not trusted. She might see the chat as part of his life that she should be included in, especially if she's interested. The author isn't allowing her to see what he's doing with friends, which could lead to suspicion, even if he's innocent.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could create a separate channel for her or have occasional check-ins without full access. But the author is adamant that including her would ruin the chat. His friends might not be comfortable with her presence, leading to discomfort. However, the girlfriend might feel that transparency is part of a healthy relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author isn't being completely closed off\u2014maybe he could explain why the chat is private and how it's different from personal texts. But he's also not wrong to want his privacy. The problem seems to be a lack of mutual understanding. The author isn't hiding something harmful, but the girlfriend's need for inclusion isn't being met. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not necessarily in the wrong if the chat is private and he's not hiding malicious things. But he could be more empathetic to her feelings. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author is in the wrong. If B, not in the wrong. \n\nI think the key points are: he's protecting his privacy and the dynamic of his group, but isn't allowing her to feel included. However, he's not hiding something harmful. So maybe he's not in the wrong (B), but there's room for better communication. The girlfriend might need to respect his boundaries, but he could explain more. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I lean towards B.\n"
