For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting to join a private Discord chat, and the author refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's friends have been in a Discord for two years. The girlfriend has asked to join for two months, and the author says no. The reasons given are that the friends aren't her friends, she's not into gaming, and the humor is a bit inside or sarcastic. The author is worried she might get confused or that it could ruin the group dynamic.\n\nThe girlfriend feels left out and thinks the author is hiding something. She compares it to joining her group chat, but the author argues that Discord is private. The author is worried about privacy and the group's dynamics. The girlfriend can't see why it's an issue and thinks the author should adjust for her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships often involve compromise. The author has valid privacy concerns. The group is a private, established one. Letting someone in who isn't part of the original group could change the vibe. However, the girlfriend feels excluded, which is also a valid feeling. The author might not be in the wrong because they have a right to privacy. But maybe there's a middle ground, like creating a separate channel or having regular check-ins with the girlfriend. \n\nThe key points here are privacy vs. inclusion. The author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful; they're maintaining their social space. The girlfriend's request is about wanting to feel included, which is understandable. But the author isn't obligated to let her join if it's a private group. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author has a right to privacy and the group's dynamics. However, there's a communication issue because the author could explain the reasons better. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong, not about communication. So, B seems correct.\n"
