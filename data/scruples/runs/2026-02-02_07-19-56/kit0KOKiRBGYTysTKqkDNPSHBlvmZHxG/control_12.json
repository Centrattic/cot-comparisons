For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see.\n\nThe situation is that the author's girlfriend wants to join their Discord chat, which is a private group of friends they've had for two years. The author says no because the chat is for gaming and banter that the girlfriend isn't into, and they don't want her to feel confused or for the group dynamic to change. The girlfriend is upset, feeling like he's hiding something, even though he hasn't actually said anything bad about her.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they believe the girlfriend wouldn't fit in because of different interests and humor. They also don't want to include her because they think it might ruin the chat. The girlfriend feels excluded and the author is worried about privacy.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author has privacy concerns and valid reasons about the chat's nature. On the other hand, the girlfriend wants to be included and feels her request is reasonable. The author isn't hiding something per se, but they are keeping their private group separate. The girlfriend might feel that since they are in a relationship, transparency is important. But the author isn't doing anything harmful, just maintaining a private space. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't keeping secrets but is protective of their space. The girlfriend might need to respect that boundary unless there's a good reason to override it. The author isn't violating any trust, just setting a boundary. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
