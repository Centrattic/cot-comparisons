For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting to join the author's private Discord server. The author refuses, explaining that the server is for gaming friends, with inside jokes and banter that she wouldn't fit into, and that he doesn't want her seeing their private conversations. The girlfriend feels it's an invasion of privacy not to include her, and the author is worried about her misunderstanding the interactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about privacy and maintaining the dynamics of their existing group. They feel the server is a private space for specific friends, and adding someone who doesn't fit in could disrupt that. The girlfriend's perspective is about feeling excluded and wanting to be part of her partner's life, seeing the refusal as a lack of openness.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the server is private, so he has the right to control who joins. However, in a relationship, communication and transparency are important. The author is not sharing a personal space, but the girlfriend might see it as a part of the author's social life that she should be included in. The key here is whether the refusal is reasonable. Since the server is for a specific group with different interests, maybe it's not unreasonable. But the girlfriend's feelings of being excluded are valid too. \n\nThe author could be in the right because it's his server to manage, but maybe he's not considering her feelings enough. However, the girlfriend's analogy about joining her friends' group chat isn't the same because that's her own social circle. The author's server is his own, so he can set boundaries. The real issue is communication. The author tried explaining, but she still feels it's an invasion of privacy. The author might not be wrong, but there's a need for compromise. Maybe creating a separate space for her or having a more open conversation about why the existing one isn't suitable. \n\nIn many AITA cases, the answer hinges on respecting boundaries. The author's privacy is valid, but so is the girlfriend's desire for inclusion. However, since the server is private and not public, the author isn't obligated to include her. The problem is the conflict in expectations. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication could be improved. The main point is whether the refusal is justified. Since the server is private and the dynamics don't fit, the author isn't wrong.\n"
