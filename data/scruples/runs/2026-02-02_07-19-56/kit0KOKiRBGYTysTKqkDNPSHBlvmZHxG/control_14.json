For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting the girlfriend join a private Discord server that he's been part of for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but the author says no because the server is just gaming friends, has humor she wouldn't get, and he doesn't want her to see their banter. She's upset, thinking he's hiding something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about privacy and the nature of the group. His friends aren't her friends, so she might not fit in. The server is private, so he's trying to maintain that space. He's worried that her presence might kill the group dynamic. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded and that he's not being open. She compares it to him joining her group chat, but he argues it's different because the Discord is private.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because privacy in relationships is important. However, there's a need for communication. The author is explaining his reasons, which is good. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to let her join if it's a private space. The key points are consent and the nature of private groups. The author isn't hiding something malicious; he's protecting his friends' space. However, there's a need for mutual understanding. The girlfriend's insistence might be overstepping, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for maintaining boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
