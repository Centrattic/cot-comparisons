For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person's girlfriend wants to join their private Discord chat, which they've had with friends for two years. The author is against it, and the girlfriend is upset, feeling like they're not including her or being open.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that the Discord chat is a private group of friends with inside jokes, gaming, and sarcasm that the girlfriend might not fit into. They're worried it could ruin the dynamic and that it's an invasion of privacy. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels left out and thinks the author is hiding something, even though the author says they aren't.\n\nNow, the key points here are privacy, inclusion in a relationship, and communication. The author is concerned about privacy and the group's dynamics. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that being excluded from a significant part of the author's life is a relationship issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require communication and compromise. The girlfriend is expressing a need to be included, which is a valid feeling. The author is also valid in their concern about privacy. But maybe there's a middle ground. For example, the author could explain why the chat is private and perhaps find other ways to include her in other aspects of their social life. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her join. \n\nThe author hasn't done anything harmful, but they might not be addressing the underlying issue of the girlfriend feeling excluded. However, there's no obligation to share every part of one's life with a partner. The girlfriend's analogy to text messages might not hold because Discord chats can be more communal. The author is also clear that the chat is private, so it's not public. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author's refusal is a reasonable boundary. Since the author is being upfront and the chat is private, they might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend needs to respect their privacy, but the author could also try to reassure her. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they're protecting their privacy and the group's dynamic, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe some would argue that in a relationship, you should be open. However, unless there's a breach of trust, the author isn't doing anything wrong. So probably B.\n"
