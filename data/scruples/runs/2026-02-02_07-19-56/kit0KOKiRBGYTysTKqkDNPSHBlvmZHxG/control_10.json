For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord server. Their friends have been gaming and having casual chats for two years. The girlfriend has asked to join for the past two months, but the author said no because the group isn't her friends, she doesn't play games, and the humor is specific to them. The author is worried that including her might ruin the dynamic.\n\nThe girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something. The author is concerned about privacy and the nature of the group. The girlfriend compares it to reading her texts, but the author argues it's public. The author doesn't want to let her in because it could lead to confusion and might kill the chat.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are privacy versus inclusion. The author has a right to privacy in a private group. If the group is meant for close friends with shared interests, it's reasonable to not want to include outsiders. The girlfriend's feelings of being excluded are valid, but the author has legitimate reasons for maintaining the group's exclusivity. The author should communicate this clearly. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like suggesting a separate group for the girlfriend to be included in, or allowing her to join but setting boundaries. But the author's stance is that including her would ruin the chat. If that's their honest belief, then it's their choice. The girlfriend's analogy to texting is flawed because Discord is private, but she might not understand the dynamics. The author isn't hiding anything; they just have a private space. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They have valid reasons for not wanting to include her. However, they should ensure they're not being overly secretive without cause. Since the author hasn't done anything wrong and the girlfriend's request is about inclusion in a private space, the answer is B.\n"
