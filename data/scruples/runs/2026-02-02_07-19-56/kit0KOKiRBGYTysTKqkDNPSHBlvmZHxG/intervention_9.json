For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord server. The author's friends have had this private chat for two years, and the girlfriend has been asking to join for two months. The author is concerned that she won't fit in because she's not into gaming, doesn't understand the humor, and they don't want her to see their sarcastic banter. The girlfriend feels it's about privacy and not including her, while the author thinks it's about keeping the chat's vibe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is about privacy and the nature of the group. They mention it's a private server, not public, and they don't want outsiders to see their casual, maybe even inappropriate jokes. That makes sense because some friends have inside jokes or talk about topics that aren't suitable for others. If the girlfriend joins and misunderstands or feels uncomfortable, it could create tension. Also, the author doesn't want to have to prove their innocence by sharing chat logs, which is a valid privacy concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels left out and not included. She might feel that if the relationship is serious, the author should make an effort to integrate her into his social circles. The author's analogy about wanting to join her group chat might not hold because, as the author points out, the Discord is private, whereas texting is more personal. But the girlfriend doesn't see that distinction. It's possible she's using this as a way to test the author's openness and commitment. The fact that she's accusing him of talking about her when he hasn't might be a sign of trust issues on her part.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships often require compromise. The author isn't being inconsiderate by explaining his reasons; he's stating his boundaries. However, not even considering the possibility of creating a separate space for her, like a different channel, might be a point against him. But the author didn't mention that as an option. If the girlfriend really wants to be part of the group, maybe the author could adjust the server structure to allow her to participate without feeling like it's an intrusion. But the author is concerned that her presence would ruin the dynamic. \n\nTrust and communication are key here. The author is trying to communicate his stance, but the girlfriend isn't accepting it. The author isn't hiding anything; he's just protecting his private space. The girlfriend's insistence could be a sign of insecurity or a need for validation. The author isn't doing anything unethical or wrong by not letting her join. It's a private group, and the author has the right to set boundaries. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too, and the author might need to find a middle ground. But in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing by his privacy and the nature of the group. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
