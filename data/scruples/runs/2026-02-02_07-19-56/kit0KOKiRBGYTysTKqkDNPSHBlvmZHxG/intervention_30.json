For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the author's girlfriend wants to join their private Discord chat that's been around for two years. The author says no because the chat is for gaming friends with a certain kind of humor that she might not fit into. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's friends' privacy and the girlfriend's desire for inclusion. The author is concerned that including her might ruin the dynamic of the group, which is a valid point if the chat is a specific environment. But on the other hand, the girlfriend is asking to be part of the author's social circle, which is a reasonable request in a relationship.\n\nThe author compares it to the girlfriend joining his group chat, but the girlfriend argues that Discord is more public. However, the author clarifies it's private. The girlfriend's main issue is feeling left out and not trusted. The author's refusal might be seen as not making an effort to include her, which could be a relationship problem. \n\nBut the author also mentions that the content might be confusing or inappropriate for her. There's a balance between privacy and inclusion. If the author isn't sharing personal information, maybe he's justified in keeping the chat private. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that she wants to be included and trusted. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe the author could find a compromise, like a separate channel for her. But the author thinks that would ruin the chat. It's a tough call. Some might say the author is being unreasonable by not trying to include her, while others might support his right to privacy. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since he's setting boundaries for his private space. However, there's room for discussion about how to address her feelings without compromising the group's dynamic.\n"
