For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord chat. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a private Discord server with friends that's been around for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but the author says no. The reasons given are that the chat is for gaming, has a specific humor, and the author doesn't want outsiders to see the banter. The girlfriend feels it's a privacy issue, like the author is hiding something, even though he's not. She compares it to him wanting to join her group chat, but he argues the Discord is private.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author has a private space with friends, and they have specific dynamics. They're worried about the girlfriend not fitting in and potentially causing issues. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded and wants to be part of his social circle. She's concerned about his honesty and maybe even feels he's keeping secrets.\n\nIs it about privacy vs. inclusion? The author might not be in the wrong if he explains the reasons clearly. He mentions the chat isn't for her friends, she doesn't game, and the humor is inside jokes. Maybe she feels left out, but that doesn't mean he's wrong to set boundaries. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her to participate in certain parts. But the author believes including her would ruin the chat. \n\nThe girlfriend's comparison to a group chat isn't perfect. Texting is more personal and private, while Discord is supposed to be public but private in their case. The author is frustrated because she's accusing him of hiding things, which he isn't. He can't prove innocence unless she joins, which he doesn't want to do. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried explaining the reasons, but she's not satisfied. Maybe he's not wrong for not wanting to let her in if he's already made his case. However, if the girlfriend's concern is about being included, maybe the author could find another way to involve her without compromising the original group's dynamics. But the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nThe author's stance is about protecting the privacy and integrity of his friend group. The girlfriend's stance is about being included and feeling trusted. Both have valid points. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for maintaining boundaries, especially if the group isn't meant for outsiders. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance where the author could be more accommodating. However, given the information, the author's reasons are explained, and the girlfriend isn't respecting those boundaries. So, the answer is B.\n"
