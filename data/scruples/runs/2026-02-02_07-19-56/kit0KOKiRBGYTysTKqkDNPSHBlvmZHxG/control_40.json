For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. \n\nFirst, the author's friends have been in a private Discord for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but he's been refusing. His reasons are that the group isn't her friends, she's not into gaming, the humor might be confusing, and he doesn't want her to see their private, sarcastic banter. He also fears it might ruin the chat. \n\nHe tried to compare it to her not wanting him in her group chat, but she thinks it's different because Discord is more public. She now feels he's hiding something, even though he denies sharing anything about her.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to protect his privacy and the dynamic of his existing group. He's not obligated to share his private space with others, especially if they might not fit in. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded and like there's a lack of trust. In relationships, communication and mutual understanding are key. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't about hiding something but maintaining privacy. However, if the girlfriend feels it's an issue of trust, maybe there's a breakdown in communication. But the author isn't doing anything harmful; he's just keeping a private space private. He's honest about the reasons. The girlfriend might need to respect his boundaries. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. His privacy and comfort with his friends are valid. The answer is B.\n"
