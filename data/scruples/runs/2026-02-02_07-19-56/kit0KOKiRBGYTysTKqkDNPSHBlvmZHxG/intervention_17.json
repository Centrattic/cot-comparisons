For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together for a while. The girlfriend has been trying to join the author's private Discord group for two months but has been refused. She's upset because she feels excluded. The author's reasoning is that the chat is for gaming friends with specific humor and banter she might not understand. He also mentions that the chat is private and he doesn't want her to think he's hiding things or saying negative things about her. The girlfriend feels it's an invasion of privacy, but the author thinks it's not the same as text messages. He can't prove his innocence without letting her join, which he's reluctant to do.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's the case. Let's consider the key points.\n\nThe author's friends are a close-knit group with specific interests. The girlfriend isn't into gaming and might not fit in. The author is concerned about privacy, as the group's interactions are casual and sarcastic. He's worried about her misunderstanding things. The girlfriend is frustrated because she wants to be included and feels her partner isn't being open. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not obligated to share all his private spaces with his partner. Privacy is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion are also valid. The author could have explained his reasons better or found a middle ground. Maybe creating a separate, more inclusive channel or having a private chat with her about the dynamics of the group. \n\nBut the author is standing by his decision, thinking it's best for the group's dynamic. The girlfriend feels it's a refusal to be open, but he isn't sharing something inherently harmful. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. Since the group is private and not public, and the author has a legitimate concern about how the girlfriend might perceive the interactions, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, not considering the girlfriend's perspective could be an issue. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for not letting her join, but he could be at fault for not addressing her concerns adequately or finding a compromise. However, the answer hinges on whether privacy rights outweigh the partner's need for inclusion. Since the author has a valid point about privacy and the group's nature, and the girlfriend isn't part of the group's original dynamic, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). But some might argue that couples should make efforts for inclusion. However, the author isn't forcing his friends to include her, and his reasons are based on practical concerns rather than personal dislike. So leaning towards B.\n"
