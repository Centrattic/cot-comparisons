For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about whether the author should let their girlfriend join their private Discord chat.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is that the Discord chat is a private group of friends who game and have inside jokes. They don't want to include the girlfriend because she's not into gaming, doesn't know the friends, and the humor might confuse her. They also mention the chat is private, and they fear it might ruin the group dynamic if she joins. They compare it to her wanting access to their texts, but she disagrees.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded and wants to be part of the author's life. She sees it as a privacy issue similar to texts, but the author argues it's different because the chat is public, even though it's private. The author is worried that letting her in would invade their privacy and potentially create misunderstandings.\n\nI need to assess if the author's refusal is reasonable. The key points here are privacy, mutual respect, and communication. The author has a right to privacy regarding their private conversations with friends. The girlfriend's desire for inclusion is valid, but the author's concern about the group's dynamics and privacy is also legitimate. The author isn't hiding something malicious; they're protecting their private space. However, the girlfriend feels untrusted, which could affect their relationship.\n\nThe author's analogy about joining the girlfriend's group chat isn't quite the same because private messages versus a group chat with friends. The author's refusal isn't about hiding something but about maintaining a private space. The author isn't in the wrong if they've communicated their reasons clearly. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's need for reassurance rather than the author's fault. So, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
