For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord chat. He explains that the chat is with friends who game and have their own humor, and he's worried she wouldn't fit in and it might ruin the dynamic. The girlfriend feels like he's hiding something and it's causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about privacy and maintaining the existing group dynamics. He's concerned that adding someone who isn't part of their circle might lead to confusion or discomfort for her and disrupt the chat. That makes sense because private groups often have an established vibe and inside jokes. He also mentions that his girlfriend isn't into gaming or their humor, so maybe she wouldn't contribute much.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is about feeling excluded and wanting to be included in his life. She's asking to be part of his social circle, which is a common desire in relationships. She might feel that if he's not open to sharing his space with her, he's being secretive. The comparison she made between joining a group chat versus reading texts is a bit different, but she's drawing a line about privacy boundaries. However, the author points out that the Discord is private, so maybe her argument isn't entirely accurate.\n\nThe key here is communication and mutual respect. The author tried to explain why she wouldn't fit in and why he's against it, but the girlfriend isn't satisfied. The author is worried about privacy invasion, which is a valid concern. If he's sharing personal or inside information, allowing an outsider could indeed cause issues. However, the girlfriend's need to feel included is also important in a relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's making a reasonable argument based on privacy and the nature of the group. But relationships require some level of openness and compromise. If the girlfriend is constantly asking and the author is refusing without finding a middle ground, that could be a problem. But the author does explain his reasons, so it's not as if he's being secretive without cause. The girlfriend's insistence might be overstepping if she can't respect the established boundaries of the group.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that allowing her to join would require him to let her read all past and future messages, which he's uncomfortable with. That's a privacy concern. The girlfriend's demand to know everything might be unrealistic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's protecting his privacy and the integrity of his friend group. However, maybe there's a way to address the girlfriend's need for inclusion without compromising the Discord chat. Like, creating a separate, more inclusive space where she can participate without affecting the main group. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's articulated his reasons and the situation is about privacy versus inclusion, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that in a relationship, sharing more of your life is expected. It's a tough call, but the author's stance seems reasonable.\n"
