For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord server. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been asking to join for two months. The author's main reasons are that the server is for gaming friends, she's not into games, the humor and banter might be confusing, and they don't want her to feel out of place. Also, there's a privacy concern because they have inside jokes or might say sarcastic things that she might misinterpret. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something, even though he hasn't actually done anything. She compares it to him joining her group chat, but he argues that his Discord is private.\n\nThe author is worried that inviting her could ruin the group dynamics. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels like he's not being open and that there's a lack of trust. The key points here are privacy vs. inclusion. The author has valid privacy concerns about a private chat that's meant for a specific group. The girlfriend is seeking inclusion and transparency in the relationship.\n\nBut relationships often require balancing personal space with partner's needs. The author isn't doing anything harmful, like hiding something actually private, but the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion are real. The conflict arises from different expectations. However, the author has legitimate reasons for not wanting to include her in a space that's not hers. The girlfriend's comparison to reading text messages might not be accurate because Discord is a private server, not public. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's maintaining boundaries around his social group, which is reasonable. The problem might be communication\u2014maybe they need to find a middle ground, but the author isn't violating any rules or being malicious here.\n"
