For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord chat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that the Discord is a private group of friends who game and have a specific kind of humor. He thinks his girlfriend wouldn't fit in because she's not into gaming or their banter. He's worried she might misinterpret their jokes and that her presence could ruin the group dynamic. Also, he feels it's an invasion of privacy since the chat is private, even though she draws a comparison to text messages.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author isn't being open. She might feel that by not allowing her to join, he's hiding something, even if he's innocent. Her perspective is that in a relationship, both partners should address issues that cause problems, and this is her way of seeking inclusion and transparency.\n\nNow, considering privacy versus inclusion. The author has the right to privacy in his private chat, especially if it's a space for close friends. However, relationships also require communication and compromise. The girlfriend's request isn't unreasonable if she's trying to understand his social circle better. The author could find a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her or introducing her to the group in a way that doesn't compromise the existing dynamics. \n\nBut the author's main point is that the group isn't hers to join, and he's concerned about the group's comfort. The girlfriend might need to respect that boundary, but she's also valid in feeling excluded. The key issue here is whether refusing to let her join is a privacy issue or an exclusionary action. The author might not be wrong if the chat is indeed a private, specific group, but maybe he's not handling the situation well by not finding a compromise. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nSince he's maintaining a boundary for privacy and group dynamics, and she's pushing for inclusion, it's a conflict between two valid perspectives. But the author isn't violating any clear wrong here. He's explaining his reasons, which are about privacy and group suitability. The girlfriend's frustration is valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer is B (No).\n"
