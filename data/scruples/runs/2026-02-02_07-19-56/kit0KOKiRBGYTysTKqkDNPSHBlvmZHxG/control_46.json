For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together for two months. The girlfriend wants to join a private Discord group the author has had with friends for two years. The author refuses because he thinks she wouldn't fit in\u2014she doesn't game, doesn't get their humor, and he's worried it might ruin the group. The girlfriend feels he's being closed off and not trusting her, thinking he might be saying negative things about her behind her back.\n\nThe author's main points are about privacy and the nature of the group. The friends are close, and the chat is a space where they're sarcastic and not always serious. He's concerned adding an outsider, even his girlfriend, could disrupt the dynamic. He also mentions that she's using the \"couples should be open with each other\" argument, but he sees it as a private space, similar to his text messages, which she wouldn't want him to read.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is about inclusion and feeling like he's hiding something. She doesn't see the difference between texting (more personal) and Discord (which she thinks is public, even though it's private). She feels excluded and wants to be part of his world.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author has valid privacy concerns; it's his private group, and he's worried about how it functions. However, in a relationship, there's an expectation of transparency and inclusion. The girlfriend's concern isn't just about joining the Discord but feeling left out of his social circle. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Possibly not. He has the right to privacy and to maintain his social group as he sees fit. But at the same time, he could be seen as not making an effort to integrate her into his life. Maybe there's a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her if she wants to participate. However, the author believes that including her would ruin the group, which is a personal judgment. \n\nThe girlfriend's analogy about texting isn't perfect, but her need to feel included is valid. The author's refusal might be seen as not respecting her feelings enough. However, he's also not violating any moral obligation by not including her if he genuinely feels it's not appropriate. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's privacy and group dynamics are more important than the girlfriend's need for inclusion. Since both have valid points, but the author is maintaining his personal space and the group isn't a shared space, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But there's room for compromise. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the answer might be B (No) because he's justified in protecting his privacy and the group's dynamic.\n"
