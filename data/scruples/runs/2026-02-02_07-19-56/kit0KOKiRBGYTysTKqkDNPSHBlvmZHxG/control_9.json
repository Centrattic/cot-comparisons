For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord server. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guy has a private Discord chat with his friends that's been around for two years. His girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but he keeps refusing. She's getting annoyed because she feels excluded. He explains that the chat is for gaming, banter, and sarcasm, and she might not fit in. He's worried she'd be confused or that her presence would ruin the dynamic. \n\nHe tried comparing it to her wanting to join his texts, but she says it's different because Discord is public, even though it's private. Now she thinks he's hiding things or talking about her behind her back. He can't prove his innocence without letting her in, which he's reluctant to do because he values his privacy. \n\nSo, the core issues here are privacy, trust, and communication. The user is asking if he's wrong for not letting her join. \n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, there's a balance between maintaining personal boundaries and being considerate of a partner's feelings. The guy has legitimate concerns about privacy and the group's dynamic. However, the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion and insecurity are also valid. \n\nIn relationships, trust is key. If he's not doing anything wrong, why is he hesitant to let her see? On the other hand, if the group's content is inappropriate or could be misinterpreted, he might have a point. \n\nBut the girlfriend's analogy about joining his texts isn't perfect. Texts are more personal, while Discord is semi-public but still private. The guy's comparison might not hold water, which could be why she's frustrated. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's been asking for two months suggests she's serious about wanting to be included. His refusal might be seen as not making an effort to include her, which could hurt her feelings. However, he's explaining his reasons, so it's not entirely his fault. \n\nI think the key here is whether he's being reasonable in his refusal. If the content is harmless and the issue is just about her not fitting in, maybe he's being a bit selfish. But if the group talks about things that could be misinterpreted or are not partner-friendly, his stance is justified. \n\nGiven the information, the guy's main argument is about privacy and the group's dynamic. The girlfriend feels excluded and untrusted. The answer depends on whether the refusal is about legitimate privacy concerns or just avoiding inclusion. Since he hasn't done anything wrong but isn't being open, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The situation is a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he has valid reasons. However, there's room for both sides. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
