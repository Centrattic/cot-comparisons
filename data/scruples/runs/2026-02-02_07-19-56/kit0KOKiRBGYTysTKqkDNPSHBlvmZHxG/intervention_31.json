For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" scenario) is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord server.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main points are that the Discord is a private, game-oriented chat with friends who have a specific humor and banter. He doesn't think she'd fit in because she's not into gaming or their style of communication. He's also worried that including her might ruin the dynamic of the group. He tried explaining that it's like her reading his group texts, but she disagrees, saying Discord is more public. She now feels he's hiding things, even though he's not. He's torn because he wants to maintain his privacy but also address her concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded. She asked to join because she's interested in what happens in the chat, and she's upset that her partner isn't being open. She sees it as a communication issue in the relationship, where not including her might be a problem. Her argument is that couples should listen to each other's concerns and make adjustments if something's causing issues.\n\nSo the core question is about balancing privacy and relationship expectations. The author is prioritizing his privacy and the group's dynamic, while the girlfriend is prioritizing inclusion and transparency. \n\nIs the author wrong for not joining her to the server? Well, he has legitimate reasons: the server is private and specific, and adding her might disrupt the group. He's also not doing anything harmful (like sharing her personal info). But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too; she wants to feel included in his social circles. \n\nBut does refusing to include her in a space he's comfortable with make him in the wrong? It might depend on how open the relationship is. If the girlfriend feels neglected or like there's a lack of transparency, that's a relational issue. However, the author isn't hiding anything harmful, just keeping an existing private group. Maybe the real issue is communication\u2014both sides need to understand each other's perspectives. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because he's not violating any rules or being dishonest. But maybe he could find a middle ground, like creating a separate server for the two of them or inviting her to a different part of the Discord. However, the current setup isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's frustration is about inclusion, which is a valid concern in a relationship, but the author's privacy is also a valid point. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is a privacy issue or a relational one. Since the server is private and not shared with others outside their group, the author's stance is defensible. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling excluded, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But there's room for both sides to compromise.\n"
