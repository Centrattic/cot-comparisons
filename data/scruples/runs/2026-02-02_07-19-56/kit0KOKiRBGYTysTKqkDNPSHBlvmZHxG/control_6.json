For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord chat. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been in a private Discord group with friends for two years. The girlfriend has asked to join for two months, and the author keeps refusing. The girlfriend is upset, feeling that the author isn't being open and is hiding something. The author's reasons are that the group is for gaming, sarcasm, and humor the girlfriend wouldn't get, and that adding her would ruin the dynamic. They also tried to compare it to her being in their personal messages but said Discord is public, even though it's private. The girlfriend is now accusing the author of sharing personal info about her, which he hasn't.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about privacy versus inclusion in a relationship. The author is concerned about keeping their private space private, especially with a group that has a specific culture. The girlfriend wants more openness and inclusion, feeling that the refusal is a barrier. The author's argument is that the group isn't suitable for her, but the girlfriend sees it as a lack of trust. \n\nI should consider relationship norms. In healthy relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author is setting a boundary around his friends' chat, which is a form of privacy. On the other hand, the girlfriend's request is about wanting to feel included in his life. The question is whether the refusal is unjust. \n\nThe author's reasoning includes the risk of the chat's dynamics changing, which is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend's feeling of being excluded might be important to her. The author might need to find a middle ground, like sharing some highlights or being open about what they discuss without inviting her into the private chat. \n\nBut the key point is that the author hasn't done anything wrong by refusing. The girlfriend has the right to feel included, but the author also has the right to privacy. The answer likely depends on whether the refusal is a boundary or a way to hide something. Since the author claims it's not about hiding but about the chat's nature, he's probably not in the wrong. However, the way he's handling it could be improved. But according to the options, the answer is either A or B, not a nuanced middle. Since the author is not violating any norms by keeping the chat private, the answer should be B.\n"
