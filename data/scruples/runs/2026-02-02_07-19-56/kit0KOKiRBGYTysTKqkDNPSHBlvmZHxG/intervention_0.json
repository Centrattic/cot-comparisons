For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe situation is about a girlfriend wanting to join the author's private Discord server. The author's friends have been in this group for two years. The girlfriend has asked for the last two months to be included, but the author refused. The girlfriend got upset, thinking the author isn't being open or inclusive. The author's reasoning is that the Discord is for gaming and banter with friends she's not close to, and he's concerned about privacy and potential misunderstandings. The girlfriend feels like he's hiding something, even though he hasn't actually shared anything about her.\n\nThe author is conflicted because he values his privacy and thinks his friends might not take well to her joining. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels left out and wants to be part of his social circle. The author is trying to explain that it's different from her texting friends because the Discord is private, but she doesn't see it that way. The author now feels like he has to let her in to prove his innocence, but he doesn't want to.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he's protecting his private space with friends where they communicate in a specific way that might not be suitable for an outsider. He's also concerned that her joining could disrupt the group dynamic. On the other hand, the girlfriend is seeking inclusion and might feel neglected. The argument here is that couples need to be open and address each other's concerns.\n\nThe key points are privacy vs. inclusion. The author is not sharing something he's doing (the group chat) that might cause issues, but he's also not willing to compromise. The girlfriend is seeking transparency, which is a reasonable expectation in a relationship. However, the author isn't hiding something harmful; it's just a social group. The question is whether not including a partner in a private group is a breach of trust or just a boundary issue.\n\nIn relationships, there's a balance between personal privacy and shared experiences. If the girlfriend's request is about feeling included and the group isn't doing anything inappropriate, maybe the author could consider making an exception or at least having a more open dialogue. However, if the group is indeed a private space with inside jokes and a specific dynamic, it's not necessarily wrong for the author to set that boundary. The problem might be more about communication. The author tried to explain the differences between texting and Discord, but she didn't accept it. The author might be in the wrong if his refusal is causing unnecessary hurt without a valid reason, but if the reasons are legitimate, then maybe not.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the refusal is based on valid privacy concerns or if it's a way to avoid sharing his social life. The author's reasoning seems valid, but the girlfriend's feelings are also important. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's maintaining his boundaries, but there's a nuance where maybe there's room for compromise. However, the girlfriend's insistence and the author's valid reasons might tip it to B.\n"
