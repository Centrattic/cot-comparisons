For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting to join the author's private Discord chat, which he's refusing. The author's friends are people he's known for two years, and they game together, have inside jokes, and are very sarcastic. The girlfriend is not into gaming, doesn't know the friends, and might not understand their humor. The author is concerned that adding her would ruin the chat's dynamic and that she might misinterpret their banter.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded and thinks he's hiding something. She compares it to him wanting access to her private messages, but he argues that Discord is public and not as personal. The author is worried about privacy and the potential for misunderstanding. The girlfriend wants transparency but isn't satisfied with the explanation.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy, boundaries, and relationship dynamics. The author is maintaining that the chat is a private space for a specific group of friends with certain shared interests. If the girlfriend isn't part of that group, bringing her in could indeed disrupt the existing dynamics. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel neglected or insecure if she's excluded from her partner's social circles. \n\nRelationships require communication and compromise. The author explains his reasons clearly, but the girlfriend isn't convinced. The author isn't hiding something malicious; he's just protecting the privacy of his friends' group. However, maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps creating a separate, more inclusive space where the girlfriend can participate without merging into the main chat. Alternatively, the author could introduce her to the group in a way that makes everyone comfortable. \n\nBut the author is firm in his stance that it's not appropriate. The girlfriend's comparison to text messages isn't accurate because a private Discord server isn't the same as private messages. The author's concern about privacy and the potential for misunderstandings is valid. If he's honest and the girlfriend still insists, maybe she's not respecting his boundaries. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at whether the person has valid reasons and if they're overstepping. Here, the author's reasons seem legitimate. He's not being inconsiderate; he's protecting a private space. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
