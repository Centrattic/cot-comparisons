For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author has a private Discord group chat with his friends that's been around for two years. His girlfriend has asked to join for the past two months, but he's refused. She's upset, feeling excluded, and thinks he's hiding something. The author's reasons are that the chat is for gaming and banter with people she doesn't know, and he's worried she wouldn't fit in or understand the humor. Also, he's concerned that adding her might ruin the dynamics of the chat. He compared her request to him wanting to join her group chat, but she said it's different because Discord is public. He's worried about privacy and proving his innocence, but he doesn't want to compromise the group's privacy.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if A (Yes) or B (No) is the right answer. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's maintaining a private space with close friends. He's justified his reasons: the chat is for people who game and share inside jokes, and adding an outsider could disrupt that. Privacy is a concern here. Also, he's not doing anything harmful, just keeping the group exclusive. He's trying to explain that it's not about hiding things but about the nature of the group.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she wants inclusion and feels excluded. She might see the chat as part of his life that she's not allowed into, leading to mistrust. She might feel that if he were transparent, she wouldn't have to question his actions. The comparison to her friends' group chat might be a stretch, but her feeling of being left out is real. Healthy communication in a relationship often involves transparency, and she's asking for inclusion in his social circle, which is a reasonable expectation.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries vs. inclusion. The author is setting a boundary to protect his friends' privacy and the group's dynamic. However, the girlfriend feels it's a lack of openness. The question is whether the boundary is valid or if it's causing unnecessary harm.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. He's not hiding secrets or lying; he's just not including her in a specific social group. The issue is more about differing expectations in a relationship. If the girlfriend feels that inclusion is important for trust, but the author feels the group's privacy is non-negotiable, there's a conflict. The author isn't wrong for having his own friends' group, but he might need to better explain the reasons and address her concerns.\n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to assess if his refusal is a breach of trust or if it's a reasonable boundary. Since the chat is private and he's not hiding anything, perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, maybe he could have found a middle ground, like a separate group where she could be included without disrupting the original group. But that's a \"could have\" scenario, not necessarily a right or wrong.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's maintaining a private group and isn't hiding anything. The problem is more about communication and differing expectations rather than the author being wrong.\n"
