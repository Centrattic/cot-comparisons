For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the author should let his girlfriend join his private Discord server. The girlfriend has been asking for two months, and he's refusing because he thinks she wouldn't fit in. The friends are gamers, and their chat is casual, sarcastic, and not serious. He's worried that adding her might ruin the dynamic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants to be included because she's interested. She might feel left out or that her partner isn't being open. The author is concerned about privacy and the group's vibe. He mentions that the chat isn't for her friends and that she's not into gaming or their humor. He also points out that the chat is private, but she's comparing it to text messages, which she feels are more personal.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author explained his reasons, but the girlfriend isn't convinced. He's worried that letting her in would invade his privacy and possibly harm the group's dynamic. But maybe there's a middle ground? Like creating a separate server or a private channel for her. However, the author feels that doing so might still cause issues. \n\nIs it fair for the girlfriend to demand access? It's her partner's private space, but relationships do require sharing certain aspects. However, the author has the right to privacy. The question is whether refusing to include her is a valid boundary or if it's excluding her without good reason.\n\nThe author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just protecting a space where he and his friends relax. The girlfriend's concern is about transparency, but the author isn't doing anything harmful. It's a matter of balancing privacy and inclusion. \n\nIn many cases, couples need to find a balance. If the author's reasons are genuine and he's not being secretive, maybe he's not in the wrong. On the flip side, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and he could make an effort to include her without compromising the group, that might be expected. But given the nature of the group and the author's valid concerns, maybe B is the right answer.\n"
