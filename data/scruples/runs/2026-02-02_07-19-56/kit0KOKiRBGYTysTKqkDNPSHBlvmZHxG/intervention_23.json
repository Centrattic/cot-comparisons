For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. The situation involves a private group chat with friends that's been around for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, and the author has refused, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that the chat is for gaming friends, not her, and that he doesn't want her to see their sarcastic banter. He also mentions that she's not into video games and wouldn't fit in. Privacy is a big concern here. He feels that allowing her to join would invade his privacy and potentially ruin the dynamic of the group.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded and untrusted. She's asking for inclusion, which is a valid request in a relationship. She's trying to understand his social circle and feels that his refusal is a form of hiding something. The author tried to explain the difference between a private chat and texting, but she doesn't see it the same way. This is causing her anxiety and mistrust.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are privacy vs. inclusion. In relationships, communication is crucial. The author has a valid point about privacy and the nature of the group. However, the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion are valid too. The author could have found a middle ground, like creating a separate private channel for her or introducing her to the group in a way that doesn't disrupt the existing chat. He also should clarify that he's not hiding anything, perhaps by sharing past messages or having an open conversation with his friends to set boundaries.\n\nBut the author hasn't done that. He's been firm in his refusal without trying to accommodate her needs. While he has the right to privacy, relationships require compromise. The fact that he's not willing to find a solution that respects both his privacy and her need for inclusion might tip the scales. However, it's also his right to maintain his private space. The answer here might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. But since the girlfriend's request is about inclusion and trust, and the author's refusal is causing her distress without a clear explanation or alternative, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not trying to find a compromise. So, Answer A.\n"
