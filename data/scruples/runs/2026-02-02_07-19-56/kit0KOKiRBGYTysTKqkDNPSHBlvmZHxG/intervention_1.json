For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend wants to join their private Discord server that's been around for two years. She's been asking for two months, and he's refused. She's upset because she feels excluded and thinks he's being closed off. His reasons are that the group isn't her friends, she's not into gaming, the humor is specific, and he doesn't want her to see their banter, which might confuse her or ruin the dynamic.\n\nHe argues that the Discord is private, unlike her personal messages, and that she's accusing him of hiding things or talking about her, which he denies. He feels it's an invasion of privacy. She's using the idea that couples should address issues when they arise, so he should adjust to fix this.\n\nNow, considering whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's justified in wanting to maintain the privacy and specific group dynamic. The friends aren't hers, and the content might not be suitable for an outsider. On the other hand, his refusal is causing her distress and making her feel excluded. Communication is a two-way street, but he's explained his reasoning. She's not accepting his stance and is pushing for access despite his comfort with the current setup.\n\nI think the key here is mutual respect and understanding. He's not forcing her to do anything; she's trying to impose a change on his privacy. He's given valid reasons for not letting her in, and she's not respecting his boundaries. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of relationship dynamics\u2014should he make exceptions for his partner? However, the group isn't hers to add. So, I lean towards B (he's not in the wrong) because he's protecting his privacy and the group's dynamic, and she's not respecting his boundaries.\n"
