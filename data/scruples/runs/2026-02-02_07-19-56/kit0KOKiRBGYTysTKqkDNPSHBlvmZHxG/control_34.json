For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. The key points here are the author's reasons and the girlfriend's reactions.\n\nFirst, the author explains that the Discord chat is a private group of friends who game and have banter. He's concerned that the girlfriend wouldn't fit in because she's not into gaming, doesn't understand their humor, and might get confused. Also, he doesn't want her to see their sarcastic conversations, which could be misinterpreted. He compares it to her wanting him to join her group chat, which she says is different because texts are more personal. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks he's hiding something, even though he hasn't done anything. The author feels this is an invasion of privacy and that allowing her in would ruin the dynamics of the chat.\n\nNow, considering typical relationship advice, open communication is important. The girlfriend is expressing a need to feel included, which is a valid concern. However, the author has valid privacy and boundary reasons. The question is whether the refusal is unjust. The author isn't doing anything harmful; it's about personal space. But the girlfriend's feelings of being excluded might be significant. However, the author isn't obligated to share every part of his social life. The girlfriend might need to respect his boundaries. So, it's a balance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. But according to the options, the answer is either A or B. Since the author's reasons are reasonable and he's not violating anything, the answer is B.\n"
