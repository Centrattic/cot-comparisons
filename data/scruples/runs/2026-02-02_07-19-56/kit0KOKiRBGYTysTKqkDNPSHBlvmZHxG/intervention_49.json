For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend wanting to join the author's private Discord chat, which he's not letting her into. The author's friends have been in this chat for two years, and the girlfriend has been asking to join for the past two months. She's annoyed because he's not open with her and not including her. The author's reasoning is that the chat is for gaming, with friends who aren't her friends, and they have sarcastic humor that she wouldn't get. He also thinks her joining would ruin the chat and is worried about privacy. He compared it to her reading his text messages, but she says it's different because Discord is public. Now she thinks he's hiding something or talking about her, even though he hasn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is asking to be included in the relationship, which is a natural desire. The author might feel that his friends' privacy and the dynamic of the group are important. But then again, in a relationship, communication is key. The author isn't giving her a chance to see what's going on, which she perceives as a lack of transparency. He's worried she might misinterpret the humor or that the chat's dynamic would change if she's there. But is that a valid reason to exclude her entirely?\n\nThe author's main arguments are about privacy and the nature of the group. However, relationships often require compromise. The girlfriend might feel left out, which could strain their relationship. The author could argue that it's his right to control who's in his private chat, but if it's causing her distress, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, maybe he could create a separate channel where they can both be, or have occasional check-ins with her about the chat. But he's not willing to let her into the main chat, which she sees as a rejection of her inclusion.\n\nThe author's comparison to her reading his text messages is a bit flawed. Text messages between friends are more personal and private than a group chat, even if it's private. But the girlfriend doesn't see it that way. The author might be misunderstanding her needs. Maybe she just wants to feel more connected or to understand what he's doing with his friends. Instead of giving her access to the entire chat, maybe there are other ways to communicate without compromising the group's dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, if the chat is a close-knit group of friends with inside jokes and gaming discussions, it's reasonable for the author to want to keep it as is. But the girlfriend's feelings are also valid. It's a balance between personal privacy and relationship transparency. Since the girlfriend feels it's important for her to be included, and the author isn't willing to accommodate that, it might be a point of contention. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's not sharing private information about her and is maintaining his boundaries. The key issue is whether there's a way to meet in the middle, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not letting her join.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because he has valid reasons for keeping the chat private, but it's also a communication issue. However, if the girlfriend's request is about inclusion and trust, and the author is refusing without finding a compromise, maybe he is in the wrong. But the author's reasoning seems legitimate enough. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
