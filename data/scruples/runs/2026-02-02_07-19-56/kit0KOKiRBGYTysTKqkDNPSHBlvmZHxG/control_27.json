For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join their Discord chat. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author has a private Discord server with his friends that's been around for two years. His girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but he keeps saying no. She's upset because she feels excluded and thinks he's hiding something. The author argues that the chat is just gaming and banter, she's not into video games, wouldn't fit in, and that including her might ruin the dynamic. He also mentions privacy concerns about their sarcastic humor and not wanting her to see personal stuff. He tried to compare it to her joining his group chat but she disagrees, saying Discord is public. She now thinks he's talking about her negatively.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is protecting his private space with friends, which is a valid point. Privacy and comfort in friendships are important. He's not obligated to let others into his personal group. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel neglected or untrusted. She's expressing a desire to be included and understands the difference between private messages and a public chat, but he says it's private. There's also the issue of her perception that he's hiding things, which could lead to trust issues.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could create a separate server or a different channel where the girlfriend can participate without accessing the main chat. That way, he maintains his privacy but shows willingness to include her in some capacity. However, the author might not see this as necessary. \n\nThe key points are privacy vs. inclusion. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by keeping his friends' chat private. However, his refusal without offering alternatives might cause relationship strain. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, it's about whether his actions are objectively wrong. Since privacy is a personal right, and he's not harming her directly, he's likely not in the wrong. The issue is more about communication and relationship dynamics rather than a clear right or wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
