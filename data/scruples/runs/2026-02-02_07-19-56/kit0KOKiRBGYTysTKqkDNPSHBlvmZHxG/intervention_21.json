For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. The situation involves a private group chat with friends that's been around for two years. The girlfriend has asked to join for two months, and the author keeps refusing, leading to her feeling excluded and accusing him of hiding things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author's main reasons are that the chat is for gaming and banter, which she's not into, and he's concerned about privacy and potential confusion. He also mentions that the chat is private, but she's comparing it to her text messages, which she sees as more personal. The girlfriend feels it's an issue of openness and trust, while the author sees it as a privacy issue.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship norms. In many relationships, transparency and inclusion are important. The girlfriend's request is to be included in his social circle, which he's resisting. But the author has valid privacy concerns\u2014his friends might say things that are sarcastic or not meant to be taken seriously. Allowing her in could lead to misunderstandings. The author isn't hiding anything harmful, but he's protecting the dynamic of his group chat.\n\nIs the author's refusal reasonable? Yes, because the chat is a private space with specific dynamics. However, the way he's handling it might be causing unnecessary tension. He's not giving her a middle ground, like a separate chat or a way to be included without full access. The girlfriend's perspective is about feeling valued, which is a legitimate relationship concern. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to compromise his privacy, but he might be wrong for not addressing her feelings adequately. However, the question is whether he's *in the wrong*, which typically implies a moral or ethical fault. Since he's not violating any explicit rules or agreements, maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's room for compromise. But the options are A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the context. The answer hinges on whether privacy or inclusion takes precedence. In relationships, both sides need to communicate. The author's refusal isn't inherently wrong, so I think the answer is B.\n"
