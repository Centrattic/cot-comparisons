For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his friends have a private Discord server they've had for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months because she's interested in what they discuss. The author refuses, explaining that the chat is for gaming and banter among his friends, which she's not part of, and he's worried it would ruin the dynamic or cause confusion. She feels it's about trust and privacy, comparing it to her reading his messages, but he argues it's different because the chat is public (though private in access). \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The core issue is privacy versus inclusion. The author's main points are about privacy, the nature of the group (friends who game and have specific humor), and the potential for misunderstanding. The girlfriend feels excluded and that the author is hiding something.\n\nI need to evaluate if refusing to share the Discord is a breach of trust or if it's a reasonable privacy boundary. On one hand, couples often share aspects of their lives, but there's also a balance between personal space and relationship transparency. The author isn't hiding harmful behavior but is protecting a specific social circle's privacy. The girlfriend's analogy about text messages might not hold since a private group isn't the same as personal texts. \n\nThe author has valid reasons: the group isn't meant for outsiders, and including her might disrupt the group's dynamics. However, the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion are real and need addressing. The key here is whether the refusal is a privacy boundary or an act of exclusion. Since the author isn't sharing personal information about her and the group is a specific social circle, it's more about personal choice. \n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is that she's not being included in his life, which is a common relationship issue. However, the author isn't obligated to merge all his social spaces with hers. There's a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her, but the author doesn't mention that. Still, the initial refusal isn't inherently wrong if done respectfully. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
