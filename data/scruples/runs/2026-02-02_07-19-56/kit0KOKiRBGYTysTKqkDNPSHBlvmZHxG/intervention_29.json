For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author who refuses to let their girlfriend join their private Discord chat is in the wrong. The author's friends have been gaming and joking around for two years, and the girlfriend has been asking to join because she's interested. The author refuses, explaining that she's not into gaming, the humor is different, and they don't want her to misunderstand their banter. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is protective of their private space, which makes sense. Friends have their own dynamic, and adding someone new, especially a partner, can change the group's vibe. The author's concern about privacy and potential misinterpretation of their jokes is valid. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about inclusion and feeling part of his social circle. She might see the refusal as a lack of openness or trust.\n\nThe author argues that the girlfriend's analogy (comparing it to joining her group chat) doesn't hold because their Discord is private. But she feels it's not the same. The key here is communication. The author isn't hiding anything, but the girlfriend's discomfort with not being included is causing tension. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on how they handle it. If the author is being dismissive of her feelings without explanation, that's a problem. But the author does explain their reasoning, which is a good step. The issue might be that the girlfriend isn't satisfied with those explanations, leading to mistrust. The author isn't being unfaithful or secretive, just valuing their friends' privacy and the group's dynamic. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. The author could consider creating a separate space for her to join if possible, without integrating into the main chat. That way, she feels included without disrupting the existing group. But the author might not want to do that, which is their right. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author isn't necessarily at fault for maintaining their privacy. The problem might be in the communication and finding a middle ground. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded, which is a valid concern in relationships. But the author isn't violating any clear boundary unless they're being dishonest. Since they're not hiding anything and explaining their reasoning, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the situation is nuanced, and both could benefit from better understanding each other's needs.\n"
