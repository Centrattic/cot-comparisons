For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their private Discord chat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author explains that their girlfriend has been asking to join the Discord for the past two months. The group has been together for two years, and they're close friends who game and have a lot of in-jokes. The author thinks she wouldn't fit in because she's not into gaming, doesn't understand their humor, and they don't want her to see their sarcastic banter. They also worry it might ruin the dynamics of the group. The girlfriend feels it's a privacy issue and that the author isn't being open, even though he says the chat is private.\n\nThe key points here are about privacy versus inclusion. The author values their privacy and the existing group's dynamic, while the girlfriend wants to be included and feels left out. The author argues that it's not the same as her joining her friends' group chat because Discord is public, even though it's private. The girlfriend doesn't agree and feels the author isn't being transparent.\n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy, but the girlfriend sees it as a lack of openness. The author isn't doing anything harmful, but the girlfriend is concerned. The author might not be wrong in wanting to keep the group private, but maybe there's a way to address her concerns without compromising the group's dynamic. For example, maybe a separate channel just for her? But the author doesn't mention that. They stick to their reasons and feel it's a privacy issue. However, the girlfriend is trying to express a need for inclusion and trust. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance both partners' needs. If the author is firm on not letting her join, they need to communicate why clearly and validate her feelings. The girlfriend also needs to respect the author's boundaries. But since the author is causing her distress without acknowledging her perspective, maybe there's a part where the author is in the wrong? Or is it a misunderstanding? The author isn't hiding something bad; they're just keeping their friends' chat private. The girlfriend's analogy might be flawed, but her feelings are valid. \n\nI think the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason to keep the chat private. However, communication could be better. The girlfriend needs to respect that boundary unless there's a valid reason to question the author's actions. The author isn't doing anything harmful, just maintaining privacy. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations here. So, the answer is B.\n"
