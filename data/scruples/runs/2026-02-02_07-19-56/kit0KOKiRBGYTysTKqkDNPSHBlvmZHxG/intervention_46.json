For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting the girlfriend join a private Discord chat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has a private Discord server with friends for almost two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months. The author refuses because the chat is for gaming and banter, which the girlfriend isn't into. The author is concerned about privacy and the group dynamic. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. On one hand, the author is protecting their privacy and the existing group's dynamics. They explain that the chat is private, and including someone who's not a friend might disrupt the group. On the other hand, the girlfriend wants to be included and feels that the author isn't being open, which might affect their relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are important. The author's reasoning is valid\u2014they don't want their private space invaded. However, the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion are also valid. The author could be seen as inconsiderate if they're not making any effort to include her in other ways. But the author also has a right to privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend compares it to the author joining her group chat, but the author explains that Discord is public yet private in this case. The girlfriend's trust is an issue here. The author hasn't done anything wrong, but the refusal without offering alternatives might be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's privacy is important, but not letting the girlfriend join without explaining properly might hurt her feelings. However, the author has a legitimate reason. It's a balance between privacy and relationship needs. The answer depends on whether not allowing her to join, despite valid reasons, is considered wrong. \n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, the community often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. The author's reasons are valid, but maybe they could find a middle ground, like a separate channel. Since the author is firm in their stance without compromise, maybe they are a little in the wrong. But the main issue is the girlfriend's trust and the author not addressing that. \n\nHmm. I think the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to privacy. However, the author could be a little understanding and find a solution. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So Answer B.\n"
