For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author should let their girlfriend join their private Discord chat.\n\nFirst, the author's friends have been part of this Discord chat for almost two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but the author keeps refusing. The main reasons given are that the group isn't her friends, she's not into gaming, and the humor and banter are things she might not understand. Also, the author is worried that her joining would ruin the chat's dynamic and privacy. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something, even though he's not. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy, but the girlfriend argues that it's different from personal messages.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for not letting her in? Let's break it down. The author has a private group with friends, which is a common thing. Privacy is important, especially in close-knit groups where people might say things they wouldn't in front of others. The author has valid concerns about the group's dynamics and privacy. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels left out and wants to be included, which is also a valid feeling in a relationship. \n\nBut the author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's just not allowing her into his private space. The girlfriend is asking for access to something that's private and not necessarily meant for her. It's like asking to read someone's personal messages with friends. Even though the girlfriend might argue it's not the same, the core issue is about privacy versus inclusion. The author isn't doing anything harmful by not letting her in, but the girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she wants to be part of that aspect of his life. However, the author isn't obligated to share all his private spaces with a partner, especially if it's not appropriate. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual understanding are key. The author has tried explaining why the chat isn't a good fit, but the girlfriend isn't satisfied. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's need for inclusion versus the author's right to privacy. The author isn't hiding anything harmful; he's just maintaining the privacy of his friend group. So, the answer here would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author has the right to keep his private chat private.\n"
