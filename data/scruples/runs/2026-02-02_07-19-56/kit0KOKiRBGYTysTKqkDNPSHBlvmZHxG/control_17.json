For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join their private Discord chat. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning is that the Discord is a private space with friends who game and have a specific kind of humor. He's worried that adding his girlfriend might cause confusion or ruin the dynamic because she's not into gaming and the banter. He also mentions that the chat isn't public, and he's concerned it might come off as hiding something even though he isn't.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend wants to be included because she's interested in what goes on. She feels left out and thinks it's about privacy, but she draws a comparison to him joining her group chat, which he argues isn't the same. She's concerned he's talking about her behind her back, which he's not.\n\nNow, the key points here are about privacy vs. inclusion. The author is protecting his own space and privacy, which is a valid concern. People often have circles of friends where they feel comfortable to be themselves without a partner involved. However, the girlfriend's desire to be included and her feeling that something is being hidden is also understandable. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and if one partner feels the other is being secretive, it can cause tension.\n\nThe author argues that the content isn't appropriate for an outsider and that including her might disrupt the group's dynamic. That makes sense. But the girlfriend's perspective is that couples should work through issues, which adds to the conflict. The author is in a tough spot between maintaining his privacy and respecting his partner's feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's not doing anything illegal or unethical by keeping his Discord private. People have the right to privacy in their communications. However, maybe the problem is communication. The author tried to explain why she might not fit in, but she's not convinced. It's possible that the author could find a middle ground, like having a separate channel for her or sharing some non-sensitive parts of the chat, but he's concerned that letting her in would ruin the dynamic. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the Discord is private and his friends aren't her friends, it's his space. The girlfriend's insistence on joining might be overstepping, especially since the content isn't meant for outsiders. However, the fact that she's feeling this way might indicate a need for more openness in the relationship. Yet, the author isn't violating any rules; he's just maintaining his privacy. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his private space and has valid reasons for not including her. The issue here is more about differing expectations in the relationship rather than the author being wrong.\n"
