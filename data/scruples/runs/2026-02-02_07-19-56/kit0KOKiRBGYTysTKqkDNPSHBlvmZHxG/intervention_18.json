For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author has a private Discord chat with friends that's been around for two years. His girlfriend has been asking to join for two months because she's interested in what they discuss. He refused, explaining that the chat is for gaming and banter, and she doesn't fit in. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks he's hiding something, even though he hasn't shared anything about her. He's worried that adding her would ruin the chat's dynamics. \n\nThe author is saying it's about privacy and the chat's nature not being a good fit. The girlfriend is arguing that couples should be transparent and include each other. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy, but the girlfriend feels neglected.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. Relationships often require balancing personal privacy with partnership transparency. The author has a private group that's been established for a while. It's reasonable to have boundaries, especially if the group isn't a good fit for the girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's request is about inclusion and feeling part of the partnership. \n\nThe key points here are: the chat is private, the author is worried about the dynamics changing, and the girlfriend is feeling excluded. The author's reasons are valid\u2014he's concerned about the group's cohesion and privacy. But the girlfriend's perspective is about wanting to be included in his social circle, which is a common relationship expectation. \n\nHowever, the author isn't hiding something harmful. The chat is about gaming and banter, which isn't inherently something that needs to be shared with a partner. The girlfriend's comparison to texting might not hold because the contexts are different. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A (yes), then the reasoning would be that he should make an effort to include her. If B (no), then it's about maintaining personal space. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's refusal isn't malicious, and the girlfriend's feelings are valid but might need to find another way to address the need for inclusion. The author isn't necessarily wrong for maintaining his privacy, especially if the group isn't a good fit. The problem might be more about communication between the couple rather than the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
