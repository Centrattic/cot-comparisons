For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord chat.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They've had a private Discord chat with friends for two years. Their girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but the author is hesitant. The reasons given are that the chat is for gaming, with friends who aren't her friends, and the humor is sarcastic. The author fears she wouldn't fit in and that her presence might ruin the chat. Also, they mention privacy concerns, as the chat isn't serious and includes things they wouldn't want an outsider to see. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something, even though he's not.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's side: She wants to be included, feels her concerns are valid, and compares it to joining her group chat. The author says it's not the same because the Discord is private, but she's still upset. She thinks the author should make an effort to include her, which is a common expectation in relationships where partners want to feel part of each other's circles.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamics standpoint, communication is key. The author is making a case for privacy and the nature of the group. But the girlfriend feels her needs aren't being considered. The author argues that inviting her would disrupt the group's dynamic, but maybe there's a middle ground, like creating a separate channel for her or a new group where she can interact. However, the author is firm in their stance, leading to the girlfriend feeling excluded.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the decision to exclude someone from a private group can be seen as a personal choice, especially if it's a long-standing group with close friends. The author has valid reasons about the group's nature and privacy. However, not being open to any compromise or alternative solutions might be a point against them. The girlfriend is seeking inclusion, which is a reasonable request, but the author's refusal is based on their own boundaries and comfort.\n\nIn relationships, balance is important. The author is standing by their privacy, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. However, since the group is private and the author has explained their reasoning, it's a matter of differing values. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect their privacy and the group's dynamic. But maybe they could have explored other options to include her without compromising the original group. Still, the decision to not let her join isn't inherently wrong. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
