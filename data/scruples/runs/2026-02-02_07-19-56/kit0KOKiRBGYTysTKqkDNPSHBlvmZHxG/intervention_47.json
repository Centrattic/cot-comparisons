For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord server. The girlfriend has been asking for two months, and she's upset because she feels excluded. The author's main reasons are that the server is for gaming friends, the humor might be confusing, and he doesn't want to include her because it could ruin the server's dynamic. He also mentions that she doesn't understand it's a private group and compares it to her wanting him in her personal chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships. Communication is key. The author says he's tried explaining, but the girlfriend isn't satisfied. Maybe he didn't communicate his reasons clearly enough. The girlfriend might feel her needs for inclusion aren't being met. On the other hand, the server is a private space for close friends, and he might have valid privacy concerns. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe creating a separate channel for her or introducing her to the friends in a different way. The author could be rigid in his stance without considering alternatives. The girlfriend's perspective is valid too; she wants to feel part of his life. However, the author isn't obligated to share every part of his life, especially if it's a private group. \n\nThe comparison to her text messages might not be fair. Texts are more personal, while a Discord server, even private, is a group space. The author's refusal isn't necessarily hiding something if the content isn't malicious. But the girlfriend's feelings of being excluded are real. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author hasn't done anything harmful, but the lack of compromise could be an issue. Maybe he should have explored options to include her without compromising the server's integrity. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's room for him to improve communication and find a solution that respects both his privacy and her need for inclusion.\n"
