For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord chat. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months. The author's friends have been in the chat for two years. The friends are just gaming and banter. The author is concerned about privacy, the girlfriend not fitting in, and possible confusion from their humor.\n\nThe author's reasons: He thinks she wouldn't fit in because she's not into gaming, doesn't understand their humor, and he doesn't want outsiders seeing their private chats. He compares it to her joining his group chat, but she disagrees.\n\nThe girlfriend feels left out and thinks he's hiding something. She's upset he's not being open. The author can't prove he's not talking about her, which is causing trust issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key here is about privacy versus inclusion in a relationship. The author is protecting his private space with friends, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend's request is about wanting to be included in his social life. \n\nIs denying her request a privacy issue or a relationship issue? The author has the right to keep his chat private, but relationships require some level of transparency. The problem might be in the communication. The author's refusal is causing her to feel excluded and not trusted. \n\nHe tried explaining it's like her joining his group chat, but she says it's different. The fact that he can't prove he's not talking about her is a problem for her. Maybe the author isn't being as open as he could be. \n\nOn one hand, privacy is important. On the other, the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion are valid. The author might not be wrong entirely, but there's a misunderstanding here. The answer depends on whether privacy takes precedence over relationship inclusion. \n\nIn relationships, couples often need to find a middle ground. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting privacy, but he might need to address her feelings. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because he's protecting his private space, but he could work on communication. However, some might argue that he should make accommodations. But the core issue is his privacy vs her inclusion. Since he's the one who set the private chat, he's not wrong for keeping it that way. So answer B.\n"
