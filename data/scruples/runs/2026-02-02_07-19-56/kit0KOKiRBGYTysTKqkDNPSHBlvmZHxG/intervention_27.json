For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord chat. The situation involves a private chat among friends, and the girlfriend wants to be included. The author argues that the chat is for gaming and banter that the girlfriend wouldn't fit into, and they don't want outsiders to see their private discussions. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main points are about privacy and the nature of the group chat. They mention that the chat is a private space for friends with inside jokes and sarcasm, which might not be suitable or understood by someone new, especially if they're not into gaming. The author also feels that allowing the girlfriend in could ruin the dynamic of the group.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is about inclusion and communication in the relationship. She wants to know what her partner is doing with his friends and feels that being excluded is a breach of trust. She compares it to her joining his friends' group chats, which the author disagrees with because Discord is private. The girlfriend's trust is shaken, and she suspects the author might be talking about her, even though he's not.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Relationship dynamics can be complex here. Privacy is important, but so is mutual trust and respect. The author is protecting his personal space with friends, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion and lack of trust are valid concerns. The key here is communication. The author has tried to explain why the chat isn't suitable, but the girlfriend isn't satisfied. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for keeping the chat private, as he's justified his reasons. However, if the girlfriend's feelings are causing strain, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, creating a separate private channel for her to interact with the group if she's interested. But the author believes that would ruin the chat, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe girlfriend might need to respect the author's privacy while also addressing her insecurities. The author isn't hiding something malicious; he's explaining the dynamics. Yet, her inability to accept the explanation could indicate a deeper issue in the relationship regarding trust. \n\nIn conclusion, both parties have valid points. The author's privacy and the nature of the group are legitimate reasons, but the girlfriend's need for inclusion and trust is also important. However, since the author has made a reasonable effort to explain and isn't being secretive, it might not be his fault. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's protecting his private space, but there's room for discussion about compromise. However, since the girlfriend isn't being accommodating and is causing conflict, the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
