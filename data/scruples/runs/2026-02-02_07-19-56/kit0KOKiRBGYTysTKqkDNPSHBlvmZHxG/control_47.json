For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has a private Discord server with friends that's been around for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months. The boyfriend says no, and she gets upset, feeling excluded. He argues that the chat is for gaming and banter, which she's not into, and that including her might ruin the dynamic. She compares it to him wanting to read her texts, but he clarifies the Discord is private. She doesn't believe him and thinks he's hiding things, even though he hasn't. He feels like his privacy is being invaded, and she's using the logic that couples should address issues if they're causing problems.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's consider both sides. The boyfriend's perspective is about privacy and the nature of the group. It's a long-standing, private group with inside jokes and a specific culture that might not be welcoming to an outsider, especially someone not into gaming. He's concerned that including her could disrupt the group's vibe. Also, he feels she's not respecting his privacy, as she's making assumptions he's hiding things even without evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is seeking inclusion and feels left out. She might want to feel more connected to her partner's life, especially since they are in a relationship. Her argument is about openness and transparency, which are important in relationships. She might feel that being excluded from this part of his life is a form of keeping secrets, even if he's not. The comparison to her reading his texts is a bit different because texts are personal conversations, while Discord could be seen as public, but it's private, so maybe she's conflating the two. Her frustration stems from not being included in what she perceives as a shared space.\n\nNow, the key factors here are privacy, communication, and mutual respect. The boyfriend has a right to privacy regarding his personal group chats with friends, especially if they're not inclusive by design. However, in a relationship, there's also an expectation of transparency and effort to include the partner in one's life. But inclusion doesn't mean forcing someone into a space where they don't fit or might feel uncomfortable. The boyfriend is honest about the group's nature and the potential issues, which is good communication.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, which is valid, but she's also making assumptions about the boyfriend's behavior without evidence. The boyfriend isn't being secretive; he's just not sharing a specific part of his life that he doesn't think is suitable for her. The problem arises when she equates privacy with secrecy, leading to mistrust. However, the boyfriend isn't hiding anything; he's explaining why it's not appropriate. \n\nIs the boyfriend in the wrong? If he's been clear about the reasons and the nature of the group, and she's still demanding inclusion despite his reservations, maybe she's not respecting his boundaries. The boyfriend isn't obligated to let her into a private group he's part of with friends unless it's something that's open and inclusive. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, there's a balance. The boyfriend could create a separate, more inclusive space for her if he's willing to make an effort, but that's not the same as forcing her into the existing one. \n\nWait, but the boyfriend hasn't offered an alternative. Maybe he could have created a separate group where she can be included without affecting the original. But he hasn't done that, so does that make him wrong? It depends on the situation. If the existing group is inherently exclusive, maybe he's not wrong to keep it separate. The girlfriend's request might be reasonable, but the execution is causing conflict. \n\nIn terms of the AITA, the boyfriend is explaining his reasons, which suggests he's not being intentionally rude. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling excluded, but she's not respecting his privacy and the nature of the group. So the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for not letting her join, but maybe both sides have some fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's explaining his reasons and standing by his decision, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The girlfriend needs to respect his privacy and boundaries, and maybe find other ways to connect.\n"
