For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. The situation is that the girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, and the author keeps declining. He explains that the chat is a private group of friends who game and have a specific humor, which she might not fit into. He's worried about her misunderstanding the banter and it ruining the chat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is about privacy and the nature of the chat. He's concerned about her not knowing the context and potential confusion. Also, he mentions that the chat is private, so it's not a public space. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels left out and thinks it's a matter of inclusion in the relationship. She compares it to him being in her group chat, but he argues that's different because text messages are more personal. The comparison might not be fair, but her feeling that she's being excluded is real.\n\nThe author is worried about privacy and the dynamic of the group. But the girlfriend is feeling that he's not being open. Is not allowing her to join a form of hiding something? The author says he's not doing anything wrong, but he can't prove it unless he lets her in. There's a communication issue here. The author might be right about the group's dynamics, but maybe he's not addressing her need for inclusion properly. \n\nIs the author wrong? If he's not doing anything harmful, maybe he's not wrong. However, the girlfriend's request is about being part of his social circle. In relationships, balance is key. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his privacy over his partner's feelings. But if the chat isn't a good fit, maybe he's justified. The key point is whether excluding her is reasonable. Since the group isn't hers and the content might not be appropriate, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the communication aspect is important. Maybe he should explain it better or find a middle ground. But the question is if he's in the wrong. If he's clear and honest, maybe not. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's protecting his privacy and the group's dynamic, but there's room for discussion on how to handle her feelings. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
