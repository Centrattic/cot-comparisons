For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend into their private Discord chat. The friends have had the chat for two years, and the girlfriend has been asking to join for two months. She's annoyed because she feels excluded, and the author is worried about privacy and the chat's dynamic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wants to be included and feels her request is reasonable since couples should share things. The author is concerned about privacy, the chat's content being game-related and using humor she might not get, and the possibility that her joining could disrupt the group. \n\nIs there a wrongdoing here? Well, the author is protecting their personal space and the dynamics of their established group. It's a private chat, so they have a right to control who's in it. However, the girlfriend's feelings of being excluded are valid too. The key points are about mutual respect and communication. The author might not be in the wrong if they're clear about the reasons and if the chat is indeed private. But maybe they could have found a middle ground, like letting her join but setting boundaries or explaining the content better. \n\nThe girlfriend comparing it to reading texts might not be the same since the Discord is private and requires invitation. The author didn't want to compromise their privacy, which is understandable. However, not letting her in without any compromise could be seen as not making an effort to include her. But the author's justification is that it's not suitable for her. \n\nI should check if there's any expectation in the relationship that requires sharing such spaces. If the girlfriend feels her partner is being closed-off, that's a relationship issue. The author might be right to protect their privacy but could be wrong in not finding a solution that addresses the girlfriend's concerns without fully compromising the group's dynamic. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author has valid privacy concerns and the chat isn't meant for her. But if the girlfriend's request is about trust and inclusion, maybe there's a need for better communication. However, the author isn't obligated to let her in, especially if it could affect the group negatively. The main issue is the invasion of privacy vs. the need for inclusion in a relationship. Since the chat is private and the author's reasons are about privacy and group dynamics, they might not be in the wrong. So, B.\n"
