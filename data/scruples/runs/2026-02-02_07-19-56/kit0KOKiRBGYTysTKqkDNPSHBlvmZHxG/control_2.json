For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord chat. They want a yes or no answer based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has a private Discord chat with friends that's been around for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but the author refuses because they feel she doesn't fit in\u2014she's not into gaming, the humor, or the friends. The author is concerned that her joining would ruin the chat dynamics and invade privacy since the group is very sarcastic and casual. The girlfriend is upset, feeling excluded and thinks the author is hiding something. The author can't prove their innocence without letting her in, which would compromise privacy.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's rationale is about privacy and group dynamics. They don't want outsiders in a private, established group where the content is specific to their shared interests and humor. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels her partner isn't being open and is prioritizing friends over her. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author's friends are part of a private chat, which is a personal space. It's reasonable for the author to want to maintain that space without external members, especially if it could change the group's vibe or cause misunderstandings. The author isn't doing anything harmful by keeping it private. The girlfriend's request is about inclusion, but the author's reasons are valid regarding privacy and group compatibility. \n\nHowever, communication is key in relationships. The author might need to explain why the privacy is important and reassure the girlfriend that there's no secret behavior, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong for refusing the request. The girlfriend's comparison to text messages is flawed because Discord is public, but the author clarifies it's private. The author isn't hiding personal information; it's just a different type of privacy. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason based on privacy and group dynamics. The issue is about balancing personal space with relationship expectations. The answer should be B.\n"
