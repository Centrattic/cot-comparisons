For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord server. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the Discord has been around for two years with friends. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months. The author says no, and she's upset. She feels excluded and thinks he's hiding something. The author's reasoning is that the chat is just gaming and banter, which she's not into. He's worried about her understanding the humor and that it might cause confusion. He also mentions that the chat isn't for outsiders, and he's concerned it would ruin the group dynamic. He tried comparing it to her checking his text messages, but she disagrees.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is protecting his privacy and the dynamics of his group. He's justified in not wanting to include someone who's not part of the original group. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels excluded and untrusted. The author's refusal might be seen as not being open, especially if it's causing her distress. But the author has valid reasons: the group's content is specific, and including an outsider could disrupt it. \n\nThe girlfriend's concern is about transparency in the relationship. She might feel that there's something he's hiding. However, the author isn't sharing private messages but rather a private group that's separate from their personal relationship. The comparison to her reading his texts isn't the same because the Discord is a different space. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could create a separate server or a different channel where they can both interact without the original group. But the author hasn't done that. Still, the refusal itself isn't necessarily wrong since it's his privacy. The key point is communication. If the author has explained his reasons clearly and she still isn't satisfied, then maybe there's a deeper issue in the relationship. However, the author isn't doing anything harmful by keeping his privacy. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but the situation requires better communication and compromise from both sides.\n"
