For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord server.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author explains that his friends have a private Discord chat they've had for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months, but he's been refusing. His reasons are that the group isn't her friends, she doesn't play games, and their humor might confuse her. He's worried she might misinterpret their banter and that her presence could ruin the chat. He also mentioned privacy concerns, comparing it to her wanting him to join her friends' group chat. She's upset, thinking he's hiding something, even though he hasn't told his friends anything about her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate that. Let me break it down. On one hand, the girlfriend's perspective is about inclusion and transparency in the relationship. She might feel left out or not trusted, especially if she's asking to be part of his social circle. The author's comparison to her joining her friends' group chat might not hold because Discord servers can be more open (though he says his is private). But the key here is the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's privacy and comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not wanting her to join. The group is private, but he's concerned about how his friends interact, which is casual and maybe not respectful if someone doesn't understand the context. He's worried about her misreading the banter as negative, leading to misunderstandings. Also, he feels that her joining might change the dynamic of the group, which is a legitimate concern about group dynamics in close-knit friendships.\n\nNow, considering relationship advice, communication is key. The author did explain his reasons, but the girlfriend is still upset. Maybe the author could find a compromise, like having one-on-one chats with her about the server or introducing her to some friends outside the server. But the author feels that joining the server would be an invasion of privacy, which is also a valid point.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a privacy standpoint, he has the right to keep his private server private. However, in a relationship, partners might expect some level of inclusion and transparency. The girlfriend's request is reasonable, but the author's refusal is based on valid concerns. It's a balancing act between privacy and relationship expectations.\n\nIn some cases, not being open might lead to trust issues. The girlfriend's frustration is understandable if she feels excluded. But the author isn't breaking any rules; it's his server to manage. The problem is more about differing expectations in the relationship rather than the author being objectively wrong. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has a right to privacy and valid reasons, though communication could be improved.\n"
