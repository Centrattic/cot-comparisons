For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not letting their girlfriend join their private Discord server.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friends have had the Discord for two years, and the girlfriend has been interested for the past two months. The author is concerned about privacy, humor, and the potential for confusion or disruption. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something, even though he claims he isn't.\n\nThe author's reasoning: the group is for gaming, which she's not into, and their banter might not be suitable. He doesn't want her to misinterpret things. The girlfriend compares it to group chats but argues that Discord is public, even though it's private. She's upset and feels the author isn't being open.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author has a right to privacy in his private group. If the group is a space for specific people (gaming friends with inside jokes), it's reasonable to keep it as is. On the other hand, the girlfriend is asking to be included, which might be about making her feel part of his life. The author's concern is valid, but the girlfriend's feelings are also important. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal, but relationships require communication and compromise. The author's refusal might be seen as not accommodating his partner's needs, but he's also justified in protecting his private space. The girlfriend's analogy about group chats isn't perfect, but her feeling of being excluded is real. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. However, the key point is that the author's group is private and not intended for outsiders. Since the girlfriend isn't part of the group's original purpose, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not inviting her. The problem lies more in the communication and mutual understanding rather than a clear ethical wrong.\n"
