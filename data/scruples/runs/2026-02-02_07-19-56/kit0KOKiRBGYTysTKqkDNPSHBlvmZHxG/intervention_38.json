For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend not letting his girlfriend join his private Discord server. The girlfriend is upset and feels excluded, while the boyfriend thinks it's just his friends and the content isn't suitable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's friends have been in the server for two years, and it's a private group. He's concerned about privacy, the nature of the humor, and that she might not fit in. The girlfriend feels left out and thinks he's being closed off, even suspecting he's talking about her behind her back. \n\nThe key points here are privacy and communication. The boyfriend is protecting his private space, which is understandable. People often have private groups for close friends, especially if the content isn't intended for outsiders. However, the girlfriend's feelings of being excluded are valid too. Relationships require compromise and inclusion, so maybe the boyfriend should have considered other ways to include her without compromising the group's dynamic.\n\nBut the boyfriend did explain the reasons. He mentioned the group's humor and gaming focus, which she isn't part of. Also, he compared it to her joining his friends' text messages, which she dismissed. The girlfriend's insistence on joining to prove trust might not align with the boyfriend's boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether the refusal is wrong. In some cases, partners might need to adjust for each other. However, if the group is truly private and not meant for outsiders, the boyfriend isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue might be more about how he communicated it. Did he offer alternatives? Maybe suggest a separate group where she could participate without affecting the existing one. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is partly due to feeling excluded, which is a common relationship issue. But the boyfriend has the right to maintain his privacy. So, the answer might hinge on whether the refusal is a legitimate boundary or an unnecessary exclusion. \n\nConsidering all factors, the boyfriend isn't in the wrong for maintaining his privacy and the integrity of his friends' group. The problem might stem from a communication breakdown rather than the refusal itself. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
