For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord chat. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has a private Discord server with friends he's known for two years. The girlfriend has been asking to join for two months because she's interested. The author refuses, explaining that the chat is for gaming and humor, and she's not into games. He's concerned about privacy and that outsiders (like her) don't fit in. The girlfriend feels excluded and thinks he's hiding something. He says he's not sharing anything negative about her, but she can't believe him unless she joins. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy but also acknowledges that couples should address each other's concerns.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's stance is about privacy and the nature of the chat. His friends aren't hers, and the chat is game-related and sarcastic. He's worried she'd be confused or it'd ruin the chat. His girlfriend is feeling left out and not trusted. The author is in a position where his privacy is important, but so is his partner's feelings of inclusion. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to privacy in his private chat. If he doesn't want her to see the content, that's his choice. On the other hand, in a relationship, communication and compromise are key. The girlfriend is asking to be included, and the author is not budging, leading to her feeling excluded. However, the author's reasons are valid: the chat's nature and privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend's analogy about joining her group chat isn't the same. Texting is more personal, but Discord is public, but in this case, it's private. The author could consider creating a separate channel for them or adjusting the chat to include her if possible. However, the author is clear that the chat is for specific friends and that she wouldn't fit in. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If he's not sharing anything harmful and the chat is private, he isn't necessarily wrong. But if refusing to include her without a valid reason is causing harm to the relationship, maybe he's not handling it well. However, the author's reasons are practical. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a middle ground where communication could be improved. But given the choices, the author's actions are justified based on privacy and the chat's nature. Therefore, answer B.\n"
