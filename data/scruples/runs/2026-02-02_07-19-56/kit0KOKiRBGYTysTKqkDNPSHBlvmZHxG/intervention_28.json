For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting his girlfriend join his Discord chat. The author's friends have been in the chat for two years. The girlfriend has asked to join for two months, but he says no. She's upset because she feels excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. He mentions the chat is for gaming, with inside jokes and sarcasm that she wouldn't get. He's worried about privacy since they talk casually and maybe things could be misinterpreted. He also compared it to her joining his text messages, but she argues it's different because Discord is public, even though he says it's private. \n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective: she feels like he's not being open and might be hiding something. Couples often expect inclusion and transparency, so her concern isn't unfounded. The author isn't sharing the same level of openness he expects from her, which could create trust issues. \n\nBut the author's concern about privacy is valid. He's part of a male group chat that's been around a while; adding a partner might change the dynamic. The chat's culture is specific, and including someone not part of the original group might not be natural. \n\nThe key points are transparency vs. privacy. The author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful, but the girlfriend's feelings of exclusion are important. The author could have tried to include her in a different way, maybe a separate group or introducing her to the friends, but he didn't. However, he's not obligated to share all his spaces. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could explain his reasons better, but he's not necessarily in the wrong. It's a balance between personal boundaries and relationship expectations. Since the author isn't violating any trust or rules, and the chat is private, the answer leans towards B.\n"
