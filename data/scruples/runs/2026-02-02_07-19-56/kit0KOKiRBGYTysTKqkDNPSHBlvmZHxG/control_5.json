For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their Discord server. \n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author's reasoning is that the Discord chat is a private group with friends who game and have a specific kind of humor. They're worried that the girlfriend wouldn't fit in and that her joining might ruin the dynamic. Also, they mention privacy concerns, even though the server is private. The girlfriend feels left out and thinks the author is hiding something, which is causing tension.\n\nSo, the main points here are privacy vs. inclusion in a relationship. On one hand, the author has a right to privacy regarding their friends' interactions. They might not want someone who isn't part of that circle to join. On the other hand, the girlfriend is seeking inclusion and feels her partner isn't being open, which is a valid concern in a relationship where transparency is important.\n\nThe author's argument is that the chat isn't suitable for her because of the content and the people involved. The girlfriend disagrees, comparing it to texting, which is more personal. The author insists that even though the Discord is private, it's not the same. But the girlfriend's perception is that she's being excluded, which can lead to feelings of mistrust.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics. In healthy relationships, both partners should feel respected and included. However, there's also a balance between maintaining personal spaces and meeting each other's needs. The author's refusal might be seen as protecting their privacy, but if it's causing significant distress, maybe there's a need to find a compromise. \n\nBut the author is clear that they don't want her in the Discord for practical reasons (she's not into gaming, humor, etc.), not just because they want to hide something. The girlfriend's insistence despite those reasons could be pushing the author beyond reasonable boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the refusal is based on legitimate differences (like interests and group dynamics) rather than secrecy, then maybe not. However, if the girlfriend's request is valid for her to feel included, the author might need to consider alternative ways to include her without joining the Discord, like sharing highlights or creating a separate space. But the author is firm in their stance, so maybe they're not in the wrong for setting those boundaries. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether the refusal is unjustified. Since the author has valid reasons and the girlfriend isn't part of the group, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, communication is key here. The author should explain their reasons clearly and maybe find other ways to involve her. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their private space and explaining why it's not suitable. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to change their privacy settings. So the answer is B.\n"
