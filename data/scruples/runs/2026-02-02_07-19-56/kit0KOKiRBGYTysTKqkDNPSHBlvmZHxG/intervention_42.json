For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for not letting their girlfriend join their private Discord chat. The author's reasoning is that the chat is between close friends with inside jokes and gaming discussions, and they don't want her to feel out of place. The girlfriend is upset because she feels excluded and thinks the author is hiding something.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about privacy and the dynamics of their existing group. They mention the chat isn't a public server and that it's private. Their friends might not be comfortable with an outsider joining, especially someone not into gaming. The humor and banter could be lost on her, leading to confusion. The author also fears that including her might disrupt the group's vibe.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend feels ignored and not trusted. She wants to be part of the author's social circle and is frustrated by the refusal. The author compared it to her joining his messages, but she argues that Discord is public (even though it's private here). The author can't prove they're not talking about her, which is causing trust issues.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main points are privacy vs. inclusion in a relationship. In relationships, communication and compromise are key. While the author has valid privacy concerns, the girlfriend is seeking inclusion. The author's refusal might be seen as not making an effort to include her, which could be a relational issue. However, the author's reasoning is about protecting their existing group's dynamic and privacy. \n\nIt's a tricky balance. If the author is being stubborn without considering alternatives, like creating a separate group for the girlfriend to join, that could tip the scales. But if the author is reasonable and the group isn't meant for outsiders, then it's more about privacy. The girlfriend's insistence that it's a public chat (even though it's private) might indicate a misunderstanding, but her feelings are valid. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether someone acted unreasonably. Here, the author might be in the right because they have a legitimate reason for privacy and the group's nature. However, the refusal to compromise at all might be a problem. The author could be expected to explain the situation better or find a middle ground, like a separate, more inclusive channel. But the author hasn't done that; they just said no. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is being overly rigid. If they're not willing to consider any solution that addresses the girlfriend's need for inclusion, that's where they might be in the wrong. But if they genuinely can't include her without harming the group or privacy, then they might not be. The girlfriend's demand to join to prove innocence is a bit of a trap, as the author can't do that without compromising their privacy.\n"
