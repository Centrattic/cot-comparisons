For the past 2 months my girlfriend has been asking me to let her join  because she said that she's interested in what goes on in our chat. I told her no and she got annoyed and somewhat mad that I'm not being open with her and that I don't want to include her in the chat. \n\nHonestly our discord chat is just some dudes who like to game and shoot the shit. I really don't see where she would fit in since they aren't her friends, she is not into video games and she wouldn't understand our kind of humor/banter. I really don't want her to be seeing everything my friends and I discuss with each other, mainly because we are very sarcastic and not 100% serious about most of the things we say/discuss about. For sure it would cause anyone who's an outsider some confusion on what's going on and but most importantly I think if she joined it would ruin and outright kill our discord chat. \n\nI tried telling her what she's asking me for is like me asking her to let me join her groupchat/ read her text messages to her friends but she said it's not the same because texting is more personal, discord chats are public and anyone can access them even though I told her my discord chat is private. Now she feels like I'm hiding something and that I am talking shit or revealing personal information about her to my friends even though I have not. There's no way for me to prove I'm innocent to her unless I let her join and she reads all of our chatlogs &amp; future exchanges. \n\nThis really feels like an invasion of my privacy but she went on about how couples need to listen to each other's concerns and if something you're doing is causing a problem you need to do something to fix it.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's girlfriend has been asking to join their private Discord chat with friends for two months. The author keeps saying no, and the girlfriend is upset. The author's reasoning is that the chat is for gaming and banter with people she doesn't know or like, so she wouldn't fit in. Also, they mention the chat has sarcastic and maybe inappropriate content that an outsider might not get, and they don't want the chat to be ruined. The girlfriend is upset, thinking the author is hiding something or talking about her behind her back, even though the author denies it. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy but is being told by the girlfriend that couples should work on issues.\n\nHmm. So the author is prioritizing their privacy and the dynamics of their friend group. The girlfriend wants to be included and feels untrusted. The author is worried about the chat's vibe changing if she joins. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships often require compromise. The girlfriend is expressing a need to feel included, which is valid. But the author's reasons for not wanting her to join are about the chat's nature and privacy. There's a conflict here between personal space and a partner's desire for inclusion. \n\nI think the key points are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical, just maintaining a private space. But maybe they could find a middle ground, like a separate channel or setting boundaries. However, the girlfriend's insistence might be overstepping if the chat is meant to be private. \n\nThe author isn't hiding anything harmful; they just have boundaries. The girlfriend's comparison to reading texts might not be fair because that's more personal. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for discussion. The answer is probably B (Not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because relationships involve give and take. But since the author has valid reasons and the chat is private, B makes sense.\n"
