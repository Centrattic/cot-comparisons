This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost. The author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The ride was $90, and the author paid for it. Then they tried to split the cost 50/50 between themselves and the friend, but the friend thought it should be one-third each. The author is asking if they're at fault for making a $15 issue out of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs usually works in such situations. If three people are sharing a ride, the fair share would typically be each paying a third. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, so they split the cost as two entities, leading to 50/50. That's where the discrepancy comes from. The friend thought it should be one-third, which would mean the author and their girlfriend would be paying $30 each, and the friend $30, totaling $90. However, the author is charging the friend $45, making it a $15 difference.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is the initial arrangement. The author didn't ask the friend beforehand how they wanted to split the cost. They assumed they'd split it between two groups, but the friend expected a three-way split. Since there were three people, each should logically pay a third. The author's mistake was not clarifying the split before the ride. By charging the friend 50%, they're effectively making them pay more than their fair share. The $15 might seem small, but the principle is about fairness. The author is now following up with the friend, and the friend is uncomfortable, leading to tension. The author's insistence on getting the $15 might be seen as being too strict over a minor amount, especially if the friend wasn't aware of the arrangement beforehand. So, the author might be at fault for not setting clear expectations and then making a big deal out of the small amount.\n"
