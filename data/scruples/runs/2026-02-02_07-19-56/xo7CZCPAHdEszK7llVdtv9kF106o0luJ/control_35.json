This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the thread (AITA) is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 even though there were three people. The scenario is that they and their girlfriend were going to the airport, picked up a friend, and then tried to split the $90 fare 50/50 between the two of them and the friend as one-third each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs typically works in shared situations. If three people are sharing a ride, the fair split would be each paying a third. However, the user and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses 50/50. So maybe they considered themselves as a single unit here. That might be the crux of the issue.\n\nBut wait, the friend only joined because the user and girlfriend were already going to the airport. The friend's presence added to the Uber cost, so it's fair to expect them to contribute. The user paid the full fare and then tried to charge $45 each (so $45 for the friend and $45 for the user and girlfriend combined). But the friend thought it should be $30 each. \n\nThe problem here is the assumption of how to split. If the user and girlfriend are considered one entity (since they live together and normally split expenses 50/50), then splitting as two entities (user/gf vs. friend) would be 50/50, but that's not the case when there are three people. The friend's argument is that each person should pay a third. So the user is charging $45 instead of $30, which is a $15 difference. \n\nIs the user wrong for expecting the friend to pay half? Well, if the user and girlfriend are considered two people, then splitting three ways would be $30 each. But if they are considered one person (as a couple), then splitting with the friend would be 50/50, making the user's share $45. The friend probably sees it as three individuals, hence the $30. \n\nThe user's approach might not be wrong if they had communicated their expectation upfront. However, since the friend didn't agree and now the friendship is strained over $15, maybe the user shouldn't have made a big deal. The user is holding onto $15 which is a small amount but causing conflict. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend lives near the user's direction might mean he benefited more from the ride, but that's speculative. The main issue is the split method. If the user expected 50/50 between two entities (their couple and the friend), but the friend expected three ways, then the user's approach could be seen as not fair. \n\nBut maybe the user is right in their own logic. If they usually split 50/50 with their girlfriend, treating that as one unit makes sense. However, in a group setting with three people, the norm is often splitting equally unless otherwise agreed. The user didn't clarify this before the ride, which led to the misunderstanding. \n\nSo in conclusion, the user might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their expectation and now are holding the friend to a split that the friend didn't agree to. The $15 is trivial, but the insistence on splitting 50/50 without consensus is problematic. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
