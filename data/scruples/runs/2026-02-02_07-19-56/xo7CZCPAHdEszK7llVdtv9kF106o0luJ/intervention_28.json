This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost among three people. The author and their girlfriend live together and picked up a friend on the way to the airport. The Uber cost $90, and they offered to split the cost 50/50, meaning the friend pays $45. The friend thinks it should be $30 (1/3), and the author is now trying to get the $15 difference, but the friend is upset and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual way expenses are split when multiple people are involved. If three people are sharing a ride, the standard is to split equally, which would be each paying 1/3. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, so they considered splitting 50/50 between the two entities. That logic might not be standard, though. Usually, each person is considered an individual unless they're a group that's splitting costs among themselves. The author's reasoning is that they normally split expenses between them and their girlfriend equally, but here they're treating themselves as one because they live together. However, the third person might not see it that way. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectation. The author didn't clarify with the friend beforehand how they would split the cost. If the friend expected to pay 1/3, but the author assumed 50/50, that's a miscommunication. The author sent a request for $45, which the friend found unfair. The author is now making a big deal out of $15, which might strain the friendship. \n\nAnother angle is the friend's perspective: he might feel that since there were three people, each should pay an equal share. The author's approach of grouping themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity might not be fair to the friend. Additionally, the author's insistence on the $15 shows that they're prioritizing the money over the friendship, which could be seen as being in the wrong. \n\nIn many social contexts, splitting costs equally when multiple people are involved is the norm unless otherwise agreed. The author's approach of grouping themselves and their girlfriend might be a personal arrangement, but when involving a third party, it's better to be transparent. By not discussing how the cost would be split before the ride, the author might have set up an unfair situation. The friend's refusal to talk unless the author drops the $15 suggests that he values the friendship more than the money, while the author is holding a grudge over a small amount. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in assuming they can group themselves with their girlfriend and splitting 50/50 without the friend's agreement. The $15 is a small amount, but the author's insistence is causing tension. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the standard practice of splitting equally among all three and for making a big deal out of it, which could harm the friendship.\n"
