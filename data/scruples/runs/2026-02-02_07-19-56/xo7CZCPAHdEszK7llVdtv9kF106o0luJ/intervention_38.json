This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong by splitting the Uber costs 50/50 instead of 1/3 each when three people were involved. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, but they consider themselves as one unit. They had a friend join their Uber to the airport, making three people total. The ride was $90, and the author paid it all, then asked the friend for $45 (half), not $30 (a third). The friend is upset about this and the author is now asking if they're in the wrong for making a $15 issue out of it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author and girlfriend usually split things 50/50, but since they live together, maybe they're seen as a single household. However, when the friend joined the ride, the cost was shared by three people. The standard would be splitting the cost equally, which would be $30 each. But the author split it as two people (50/50), charging the friend $45. That's where the conflict comes from.\n\nNow, the author is holding onto this $15. The friend probably feels that's unfair since there were three people. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for all three parties. However, maybe the author thought since they and their girlfriend are a unit, it's two units, hence 50/50. But in reality, the friend is an individual, so splitting into three would be fairer. \n\nAnother angle: the author initiated the ride and might have assumed that the friend would chip in, but perhaps didn't clarify beforehand. If the author paid the full amount, they have a right to be reimbursed. But the calculation should be based on the actual number of people. So, charging $30 each would be fair. Charging $45 means the friend is paying more than their share, which is unfair. \n\nThe author is now being inconsiderate by not letting go of the $15. The friend might have expected to pay a third, and the author's insistence on $45 is causing the rift. The author's argument that they're a unit with their girlfriend might not hold in a situation where there are three individuals sharing a ride. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for not splitting the cost among three people and for making a big deal out of the $15. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
