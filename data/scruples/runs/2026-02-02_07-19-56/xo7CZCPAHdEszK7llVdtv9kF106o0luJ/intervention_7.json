This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. So, the scenario is that the author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The total cost was $90, and the author paid it and then asked the friend for $45 (half), but the friend thinks it should be one-third, which is $30. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for making a big deal out of a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how costs are typically split in such situations. Usually, when multiple people are in a ride, the standard is to split the cost equally among everyone. So if there are three people, each should pay one-third. However, the author grouped themselves with their girlfriend as a single entity, which is a bit unusual. The girlfriend and the author live together and usually split costs, so maybe they consider themselves as one unit, but that's not the usual practice when splitting with others. \n\nThe friend probably expected to split the total cost by the number of individuals. So three people, each paying $30. The author, by splitting it into two entities (theirself and the girlfriend as one, and the friend as another), ended up charging the friend half of the total fare, which is $45 instead of $30. That's a significant difference. \n\nThe key here is whether splitting into two entities is a fair approach. If the friend didn't know that the author and their girlfriend usually don't split costs and think of themselves as a single unit, then the expectation would be different. The author's reasoning that they usually end up even with their girlfriend might not be relevant to the friend who was expecting a three-way split. \n\nAlso, the author is now insisting on the $15 difference, which is a small amount, but the friend is avoiding the conversation. The author might be overemphasizing a minor issue, which could be causing tension. However, the initial decision to split 50/50 might have been the root of the problem. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about the fairness of the split. If the author had considered the friend as a third person, the split would be $30 each. The author's approach of grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one might be seen as unfair to the friend. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not splitting the cost equally among all three individuals. \n\nBut then again, maybe the author didn't clarify beforehand how they would split the cost. If the arrangement was informal and the friend didn't ask, the author might have responsibility in not setting clear expectations. However, the main issue is the method of splitting. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is that the author is in the wrong because they didn't split the cost equally among all three individuals and instead grouped themselves as a single entity, leading to an unfair charge for the friend.\n"
