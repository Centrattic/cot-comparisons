This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend (who live together) got an Uber to the airport, picked up a friend along the way, and then tried to split the $90 fare 50/50 between themselves as a couple and their friend. The friend thought it should be a third each, so the author sent a request for $45, but the friend is upset and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the cost division and the social implications. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, making it two entities (author+gf and friend), hence 50/50. The friend argues that since there were three people, it should be 1/3 each. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when three people share a ride, typically each should pay a third, assuming everyone benefits equally. The author's reasoning is that they usually split costs 50/50 with their girlfriend, so combining their expenses into one makes sense. However, the friend might see this as unfair because the friend only used part of the ride. But in this case, the friend was picked up on the way to the airport, so he was part of the entire trip. Unless the friend's portion of the ride was significantly shorter, the full cost would be shared by all three. \n\nBut the author called the Uber, paid the full amount, and then asked for half from the friend. If the ride was $90, and three people are sharing, each should pay $30. The author and their girlfriend combined would pay $60, and the friend $30. However, the author's approach was to split it as two people (themselves as one entity and the friend as another), hence $45 each. That's a mistake because there are three people, not two. So the author is actually the one who miscalculated the split. The correct way would be three parts, not two. \n\nThe friend is arguing for a third, which is the fair share. The author's asking for $45 is $15 more than the correct $30. The friend is probably upset because the author is trying to charge more than the fair share. The author is making a big deal out of $15, but that's because they miscalculated. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't split the cost correctly, leading to an unfair charge. \n\nAdditionally, the social aspect is important. The author's approach might have been seen as inconsiderate. Even if the math was right, asking for money after the fact can be awkward, especially if it's a one-time thing. The author's justification of \"usually splitting 50/50 with gf\" doesn't apply here because the third person wasn't part of their usual arrangement. The author should have considered that the friend might expect a third. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they incorrectly split the cost and then insisted on the amount, leading to a $15 overcharge. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
