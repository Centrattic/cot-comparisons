This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Three people ride an Uber to the airport. The author paid the full $90 and then asked their friend to pay half. The friend thinks it should be a third each. The author lives with their girlfriend and usually splits expenses 50/50, so they considered themselves as one entity and the friend as another. That's why they split it 50/50 instead of 33% each.\n\nHmm, the core issue here is about fairness in splitting costs. Typically, when three people share a ride, the standard is to split it equally, which would be $30 each. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity, so they took half (i.e., $45) and expected the friend to pay the other half. That logic might not be standard. Friends usually split the cost based on the number of people, not how they live together. \n\nAlso, the author is now being called out for being AITA (Am I the Asshole) because the friend is upset about the $15 difference. The author is focusing on a small amount, which might be seen as being petty. Even though the reasoning makes sense from their perspective, expecting someone else to pay half when there are three people isn't typical. The friend probably expected a third, which is $30. The author is charging $45, so that's $15 more than a third. The friend is unwilling to pay that extra, which is why the friendship is strained.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the problem is in the calculation. If three people are sharing a ride, splitting it 50/50 between the two people (assuming the couple is considered one) isn't fair to the third person. The standard would be splitting three ways. The author's approach is unconventional and might not be understood by the friend. Even though they usually split expenses 50/50 with their girlfriend, that's internal to their relationship. When involving another person, the standard is to split equally among all participants. \n\nTherefore, by charging half instead of a third, the author is technically overcharging the friend. The author might not be malicious, but their approach is incorrect. The friend is justified in wanting to pay a third. The author is making a big deal out of $15, which is a significant portion of the total cost from the friend's perspective. So, the author is in the wrong here because they didn't split the cost fairly according to the standard practice when three people are involved.\n"
