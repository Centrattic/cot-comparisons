This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the thread (AITA) is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. The situation is that there were three people in the Uber: the author, his girlfriend, and a friend. The total cost was $90, and the author paid and then asked the friend for $45, which is half. The friend thinks it should be a third, which is $30. The author is now wondering if he's wrong for insisting on the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs typically works in such scenarios. When multiple people are sharing a ride, it's common to split the fare based on the number of people. So three people would mean each pays a third. The author grouped himself and his girlfriend as one entity, so he's charging the friend half. But that's not accurate because each person is an individual entity. So splitting equally among three people makes sense. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he and his girlfriend usually split their expenses between themselves, so they count as one unit. But when it comes to splitting costs with others, it's standard to split per person. So if three people are in the ride, each should pay a third. The author's approach of grouping himself and the girlfriend as one unit leads to an unequal split, effectively making the friend pay more than his fair share. \n\nAnother point is that the author initiated the Uber, which might imply some responsibility, but typically, if others are joining the ride because it's cheaper for everyone, they should contribute their share. The friend's argument for a third is more logical because it's three individuals sharing the ride. \n\nThe author then made a request for $45, which is half the fare, expecting the friend to cover half. That's not fair because it's three people, so each should pay a third. The $15 difference is the issue here. The author is holding onto this $15, which might strain the friendship. \n\nIn terms of social norms, splitting the fare equally per person is the standard unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The author's approach of grouping himself and his girlfriend as a single entity isn't a common practice in shared expenses with others. So, the author is being unreasonable by not splitting the cost into thirds. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's expecting the friend to pay more than his fair share by not splitting the cost among three people.\n"
