This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting an Uber ride cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The total was $90, so the author split it as $45 each, considering the girlfriend and themselves as one entity and the friend as another. The friend thinks it should be a third each, which would be $30. The author is holding onto the $15 difference and hasn't seen the friend since.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the fairness of splitting costs. When three people share a ride, the standard would usually be splitting the cost equally. However, in this case, the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses, but in this case, they decided to count as one entity. So instead of three people, it's two entities: the couple and the friend. That's where the 50/50 comes from. But the friend expected a third because there were three people. \n\nThe author might not be wrong because they considered their living arrangement and how they usually handle expenses. However, maybe the friend didn't know about their arrangement and expected a per-person split. The author is now holding onto $15, which is a small amount but causing tension. \n\nSo, is the author at fault for splitting it 50/50? It depends on communication. If they didn't explain their reasoning upfront, maybe they should have. But if they did and the friend still didn't agree, then the author's approach is reasonable. However, holding a grudge over $15 is probably not the right way to handle it. The author might be in the wrong for making a big deal out of it, not the initial split. The question is whether the split itself was wrong. The answer might be B (No) because the split was based on their usual arrangement, but the author's reaction is the issue. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting 50/50. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not splitting it into three. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: the ride cost is based on the distance and time. If the friend was only added because they were going in the same direction and the ride was cheaper with three people, then splitting equally makes sense. But if the author's girlfriend wasn't part of the cost-sharing arrangement with the friend, then maybe the author is overcomplicating it. Wait, the author says they usually split everything with the girlfriend but this time they considered themselves as one entity. That could be their mistake. If the friend didn't know that they usually split, then expecting a third is fair. Alternatively, the author's logic is that since the couple is one unit, splitting 50/50 is appropriate, but that's not typical. Normally, each person pays their share, unless they're in a group. So if the couple counts as one, but the friend is alone, splitting 50/50 is like each \"unit\" pays half. But that's not standard. So maybe the author is in the wrong for splitting it that way without discussing. Then, the $15 issue is a result of that, so the initial split is the problem. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
