This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for splitting an Uber fare 50/50 with a friend when there were three people involved. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend paid for the Uber, then tried to split the cost 50/50 with their friend. The friend thinks it should be 1/3 each instead. The author is asking if they're in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard norms around splitting costs. Typically, when multiple people are involved in a shared expense, the split is based on the number of people. So three people would split the cost into thirds. But sometimes, if two people are sharing as a group (like a couple), they might be considered a single entity. In this case, the author mentions they live together and often split expenses evenly at the end, so maybe they see themselves as one unit. That could justify a 50/50 split between the couple and the friend.\n\nHowever, the problem here is that the friend is being asked to pay half of the total fare, which would be $45 for a $90 ride. But since there were three people, the fair share would be $30 each. The author is charging the friend $15 more than the fair share. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are one unit, but the friend might see it as three individuals. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. The author initiated the ride and paid for it, but the friend was a passenger.\n2. The author's approach is based on their usual arrangement with their girlfriend, not the friend.\n3. The friend expected a 1/3 share, which is more in line with three people sharing.\n\nThe author is making a $15 claim, which is a significant portion for the friend. Even though $15 isn't a huge amount, the principle of fairness matters here. If the author had treated it as three people, it would be $30 each. By grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one, the author is charging the friend more than his fair share. \n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, the author is splitting the cost incorrectly. They should have considered all three as separate entities unless there was prior agreement otherwise. The friend's expectation of a 1/3 split is standard, and the author's 50/50 approach might not have been communicated clearly beforehand, leading to the conflict. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for the third person correctly and are trying to charge more than the fair share. The answer should be A.\n"
