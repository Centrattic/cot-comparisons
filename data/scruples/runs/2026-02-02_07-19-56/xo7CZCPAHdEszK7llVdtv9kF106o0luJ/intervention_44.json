This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 even though there were three people. So, the situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together, and they called an Uber to take them to the airport during a busy time. They picked up a friend along the way, and the fare was $90. The author paid the whole amount and then tried to split it 50/50 with the friend, charging them $45. The friend thought they should pay a third instead, which would be $30. The author is now trying to get the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if splitting 50/50 was fair. Let's break down the facts. The author and their girlfriend live together, so they're considered one unit here. The friend is a third person. The Uber was called by the author, who paid for it. The friend was picked up along the way, so maybe he benefited from a shorter ride? Or maybe the route was longer because of him. The cost was $90, so splitting it equally among three would be $30 each. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one, making two entities, hence 50/50. \n\nBut wait, maybe the friend's presence didn't actually add to the cost? If the Uber would have cost the same whether they picked up the friend or not, then splitting 50/50 is fair. However, if the ride was longer or more expensive because of the friend, then maybe he should pay more. But in this case, the friend lives a mile or two away in the direction of the airport, so the Uber probably didn't add much to the cost. The total was $90 regardless. \n\nThe key point is whether the author and their girlfriend should be considered as one or two people. Since they live together and usually split things evenly, but in this case, they grouped as one. So if they're considered one entity, then two people: the author/boyfriend and the friend. So 50/50 makes sense. But the friend argues for three people, hence $30 each. \n\nThe author might have made a mistake by not considering that the friend would expect a third. But the author's logic was that they and their girlfriend are a unit, so two people. However, the friend might not see it that way. If the friend was just a third passenger, even if the author and girlfriend are a couple, the fair split would be three ways. But maybe the author thought the friend only benefited from the ride, so they should pay half. \n\nAnother angle: who initiated the ride? The author called the Uber. The friend was a passenger. If the author and their girlfriend would have taken the same ride without the friend, then the friend is just adding a passenger, so the cost should be split three ways. But if the friend's presence didn't affect the fare, then it's a matter of how they perceive splitting. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when you share a ride, it's common to split the cost based on the number of people. Since there were three people, splitting three ways is standard. The author's approach of grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one entity might not be the norm. Even though they live together, they are two individuals, but the friend is another. So splitting three ways is fair. The author's 50/50 split might be seen as unfair because the friend is only one person. \n\nThe author is now chasing the $15 difference, which could be seen as making a big deal out of a small amount. If the friend was okay with paying $30, the author is trying to collect $15 more. This could strain the friendship. The author's mistake was in how they calculated the split. If the author had split it three ways from the start, there wouldn't be an issue. So the author is in the wrong because the correct split would be three ways, not two. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
