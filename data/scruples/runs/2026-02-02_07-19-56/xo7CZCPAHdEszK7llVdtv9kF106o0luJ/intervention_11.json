This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about splitting an Uber fare. The author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The ride cost $90, and the author paid the full amount. Then they sent the friend $45, which is half the cost. The friend thought he should only pay a third, since there were three people. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong for making a fuss over $15.\n\nFirst, I should consider how the cost should be split. If there were three people, splitting equally would mean each pays a third. So $90 divided by three is $30 each. But the author split it 50/50, meaning they considered themselves as one entity (the couple) and the friend as another. So the couple paid half, and the friend paid half. That would make the friend pay $45. But the friend argues it should be $30. The author is now trying to get $15 from the friend, which is the difference between 50/50 and 1/3 split.\n\nWait, the author paid the full $90 and then sent the friend $45. So the author is asking the friend to pay half. The friend thinks they should pay a third. The author is now trying to get the $15 difference. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key here is about the initial agreement. The author didn't discuss splitting the fare beforehand. If the author assumed they'd split 50/50, but the friend thought it should be 1/3, then maybe the author's approach was wrong. Because when you have three people, splitting it into two groups (couple and friend) isn't logical. Normally, splitting among three would mean each pays a third. The author might have made an assumption without checking with the friend, leading to a misunderstanding. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they usually split things 50/50 with their girlfriend, but that's between two people. Adding a third person without clarifying how to split could be the problem. The friend might feel it's unfair to pay half when there are three of them. The author is now trying to get the $15, which is a small amount, but the conflict has caused strain in the friendship. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not clarifying the split beforehand and then insisting on their own method after the fact. Since the friend didn't agree, the author is pushing to get the $15, which the friend doesn't think is necessary. The author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate properly and are now making a big deal over a small amount that caused a rift. The correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
