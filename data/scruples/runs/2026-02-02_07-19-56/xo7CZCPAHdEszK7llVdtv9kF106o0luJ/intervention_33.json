This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber fare. The author paid $90 for an Uber that included three people: themselves, their girlfriend, and a friend. The author then asked the friend to pay $45 (half), but the friend thinks it should be $30 (a third). The author is now wondering if they're at fault for making a big deal out of $15.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if splitting 50/50 is fair when three people are involved. Normally, if three people share a ride, the fair split would be one-third each. But the author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses, so they're counting as one entity. That's an interesting point. If the girlfriend and the author always split costs, maybe combining them makes sense. But the friend might not be aware of their arrangement and expects each person to pay their share. \n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author should consider the friend's perspective. The author called the Uber and paid for it, then sent a request for half. The friend thinks it should be a third. The author is now stuck because the friend isn't paying up and the friendship is strained. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong here. Even though they and their girlfriend live together, when inviting a friend, it's standard to split the cost based on the number of people involved. The friend could reasonably expect that since there were three people, each should pay a third. The author's approach of treating themselves and the girlfriend as one entity might be fair between the two of them, but when a third party is involved, that third party would likely expect a different split. \n\nAlso, the friend might feel that the author is taking advantage by charging half instead of a third. The author's reasoning is logical in their own context, but the friend's expectation is based on the number of people present. The author didn't clarify this before the ride, leading to a misunderstanding. \n\nIn similar situations, people often expect equal sharing unless otherwise agreed. So, the author's insistence on 50/50, especially for a one-time expense, might come off as being overly focused on a small amount and not considering the friend's viewpoint. The $15 difference is significant in the context of the friendship. The author might be right in their own logic, but the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate, leading the friend to feel pressured. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
