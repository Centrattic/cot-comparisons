This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend, who live together, picked up a friend on the way to the airport. The total fare was $90, and the author paid the full amount and then tried to get the friend to pay half. The friend thinks it should be a third each.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is how to fairly split the cost. The author argues that since they and their girlfriend are a couple, they should be considered one entity, hence splitting with the friend as two entities. The friend argues that it should be three people, so each pays a third. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting costs among multiple people usually depends on who is benefiting from the shared ride. The friend was only along for part of the trip, getting dropped off at the airport before the author and girlfriend. If the friend was only riding a portion of the way, maybe his share should be based on the distance he traveled. However, the description says the friend lives in the direction of the airport and was picked up en route, so maybe the entire ride includes his part. \n\nBut in many cases, when someone joins a ride to the airport, especially when the ride is going that way anyway, the cost is split based on the number of people. The author and girlfriend might have considered themselves as one since they live together, but in reality, the Uber fare is typically split per person unless otherwise arranged. If the friend was a third passenger, then each should pay a third. \n\nThe author's approach of splitting 50/50 assumes their two people as a single entity, which might not be the standard practice. The friend's expectation of a third is more about equal sharing among all three, regardless of their relationship. Since the author took the initiative to arrange the ride, maybe they should have discussed the split beforehand. \n\nThe author is now trying to collect $45 from the friend, but the friend isn't willing to pay more than $30. The author is holding onto the situation, which could be seen as making a big deal over $15. However, if the author didn't plan for splitting the cost, maybe they were in the wrong. But the friend also didn't contribute initially and is now avoiding the discussion. \n\nIn summary, the main point is whether splitting costs should be based on the number of individuals or the number of entities. Since the friend was a separate person, the correct split would be three parts. The author's 50/50 approach might be the issue here. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not splitting it into three. But maybe the friend is being unreasonable for not contributing anything. However, the standard is usually per person, so the author might have miscalculated. Hence, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
