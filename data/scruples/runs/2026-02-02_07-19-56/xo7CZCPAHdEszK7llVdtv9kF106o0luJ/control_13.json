This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when three people were in the ride. The situation involves the author and their girlfriend splitting the cost with a friend, but the friend thinks it should be a third each instead of half. The author sent a request for $45 (half of $90) to their friend, but the friend argues it should be $30 (a third). The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard for splitting costs in shared rides. Typically, when multiple people share a ride, the cost is divided equally among all passengers. So with three people, each should pay a third. The author's reasoning was that they and their girlfriend are one entity, hence splitting 50/50 with the friend. But that's where the problem arises. The friend likely expected each individual to pay, not the couple as a unit. The author's approach might be seen as grouping themselves and their girlfriend together, which isn't standard practice in such situations. \n\nNext, the amount in question is $15. It's a small sum, but the author is holding onto it, which is causing a rift in the friendship. The friend might feel that the author is overreacting, especially since the money is minimal. However, if the author is consistent in splitting costs this way, maybe they have a point. But the main issue is the initial split. The standard practice is to split by the number of people, not by couples or households. So splitting into two entities (couple vs. friend) isn't fair to the third person. \n\nThe author's argument that they usually split everything and it balances out might not apply here. The friend was an additional person, so expecting them to pay half is incorrect because the total number is three. Therefore, the author is grouping themselves as one, leading to an unequal distribution. The friend is correct in pointing out that each person should pay a third. The author's insistence on the $15 difference is making a big deal out of a small amount, which could strain the friendship unnecessarily. The key point is whether the split was fair at the time. Since the standard is per person, the author is in the wrong for not splitting into three parts. Even though the amount is small, the principle of fairness is important. The author should have accounted for three people and adjusted their request accordingly. Hence, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
