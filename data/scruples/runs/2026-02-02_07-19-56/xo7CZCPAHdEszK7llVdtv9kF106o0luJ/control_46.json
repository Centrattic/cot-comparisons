This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend even though there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly. They picked up a friend on the way to the airport, and the Uber was $90. The author paid the full amount and then sent a request for $45 to the friend, considering that they (the author and girlfriend) should be considered one entity, hence splitting the cost 50/50. The friend argued that it should be split three ways instead.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong in charging $45 instead of $30 (which would be a third). The author's reasoning is that they're a couple and usually split costs 50/50, so treating them as one entity makes sense. The friend thought it should be three people sharing the cost. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, when multiple people share a ride, the cost is split among all passengers. However, in this case, the author and girlfriend are a couple who already split costs between themselves. If they usually split expenses 50/50, then perhaps they should have considered their shared expenses and how splitting with the friend would work. But the friend might have expected a three-way split because there were three people. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Did the author and friend clarify how the cost would be split before the ride? If not, the author might have assumed their usual method, but the friend had a different expectation. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't discuss it beforehand. However, the friend might also be in the wrong for expecting a different split without discussion.\n\nAlso, the amount in question is $15, which is relatively small. The author is making a big deal out of it, which could be seen as unnecessary if the friend is being unreasonable. But if the author's approach is consistent with how they handle expenses, maybe they're not wrong. \n\nIn many cases, when you have a group ride, the standard is to split by the number of people. The author's approach of grouping themselves and the girlfriend as one entity might not be the norm. So expecting the friend to pay half might be seen as unfair, as the friend was just one of three people. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't split the cost among all three passengers, even though they are a couple. The friend's expectation of a three-way split is more aligned with typical sharing practices. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't split the cost proportionally based on the number of people using the ride.\n"
