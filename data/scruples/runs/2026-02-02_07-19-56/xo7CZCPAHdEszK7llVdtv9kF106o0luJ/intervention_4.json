This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend (who live together) took an Uber to the airport and picked up a friend along the way. The total was $90, so the author paid and then tried to get the friend to pay half. The friend thought it should be one-third. The author is questioning if they were wrong to make a big deal about the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the fairness of splitting costs. Typically, when sharing a ride, the cost is divided by the number of people. Since there were three people, each should pay a third. The author and their girlfriend live together, so maybe they considered themselves as one unit, hence splitting the cost into two shares. But that's not the usual practice. Usually, each person's share is based on the number of people, not how they live.\n\nThe author split it 50/50, which would mean each of the three pays $30, but the friend was being asked to pay $45, which is half of $90. Wait, no\u2014the total was $90, and the author paid it all, then tried to get $45 from the friend. That would mean the author and girlfriend paid $45 total, so each of them would pay $22.50. But the author is asking the friend to pay half, which is $45. That's actually a 2/3 split, since the friend is paying half of the total fare, which is more than their share if divided equally among three. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, there are three people total. The ride cost $90. If each person pays equally, each should pay $30. The author paid the full $90, then asked the friend to pay $45. That would mean the author and their girlfriend are paying $45 total, so each of them would pay $22.50. The friend is paying $45. So the friend ends up paying more than their fair share. That seems unfair. The correct split would be $30 each. So the author is effectively making the friend pay $15 more than their share. That's why the friend is upset. The author thinks splitting between two entities (themselves and the friend) is fair, but the friend thinks it should be three people. The author is in the wrong here because the fair split would be each person paying a third. The author overcharged the friend by $15. So the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
