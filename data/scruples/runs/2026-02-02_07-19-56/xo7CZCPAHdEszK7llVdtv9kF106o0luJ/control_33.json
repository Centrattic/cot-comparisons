This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 among three people.\n\nSo the situation is that the author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The ride cost $90, and the author paid it all. Then they tried to split the cost 50/50 between their group (themselves and the girlfriend as one entity) and the friend. That would mean the friend pays $45, which is half of $90. But the friend thought it should be split three ways, so each person pays $30. The friend is upset because they feel they should only pay a third, while the author thinks since they live together, they count as one person, hence splitting 50/50 with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if splitting it 50/50 is fair. The key here is how the cost is divided. The author and their girlfriend live together and might usually split expenses between them, but in this case, they were going to the airport together. The friend was picked up along the way and probably only used part of the ride. However, the author is treating their own two-person group as one entity, hence splitting the total between two entities (their group and the friend). That logic might not sit well with the friend because it ignores the fact that there were three individuals, each benefiting from the ride. \n\nIn many situations, when multiple people are sharing a ride, the standard is to split the cost equally per person. If the author and girlfriend are considered two people, and the friend is one, then splitting three ways would be fair. But the author grouped themselves into one entity, which might be a miscalculation. Also, the friend might feel that the author is not accounting for the fact that they only used part of the ride, but the author didn't mention that the friend rode part of the way. Wait, the description says the friend was picked up on the way to the airport, so maybe he only used a portion of the ride. If the total cost was $90, but the friend only used part of it, then the cost should be split based on the distance each person traveled. However, the author didn't mention that. They just split it 50/50. \n\nSo, if the friend was only using part of the ride, then charging him half of the total might be unfair. But the author didn't account for that. However, in the scenario, the author says the friend was picked up on the way, so maybe the friend was traveling the entire distance. Wait, the user says the friend was picked up a mile or two away from them, in the direction of the airport. So the Uber was going from their location to the airport, and the friend was picked up along the way. So the friend's portion of the ride might be less than the full distance. But the author didn't consider that. If the author paid the full fare, then the friend's share would be based on how much of the ride he used. However, the author just split it 50/50, perhaps assuming that the friend was using the entire ride. \n\nBut the problem here is that the author grouped themselves (two people) as one entity, which might not be correct. Normally, each individual is considered a separate entity. If there are three people in the Uber, each person should pay a third. The author's mistake was in grouping themselves as one person when they are two individuals. So if they consider themselves as two people, plus the friend as one, then splitting the cost into three equal parts would be fair. The author's approach of splitting into two entities (themselves as one and the friend as another) leads to the friend paying half, which is more than a third. That's where the friend is coming from. \n\nSo, the friend is correct in thinking that each person should pay a third. The author's method is incorrect because they didn't count themselves and their girlfriend as two separate individuals. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they miscalculated the split. The $15 difference is significant in this context because splitting three ways would mean the friend pays $30, not $45. The author's insistence on the $15 is making a big deal out of it, but the root issue is their miscalculation. \n\nHowever, another angle: sometimes when people share a ride, especially when one person is giving a ride to another, they might not split the cost equally. For example, if someone drives another person, the driver might cover the cost of the passenger. But in this case, all three are sharing an Uber, so it's a shared ride. The standard practice is to split the cost equally. The author's approach of grouping themselves as one entity is unconventional. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't split the cost into three equal parts. The friend is right to expect a 1/3 share. The $15 is the difference between half and a third. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). But wait, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15. The author is in the wrong for miscalculating the split, but the question is about the act of making a big deal out of it. The author is insisting on the $15, which is the result of their miscalculation. So the author is in the wrong for both the calculation and the insistence on the $15. However, the question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15. \n\nBut the root issue is the calculation. The author's error led to the $15 dispute. So the author is in the wrong because they shouldn't have insisted on the 50/50 split. The friend is correct to expect a 1/3 share. Therefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
