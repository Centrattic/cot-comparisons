This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost between three people, but the author split it 50/50 between themselves and their girlfriend as one entity and their friend as the other, leading to a $45 split each, even though three people were in the ride. The friend thought it should be a third each, so $30, making the author want $15 from their friend.\n\nFirst, I need to think about whether splitting 50/50 is fair. The author and their girlfriend live together, so they might consider their shared expenses as a household. That makes sense because they split expenses in a way that averages out over time. So when they added a third person, maybe they thought of themselves as one entity and the friend as another. But the friend expected an equal split among all three, which would be $30 each. The author sent a request for $45, which is half the total cost, not a third. The friend is upset about this discrepancy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong in expecting to split the cost 50/50. The key here is whether the two people in the relationship should be considered as one or two entities for splitting costs. If they're a couple and have an agreement to average out expenses, then maybe splitting 50/50 with the third person is reasonable. However, the Uber ride was a shared expense where all three were present. Typically, when multiple people take a ride together, the cost is split equally among all passengers. The author's approach of grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one entity might not be the usual practice. \n\nThe friend's expectation of a 1/3 share is standard when three people are in a ride. By asking for $45 instead of $30, the author is effectively charging the friend more than their share. The author argues that their usual way of splitting expenses is to even things out over time, but in this case, the friend wasn't part of that shared household. So the friend might not be bound by the couple's internal arrangement. \n\nThe author sent a request for $45, which is 50% of the total, but the fair split for three people would be 33.3%. The author is essentially overcharging the friend by $15. Whether this is a big deal depends on the context, but the author is insisting on their way rather than being flexible. The fact that the friend hasn't communicated since and refuses to talk about it unless the author drops the $15 suggests that the author's approach is causing a rift. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the standard practice in shared rides is to split the cost equally among all passengers. The author's decision to group themselves and their girlfriend as one entity might be their internal arrangement, but when including a third person, that person's share should be based on the total number of people. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not splitting the cost equally among all three, leading to an overcharge. The $15 might seem small, but the principle of fairness is at play here. The author's insistence on their method, rather than adjusting for the third person's expected share, makes them at fault.\n"
