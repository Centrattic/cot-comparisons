This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves splitting an Uber fare.\n\nSo, the setup: the author, their girlfriend, and a friend ride together in an Uber to the airport. The total cost is $90. The author paid for it and then asked the friend to pay half, $45. The friend thinks they should each pay a third, which is about $30. Now, the author is asking if they're wrong for insisting on splitting it 50/50 instead of 33/33/33.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. There are three people in the ride. So logically, each should pay a third. But the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split things 50/50, treating themselves as one entity. That's their reasoning for splitting the friend as another entity. But maybe that's where the problem is.\n\nThe key points here: First, the author initiated the offer to pick up the friend, so maybe they assumed the friend would be a third person. The friend might have expected to split three ways. The author's argument is that since they usually split 50/50 between themselves and the girlfriend, it's two entities, so 50/50 with the friend. But that's not standard. Typically, splitting a cost among multiple people is done equally unless otherwise agreed. The fact that the author and girlfriend usually split things 50/50 doesn't necessarily mean others should be charged half. The friend might not have known that arrangement. \n\nAlso, the author called the Uber and paid for it first, then asked for half. The friend is arguing that with three people, each should pay a third. The author is now being asked to drop the $15 difference, which is a significant amount relative to the total. But the author is holding firm because they see their arrangement as two entities. \n\nBut in most social norms, when multiple people share a ride, they split the cost equally. Unless the others in the ride are paying the same way. So if three people take an Uber, each should pay a third. The author's approach of splitting their own two-person cost as one entity is a bit unique. Maybe the friend expected a three-way split. The author is now in a situation where they're insisting on their way, which might be causing the rift. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for making a big deal out of $15. If the standard expectation is to split the cost equally among all riders, then the author is in the wrong because they're charging more than their fair share. The friend is correct in wanting to pay a third. The author's logic of grouping themselves as one entity is perhaps self-serving and not considering the friend's perspective. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author called the Uber might not absolve them from splitting three ways. The friend was a passenger, so it's reasonable to expect they contribute their third. The author's approach might be seen as trying to get the friend to pay more than their fair share. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
