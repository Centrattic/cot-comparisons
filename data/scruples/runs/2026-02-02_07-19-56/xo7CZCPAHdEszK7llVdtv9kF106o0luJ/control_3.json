This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost between three people. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, but in this case, they grouped themselves as one entity, so splitting 50/50 with their friend. The friend thinks it should be a third each instead, and now the author is trying to get $45 from them but the friend only wants to pay around $30.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around splitting costs. When multiple people are sharing a ride, typically the cost is divided by the number of people. So three people would each pay a third. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as a single paying unit, which might be their usual arrangement, but when inviting a friend into the situation, the expectation might be that each person pays a third. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they and their girlfriend usually split things 50/50, they considered themselves as one unit, making it two units (them and the friend). So 50/50 between the two units. But the friend sees it as three individuals, hence a third each. The friend's perspective is more about the actual number of people sharing the ride. \n\nThe key point here is fairness. If the author and their girlfriend are considered two people, then splitting the cost among three would mean each person pays approximately $30. However, the author is charging $45 to the friend, which is half the total, implying that their combined unit is paying $45. That's actually $22.50 each for the author and their girlfriend, which is less than the friend would pay if it were a third. Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The total is $90. If it's split into three, each pays $30. If the author and girlfriend are considered one unit, then two units: $90 divided by two is $45 each. So the author's unit pays $45 (which they split 50/50 between themselves), and the friend pays $45. But the friend thinks they should only pay $30. The author is trying to get $45 from the friend, but the friend is only willing to pay $30, leading to a $15 difference. \n\nSo the author is charging the friend half the total, which is $45, but the friend thinks it's $30. The issue is whether the author is in the wrong by charging $45. From a standard perspective, when three people share a ride, each should pay a third. The author's approach of grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one unit might be their own arrangement, but when including a third person, the usual practice is to split three ways. Therefore, the author is asking the friend to pay more than their fair share. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider that the third person should pay a third. The $15 might seem small, but the error in calculation is on the author's side. The correct split would be $30 each, so the author is overcharging the friend. Hence, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
