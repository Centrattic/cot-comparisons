This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The situation involves the author, their girlfriend, and a friend. The author paid the full $90 Uber ride and then asked the friend for $45, which is half. The friend thinks it should be a third each, so $30. The author is wondering if they're being unreasonable by holding out for $45 instead of dropping it for $15.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The three people are sharing an Uber. The author's girlfriend lives with them, so maybe they usually split expenses between them. But in this case, they had a friend joining them who only lived a mile or two away but in the direction of the airport. So the author picked up the friend on the way to the airport. The ride cost $90. The author paid for it and then sent the friend a request for $45, which is half. The friend argues that since there are three people, it should be $30 each. The author is holding out for $45, and the friend is refusing to talk about it unless the author drops the $15 difference.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The author and their girlfriend are considered as one entity, and the friend as another. But the friend's argument is that there are three people, hence a third share. So who is right?\n\nIf you consider that all three people are using the Uber, then splitting the cost equally would be $30 each. However, the author's reasoning is that since the girlfriend doesn't pay their share usually, they act as a single entity. So the author and girlfriend are splitting the cost among their own, and the friend is the other entity. But that might not be the case. The friend might have expected to split it three ways because they were all riding together. \n\nAnother angle is the convenience. The author's friend was picked up on the way to the airport, which the author mentions the friend lives a mile or two away. So the friend's ride to the airport is part of the same trip that the author and girlfriend would have taken anyway? Maybe the original ride was for the author and girlfriend, and the friend is just a lift. In that case, the friend's share might be lower because they didn't add much to the cost. But the Uber fare is $90 total. So the question is, how much did each person contribute to the fare?\n\nIf the original ride without the friend would have cost a certain amount, and adding the friend increased the cost. But since Uber charges based on distance and time, the total fare is $90. The friend is being picked up on the way, so maybe the friend's addition didn't significantly increase the cost beyond what the author and girlfriend would have paid. However, the author paid the full $90, so they might consider that the friend should pay for their portion of the ride. \n\nBut splitting 50/50 between the author's side (author and girlfriend) and the friend's side might not be fair if the ride was primarily for the author and girlfriend. However, the friend was a third person using the service. \n\nIn typical sharing scenarios, if three people split a ride, each would pay a third. But maybe the author's assumption that they and their girlfriend are a single unit is what's causing the confusion. If the author and girlfriend are in a committed relationship, they might not usually split expenses, so the friend might not have known that. The author sent the friend $45, which is half, expecting the friend to cover half the cost. The friend thinks it should be $30. \n\nThe issue is that the author is holding out for $45 instead of accepting $30, which could be seen as being petty over $15. The friend is refusing to talk about it unless the author drops the $15. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, splitting three ways would be $30 each. The author's approach of splitting 50/50 between two entities (author/gf and friend) is perhaps not considering that the friend is an individual user. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for charging half instead of a third. However, if the author and girlfriend usually don't split expenses, maybe the author isn't wrong to consider them as one entity. But the problem is that the friend might not have been aware of that arrangement and expected an equal split among all three. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when you have multiple people in a ride, it's usually split equally unless otherwise agreed. The author didn't communicate with the friend beforehand about splitting the cost, so the friend might have expected to split three ways. The author's approach of charging half seems to be the issue here. The $15 difference is small, but the author is making a big deal about it, which could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because charging half instead of a third is unfair when there are three people. The correct split would be $30 each. The author's insistence on $45 is unreasonable and causing a rift in the friendship over a small amount. Hence, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
