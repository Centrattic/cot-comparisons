This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 with two other people. The situation is that there were three people: the author and his girlfriend, who live together, and a friend. The Uber cost $90, and the author split it 50/50, meaning the friend paid $45, but the friend thinks he should have paid 1/3, which is $30. The author is now wondering if he's wrong for insisting on the $45 split, leading to a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The author and his girlfriend are a couple living together, and they picked up their friend on the way to the airport. The author called the Uber, paid for it, and then tried to split the cost. The key point is whether splitting it as two entities (author/gf as one, friend as another) is fair or if it should be split as three separate people.\n\nIn many cases, when splitting costs among multiple people, each person is considered an individual unless they're a couple or a group that typically shares expenses. However, here the author and his girlfriend might be considered a single entity since they live together and split expenses evenly. So, if there are two entities (the couple and the friend), splitting 50/50 between them would mean each entity pays half. That would be $45 for the couple and $45 for the friend. But the friend argues it should be 1/3 each, which would be $30 per person. Wait, but there are three people. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating here.\n\nWait, the total is $90. If you split it three ways, each person pays $30. But the author and his girlfriend are a couple, so maybe it's considered two entities. So splitting two ways would be $45 each. The friend is one entity, so he pays $45. But the friend thinks he should pay $30. So the author is charging $45 instead of $30, a $15 difference. So the question is, is the author wrong for charging $45 instead of $30?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he and his girlfriend are a single unit (because they split expenses among themselves anyway), splitting with the friend is 50/50 between two entities. The friend's reasoning is that there are three people, so each should pay 1/3. The problem is the ambiguity in how to count the entities. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the ride was shared by three people, each person should contribute an equal share, so $30 each. However, the author and his girlfriend are a couple who share expenses, so maybe they should split the cost between them first and then consider the friend. But in this case, the author paid the entire $90 and then tried to split with the friend. If the friend was a third person, the fair split would be $30 each. But the author grouped himself and his girlfriend as one, leading to a 50/50 split. \n\nAnother angle: when people share a ride, the standard is to split the cost based on the number of people. So three people, each pays 1/3. However, if two people are a couple and they usually split everything 50/50, maybe they consider their shared expenses as a single entity. But the friend might not be aware of that and expects everyone to split equally. The author's approach might not consider the friend's perspective, leading to a misunderstanding. \n\nThe author's mistake could be not clarifying beforehand how the split would work. Since the friend expected 1/3, but the author charged 50%, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the standard three-way split. Alternatively, if the couple's agreement is to count as a single entity, then maybe the split is correct. But in shared rides, the norm is per person. So maybe the author should have split it three ways. \n\nThe amount in question is $15, which is relatively small. However, the issue is about fairness. If the friend thinks it should be $30, but the author charged $45, the author might be seen as being strict about a minor amount, causing a rift in the friendship. The key here is whether the author's reasoning is valid. If the couple is considered one entity, then 50/50 makes sense, but if the friend is another person, then three ways would be fair. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the standard practice for shared rides is to split per person, not per couple. The author's approach could be seen as unfair to the friend. However, some might argue that couples can have different arrangements. But given the context, the author's approach could be considered unfair, leading to the friend refusing to pay the $15. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the fair split is per person, not per couple.\n"
