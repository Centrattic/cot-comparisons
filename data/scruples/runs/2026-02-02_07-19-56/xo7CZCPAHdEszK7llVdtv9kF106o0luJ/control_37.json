This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber fare.\n\nSo, the setup: The author, their girlfriend, and a friend all took an Uber to the airport. The total cost was $90. The author paid and then tried to split it 50/50 between themselves (as a couple) and the friend. The friend thought it should be split three ways, hence $30 each. The author is now upset because the friend isn't paying, and they haven't spoken since. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making a big deal over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around splitting costs. Typically, when multiple people take a ride, the cost is divided by the number of people. In this case, there are three individuals: the author, the girlfriend, and the friend. So splitting it into three equal parts would be $30 each. However, the author considered themselves and the girlfriend as one entity, so splitting two ways. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe key point is whether the author and girlfriend should be considered as one person for the purpose of splitting the fare. If they usually split expenses 50/50 between themselves, maybe they see their expenses as a shared responsibility. But when it comes to someone else, the friend might expect each individual to contribute. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the ride was shared by three people, the standard approach is to divide by three. The author's approach of splitting into two (assuming the couple is one) could be seen as unfair to the friend, who is paying more than their share. The friend's objection is valid because they are essentially paying for two-thirds of the ride when there are three people. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that since they and the girlfriend usually split things 50/50, they're grouping their expenses. But this might not be the friend's perspective. The friend might not be aware of their internal arrangement and expects each person present to pay equally. \n\nThen there's the issue of the author sending a request for $45. That's a direct ask, which might come off as abrupt or not considering the friend's expectation. The friend's refusal to pay $15 more than the 1/3 share could be because they feel the author is being unreasonable. \n\nThe author is making a big deal out of $15, but in the context of a $90 total, it's a significant portion (16.6%). The friend's stance is that they should pay $30, not $45. The author's insistence might be seen as being inflexible, especially if the friend is unwilling to discuss it further. \n\nIn social situations, flexibility and communication are key. The author might have assumed their method was fair, but the friend's perspective is different. The fact that the author is holding onto the $15 and it's affecting their friendship suggests that the author might be overreacting, especially if the amount isn't that significant in the grand scheme. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong by not considering the friend's expectation of splitting three ways and by making a big deal out of a relatively small amount, which is causing a rift in the friendship.\n"
