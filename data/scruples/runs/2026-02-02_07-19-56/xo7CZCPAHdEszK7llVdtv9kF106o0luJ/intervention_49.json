This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend called an Uber to the airport, picked up a friend along the way, and the total cost was $90. The author paid and then asked their friend to pay half, which is $45, instead of a third ($30). The friend is upset about the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses, but they consider themselves as one entity here. The friend was picked up because he was going in the same direction. The question is whether splitting 50/50 is fair when there are three people involved.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting equally among three would mean each pays a third. However, the author and their girlfriend might think that since they live together and the friend is just a third person, they should split as two people (them) vs. one (the friend). That's a common way people handle shared expenses with couples or roommates. So, if the author called the Uber and picked up the friend, the ride would cost less if they had gone alone. Adding the third person might not have increased the total cost proportionally. For example, if the Uber was a shared ride or if the route was efficient, the total might not triple. So the friend might be paying for the convenience of the ride, not the full cost of the ride. \n\nBut in this case, the total was $90. If the author had taken two Ubers, it would have been more expensive, so combining with the friend actually saved money. So maybe the original cost is split based on how much each person benefited. The friend is only in the car for part of the ride, so maybe their share should be less. However, the author didn't calculate the exact distance each person traveled. They just split 50/50 between the two people (author and girlfriend) and the friend. \n\nThe problem arises because the author's friend expected a third. So the disagreement is about the fairness of the split. The author might think that since they were two people and the friend was one, splitting as two vs. one is fair. The friend thinks it should be three equal parts. The author is pushing for half, which is $45, while a third is $30. The difference is $15. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the friend was a third of the total cost, then the author is being unreasonable by not splitting it that way. However, if the ride was more efficiently shared (like the friend's portion didn't significantly increase the cost), then maybe the split should be different. But since the author didn't account for that, maybe they overcharged the friend. \n\nIn many cases, when splitting costs, people consider the number of people sharing the expense. So if three people are using the same Uber, it's fair to split it three ways. The author's reasoning of grouping themselves as one entity (since they live together) might not be as common, but it's not unheard of. However, if the friend expected a third, the author's insistence on 50/50 could be seen as unfair, especially since the friend was just a third person. \n\nThe author is making a big deal out of $15, which is a small amount, but their insistence on keeping the money is causing a rift. The friend might feel that the author is being petty. So in terms of who is in the wrong, the author might be at fault for not considering the three-way split and for not letting go of $15 to preserve the friendship. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
