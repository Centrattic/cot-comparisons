This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 among three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend called an Uber, picked up a friend, and then tried to split the $90 fare 50/50, meaning the friend pays half. The friend thinks it should be a third each.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly. So when they picked up the friend, they considered themselves as one entity (so they pay half) and the friend as another (paying the other half). The friend, however, argues that since there were three people, it should be a third each. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong for pushing the $15 difference.\n\nThe main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Number of people sharing the cost**: The ride included three people. If it's a shared ride, typically the cost should be split among all passengers. So each person should pay 1/3 of $90, which is about $30 each. The author is charging the friend $45, which is half, while they themselves paid $90 initially but expected to get $45 back from the friend. Wait, actually, the author paid for the ride and then sent a request for $45 (half) to the friend. But if there are three people, each should pay $30. So the author and their girlfriend would cover $60 total, and the friend $30. However, since they live together and split expenses, they might consider their combined share as one third each? Wait, no. The original setup is that the author and girlfriend are considered as one entity (so they split the cost with the friend). But that's not typical. Usually, each individual passenger splits the cost. So three people, each pays a third. So the friend should pay $30, not $45. Therefore, the author is overcharging the friend by $15. So the author is in the wrong because they're charging the friend half when it should be a third. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author and their girlfriend are considered as one because they live together. But even if they share expenses, when it comes to splitting with others, it's standard to split per person. For example, if you have a ride with three people, each pays a third. So if the friend is one person, and the author and girlfriend are two people, the friend should pay a third. The author and girlfriend split their combined share (two-thirds), meaning each pays a third. But the author is charging the friend half, which is incorrect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they are not accounting for the three people in the ride. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning of \"we count as one entity\" is flawed because in terms of shared costs, each individual typically splits based on the number of people. Unless it's a business trip or some arrangement where a group is considered a single entity. But in a personal ride, each person is responsible for their own share. Therefore, the author's approach is incorrect, making them at fault. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
