This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. So the situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together, and they picked up a friend on the way to the airport. The total fare was $90, and the author paid and then asked the friend to split it equally, 50/50. But the friend thought it should be divided into thirds since there were three people. The friend hasn't responded since and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider fairness. The author called the Uber, so maybe they took the initiative, but the friend was a third person benefitting from the ride. The author and their girlfriend might be considered as a group, but the friend was a separate person. So splitting 50/55 (group vs friend) might be one approach. But the author's logic was to split as two groups: two people (the couple) vs one person (friend). But the friend thought it should be three people. \n\nIn terms of fairness, when multiple people use a service, the cost is typically split based on the number of users. The friend was a third person, so splitting into thirds would be fair. The author's approach of splitting 50/50 between the group and the friend might not consider that the friend is an individual. The author's reasoning that they're a single entity (the couple) might be valid if they usually split expenses among themselves, but in this case, the third person wasn't part of their usual group. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for the third person's share. The friend's perspective is that each person should pay a third, which is more equitable since all three benefited. The author's approach leads to the friend paying more than their fair share if they're splitting per person. Therefore, the author is incorrect in their calculation. \n\nThe fact that the author is holding a $15 difference and not letting it go might also be an issue. Maybe the friend is stressed about the small amount, and the author is being rigid. The author's insistence on the $15 could be what's causing the rift. So in terms of being in the wrong, the author's initial split was unfair, and the subsequent insistence on the exact amount is exacerbating the problem.\n"
