This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend called an Uber to the airport, picked up a friend along the way, and then tried to split the $90 fare equally between the two of them (author and girlfriend as one, friend as the other). The friend thought it should be split three ways, leading to a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around splitting costs. Typically, if multiple people are sharing a ride, the cost is divided by the number of people. But the author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend live together and often split expenses 50/50, so they considered themselves as one entity. That's an interesting point. If they usually split their own expenses 50/50, maybe they see it as a single unit. However, bringing in a third person complicates things.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the friend should be charged 1/3. The author argues that since they and their girlfriend are a couple, they form a single paying unit. The friend, on the other hand, might argue that three people are using the same ride, so each should pay a third. The problem arises because the author didn't communicate this arrangement beforehand. If the friend wasn't aware that the author and their girlfriend usually split things 50/50, then the author might have set an expectation that wasn't clear.\n\nAlso, the amount in question is $15, which is relatively small. The author is holding onto the money request, and the friend is avoiding contact unless the author drops the $15. This suggests that the author's insistence might be causing more harm than the actual financial issue. In terms of social norms, making a big deal over a small amount can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the calculation is mathematically correct.\n\nAnother angle is that the author initiated the split, but perhaps didn't clarify the reasoning upfront. If the friend didn't agree to the 50/50 split in advance, then the author might be in the wrong for assuming that arrangement without consent. The author's approach of splitting as two entities (themself and their partner as one, the friend as the other) isn't standard practice. Usually, each person is considered an individual unless otherwise agreed.\n\nIn summary, while the author's calculation might be mathematically possible, the way they handled it\u2014without prior agreement and causing a rift over a small amount\u2014suggests they might be at fault. The friend's expectation of splitting three ways is more aligned with typical shared expense norms, so the author's insistence on a different split could be the issue here.\n"
