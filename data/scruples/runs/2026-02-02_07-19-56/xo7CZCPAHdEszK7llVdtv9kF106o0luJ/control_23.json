This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for splitting the Uber fare 50/50 between themselves and a friend, even though there were three people in the ride. The cost was $90, so the author paid $45 expecting the friend to pay half, but the friend thinks it should be a third each. The author is upset about a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs in shared situations typically works. If three people are sharing a ride, it's common to split the cost equally, which would be $30 each. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, splitting the total between two entities (the couple and the friend), hence 50/50. That's $45 each. The friend, however, expected a third, which would be $30. So the author is trying to collect $45 from the friend, while the friend thinks they should pay $30. The author is holding onto the $15 difference as a matter of principle, even though the friend doesn't want to discuss it unless the author drops the $15.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are fairness in splitting costs and the social dynamics involved. When you have a ride where three people are involved, even if two are a couple, the standard practice is to split the total by the number of people unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are a unit, so splitting between two units, but that's not a common approach. Typically, each individual is considered a separate entity in such splits. \n\nThe $15 might seem trivial, but the issue is about principle. However, the author is holding onto the money and not letting go of the disagreement, which is causing tension in the friendship. Friends often overlook minor financial differences for the sake of the relationship. By making a big deal out of $15, the author might be prioritizing the money over the friendship, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have communicated their expectation clearly. If the author had explained their reasoning (couple as one unit) upfront, maybe there would be less confusion. But since the friend expected a third, the author's approach might be seen as unfair. However, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting a split based on their own reasoning, but the problem arises in how they're handling the situation\u2014insisting on the $15 when it's causing a rift. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have some points, but the author might be more at fault for not considering the standard practice and for making it a point of contention. The $15 is a small amount, and the friendship's health is more important. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for overreacting and not compromising.\n"
