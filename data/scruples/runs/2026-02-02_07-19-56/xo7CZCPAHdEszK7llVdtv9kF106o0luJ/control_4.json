This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves splitting an Uber ride cost between three people.\n\nSo the author and their girlfriend live together and called an Uber to the airport. They picked up a friend along the way. The ride cost $90, and the author asked the friend to pay half ($45), reasoning that since they live together, they're considered one entity, making two entities total. The friend argued it should be one-third each, leading to a $15 difference. The author hasn't seen the friend since and can't discuss it unless they drop the $15.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are how the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity. Normally, when splitting costs among multiple people, each person is considered a separate entity. So if three people share a ride, each should pay a third. But the author grouped their girlfriend and themselves as one, so two entities, leading to a 50-50 split. That's the crux of the issue.\n\nBut if the friend didn't know beforehand that they were being considered as one group, then the author might be in the wrong. The friend probably expected that each individual person would split the cost equally. The author's approach was based on their own living arrangement, which might not be something the friend was aware of. The author took charge of the ride, so maybe they should have clarified the splitting method before the ride. Also, the $15 amount is relatively small, so making a big deal about it could be unnecessary, but the problem is about fairness in splitting the cost.\n\nAnother angle: the author paid the entire fare initially. Splitting the cost isn't about the method of payment but the fairness. If three people share a ride, each pays a third. By charging the friend half, the author is effectively making the friend pay more than their share. The author's justification is their living situation, but that doesn't change the fact that three people were using the ride. Unless the ride was specifically arranged for two people and the friend was just a detour, but the description says the friend lives in the direction of the airport, so probably the ride was a direct route with all three sharing. Therefore, the cost should be split equally. So the author is in the wrong for charging half instead of a third. The $15 is the difference between half and a third of $90, which is $45 vs $30. So the friend is being asked to pay $15 more than their fair share. Thus, the author is incorrect in their splitting method. Therefore, the answer would be AITA with answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
