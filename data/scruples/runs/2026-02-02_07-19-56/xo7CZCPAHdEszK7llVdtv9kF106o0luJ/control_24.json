This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting an Uber cost. The author and their girlfriend live together and were going to the airport during a busy time, which made the Uber expensive\u2014$90 total. They picked up a friend who was also going to the airport. The author paid the full amount and then tried to split the cost 50/50 with the friend, meaning the author and their girlfriend as one entity paying half, and the friend the other half. The friend thought it should be split three ways, which would be around $30 each. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for making a big deal over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual way such expenses are split. Typically, when multiple people are in a ride, the fair division is by the number of people. Since there were three people in the Uber, splitting it three ways would mean each pays a third. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, which might not be the standard approach. Friends usually split costs per person unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. However, the author and their girlfriend live together and often split expenses, but in this case, maybe they didn't plan to split with the friend. The friend might have expected to split the cost with all three, not just with the author and his girlfriend as a single unit.\n\nThe key points here are: the number of people involved, who initiated the ride, and prior agreements. The author called the Uber, so they might have assumed the cost would be shared equally, but the friend likely thought each person should pay their share. The $15 difference isn't huge, but it's causing a rift in the friendship. The author's approach of grouping themselves and their partner as one entity might be seen as unfair to the friend, especially since the friend didn't have a say in the arrangement. The friend's refusal to discuss unless the author drops the $15 suggests that the author's insistence is causing more harm than the amount itself. So, maybe the author is being too rigid about splitting it 50/50 and should consider the friend's perspective. The author could have discussed the split beforehand to avoid this issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the standard three-way split and for making a big deal out of a small amount, causing strain on the friendship.\n"
