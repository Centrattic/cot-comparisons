This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend (who live together) had a friend join their Uber to the airport. The total was $90, and the author paid and then asked the friend to split it 50/50, meaning the friend pays $45. But the friend thinks it should be a third each, about $30.\n\nHmm. The key point here is how to split the cost when there are three people. If it's three people, splitting equally would be $30 each. However, the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, hence splitting into two parts: their part and the friend's. That leads to 50/50, so each group pays $45. The author's reasoning is that they're a couple, so they act as a single unit, and the friend is another. But the friend probably thinks that since there are three people total, each should pay a third. \n\nThe author is in a bit of a gray area here. On one hand, they did offer to pick up the friend, and maybe they expected the friend to contribute for his own part of the ride. But the ride was to the airport, so the friend's portion of the trip might be shorter. Wait, the friend lives a mile or two away from them but in the direction of the airport. So maybe the friend's part of the ride is just a short distance, whereas the author and girlfriend are going all the way to the airport. So maybe the cost isn't exactly evenly split. The Uber fare might be based on distance and time. If the friend got picked up near the author's place, then his part of the ride is minimal, so maybe he should pay less. But the author didn't account for that and just split 50/50. \n\nBut the author's main mistake might be not clarifying the cost sharing beforehand. They could have agreed on splitting equally by the number of people. The author grouped themselves and the girlfriend as a single entity, which might not be fair to the friend. If there are three people, splitting it into three parts would be more equitable. The author is charging the friend half, which is more than his fair share if there are three people. The $15 difference is significant in this context. \n\nSo, the author's approach might be wrong because they didn't consider the actual usage. The friend's part of the ride is shorter, and splitting 50/50 might not reflect that. Also, grouping themselves as a couple could be seen as unfair. The author is in a position where they initiated the ride, so they might have some responsibility to cover the cost, especially if the friend's portion was minimal. The friend might feel it's unfair to pay 50% when his share is actually less. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the actual cost distribution and for not agreeing on terms before the ride. The answer is A.\n"
