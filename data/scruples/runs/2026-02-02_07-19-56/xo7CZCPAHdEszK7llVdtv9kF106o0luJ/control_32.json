This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost. So, there are three people involved: the author, his girlfriend, and a friend. The Uber cost $90, and the author split it 50/50 between them and their friend. The friend argues it should be a third each. The author is now wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the logic of splitting costs. If three people are sharing a ride, it's usually fair to split the cost equally, which would be $30 each. But the author and his girlfriend are living together, so maybe they consider themselves as one unit. That's a common practice when couples split expenses. So if they see themselves as one unit, then splitting 50/50 with the third person makes sense. The friend, however, might not have considered the couple as a single entity and expected each person to pay a third. \n\nThe author paid the Uber and then asked the friend for $45, which is half. The friend is upset because he thinks it should be $30. The author is now questioning if he's in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15. \n\nI think the key points here are: 1) The initial arrangement. Did they agree on how to split the costs? The story says they didn't discuss it beforehand. 2) The couple's living situation and existing habit of splitting expenses. If they usually split things 50/50 even though they live together, that might explain their approach. 3) Whether the friend was aware that the couple would be considered a single unit. \n\nSince there was no prior agreement, the author might have overstepped by expecting the friend to pay half. However, the couple's approach as a unit could be justified if they're used to splitting things that way. The friend's expectation of a third is also reasonable if he thought each person pays individually. \n\nIn terms of friendship impact, the $15 is not a huge amount, but the fact that the author is insisting on it might be causing tension. The friend might feel it's unnecessary to hold onto the money, especially if the total was split fairly. However, the author might feel that since he covered the entire cost, splitting 50/50 is fair given their usual habits. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because he was following their usual way of splitting expenses, but he could have considered the other person's perspective. However, the main issue is the lack of prior discussion. Since there was no agreement, both sides could have a point. But in most cases, splitting costs equally when there are three people is standard, so the author's approach of splitting 50/50 (treating the couple as one) might not be the norm. So maybe the author is in the wrong here because he didn't consider that the friend might expect an equal split among all three.\n"
