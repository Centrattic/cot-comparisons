This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The total cost was $90, and the author paid all of it. They offered to split the cost with their friend, but the author is splitting it 50/50, treating themselves and their girlfriend as one entity and the friend as another. The friend, however, thinks it should be split three ways, meaning each person pays $30. The author is now trying to get $45 from the friend, but the friend doesn't agree and the author is holding onto the $15 difference. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs typically works in such situations. When multiple people share a ride, the standard practice is to split the cost evenly among all participants. In this case, there are three people: the author, the girlfriend, and the friend. So the fair split would be $30 each. However, the author is treating themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity, which would mean splitting the cost into two parts. That approach might not be standard unless all parties agreed beforehand to that arrangement.\n\nThe key point here is whether splitting the cost between two entities (author/gf and friend) was communicated and agreed upon. The author mentions that usually, they split everything 50/50 between them and their girlfriend, but in this case, they didn't clarify with the friend about how the cost would be split. The friend's expectation was likely that all three would split the cost equally since there are three people. \n\nBy splitting 50/50 between two groups without prior agreement, the author is effectively charging the friend more than his share. The friend would end up paying $45 (half of $90) instead of $30 (one-third), which is a $15 difference. The author is now trying to get the friend to pay $45, which the friend refuses. The author is holding onto the $15, which might be causing tension in the friendship.\n\nAnother angle is the social context. When someone offers a ride to a friend, it's often implied that the cost is shared unless otherwise specified. The author initiated the arrangement, so they might be expected to either cover the cost themselves or split it three ways. Since the friend didn't agree to the 50/50 split beforehand, the author is imposing their own method of payment, which the friend finds unfair. \n\nThe author's reasoning that they and their girlfriend are a single entity might not be valid unless the friend knew and agreed to that. The author's approach could be seen as selfish because they're not considering the friend's perspective. The $15 might seem small, but the issue is about fairness and respect for the friend's contribution. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is in a position to have communicated the cost-splitting method before the ride. Since they didn't, the friend has a valid point in expecting an equal split. The author is now making a big deal about the $15, which could be unnecessary and straining the friendship. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because they didn't clarify the cost-splitting arrangement beforehand and are now enforcing a method that the friend finds unfair. The correct approach would have been to split the cost three ways, and the author's insistence on a 50/50 split without prior agreement is the root of the problem.\n"
