This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting an Uber fare. The author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The total cost was $90, and the author paid for it. Then they sent a request to their friend for $45, which is half of the total. The friend thought they should each pay a third, so $30 each. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for making a big deal out of $15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The three people are splitting the cost. The author called the Uber, so maybe they took the initiative, but does that mean they should pay more? Not necessarily. The friend was picked up along the way, so he was a third of the passengers. The author and girlfriend live together, so maybe they were going to take the Uber regardless, and the friend joined them. But if the friend's presence changed the cost, maybe he should pay a third. However, if the friend was just a short distance from the author and girlfriend's location, adding him might not have added much to the fare. Wait, the original fare was $90. If all three were in the same area, the Uber would have probably been similar to the original cost without the friend. But maybe the friend's location added a bit. The author might not have considered that the presence of a third person affects the cost.\n\nThen there's the argument about splitting 50/50 versus 1/3. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, so 50% each for two entities. The friend sees three individuals, so each pays 1/3. The key point here is whether the author and their girlfriend should be considered a single unit. If they live together and often split things evenly, maybe they see themselves as a single unit for cost-sharing. But in terms of fairness, if there are three people using the Uber, each person's share would be a third. The author's approach might be seen as unfair because it's three people splitting a cost, not two entities. \n\nBut maybe the author's reasoning is that since they were going to take the Uber anyway, the friend is adding a third person, so the friend should pay half of the cost they would have otherwise paid. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If the author and girlfriend were going alone, the cost would be $90. Adding a friend might not change the total cost significantly if the friend is just a short distance away. So maybe the friend should pay less than a third. However, if the Uber cost was $90 with all three, then each person should pay a third. Alternatively, if the Uber was the same cost as if it was just the author and girlfriend, but the friend was just a short detour, then the friend should pay less. The author might not have considered how much the friend's presence actually affected the fare.\n\nThe author's mistake might be in assuming that their combined entity (they and their girlfriend) should split the cost 50/50 with the friend, rather than each person paying a third. Since there are three people, the fair split would be $30 each. By charging $45, the author is taking more than their fair share. However, if the author and girlfriend are typically splitting costs 50/50 between themselves, maybe they see the total as their shared expense, hence splitting the total 50/50 with the friend. \n\nBut from the friend's perspective, it's three people, so each should pay a third. The author is charging half of the total fare to the friend, which could be seen as unfair. The $15 dispute is about $30 (friend pays $30 vs. $45). Wait, no, the total is $90. If the friend pays $45, that's half. The correct split would be $30 each. So the friend should pay $30, but the author is charging $45. That's a $15 difference. So the author is overcharging the friend by $15. That's the issue here. \n\nSo the author is in the wrong because they didn't calculate the fair share correctly. They considered themselves as one entity (hence two entities, leading to 50/50), but the friend is another entity. Therefore, three people, each paying a third. The author should have charged $30 instead of $45. Hence, the author is at fault for making the friend pay more than their fair share. The $15 difference is significant in the context of the total cost, so the author's approach was incorrect. The fact that they don't see the friend anymore suggests that the friend felt wronged, which aligns with the idea that the author was at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
