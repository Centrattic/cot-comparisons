This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for splitting an Uber cost 50/50 among three people. \n\nFirst, the situation: The Uber cost $90. The author and their girlfriend picked up a friend for the ride to the airport. The author paid the full amount and then tried to split the cost 50/50 with the friend, meaning each pays $45 instead of $30 each if split three ways. The friend is upset because they think it should be a third each. The author and girlfriend usually split expenses between themselves but not with others, hence treating themselves as one entity.\n\nThe main question is whether splitting the cost 50/50 between the couple and the friend (making two groups) is fair or if it should be three equal parts. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if all three were beneficiaries of the Uber ride, then technically it should be split three ways. However, the author and their girlfriend are already in a shared living situation and likely split expenses between themselves regularly. So treating them as a single entity (since they are a couple) and splitting the cost with the third person might be reasonable in their context. \n\nBut here's the catch: When you have a group of three people, unless there's a prior agreement that they're considered a single unit, the norm is usually to split the cost equally. The friend might feel it's unfair because they only rode along and didn't contribute equally to the planning or usage of the ride. The author might argue that the couple was responsible for organizing the ride and picking up the friend, so they should bear a larger share. However, since all three used the ride, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe author's approach might be seen as fair if they consider their own financial arrangement (as a couple) and how the third person benefited. But the friend's perspective is also valid if they feel the cost should be divided equally among all three users. The $15 difference is small, but the issue might be more about principle. \n\nConsidering common practices, splitting equally among all participants is the usual approach unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise. The author's decision to split 50/50 could be seen as inconsiderate to the friend's perspective. The fact that the friend hasn't wanted to discuss it further might indicate that the author's approach caused some friction. \n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely in the wrong if they have a justification for their split, the more standard approach is to split equally. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering the friend's expectation of a three-way split.\n"
