This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 between two people instead of three. The situation involves three people: the author and his girlfriend (who live together) and a friend. The Uber was $90, and the author paid the whole amount and then asked the friend for $45, splitting the cost 50/50. The friend thought it should be 1/3 each, so $30. The author is now wondering if he's in the wrong for the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs usually works. If three people are sharing a ride, the fair split would be each paying a third. But the author grouped himself and his girlfriend as one entity, so two entities in total. That's where the 50/50 split comes from. The key here is whether grouping with a live-in partner is reasonable. Since they live together and often split costs, maybe they consider themselves a single unit for expenses. However, the third person might not have agreed to that arrangement. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that all three are separate individuals, so each should pay a third. The author's reasoning is that he and his girlfriend already split expenses differently, so treating them as one makes sense. But the problem arises because the author didn't clarify this before the ride. The friend might not have been aware that the author and his girlfriend were splitting costs as a couple, leading to the conflict. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, maybe. He assumed that grouping himself and his girlfriend was acceptable, but the friend didn't agree. The author's approach might be based on their usual financial arrangement, but in a shared expense with others, it's important to communicate the terms beforehand. The author could have explained that he and his girlfriend usually handle expenses as a unit, so the friend would know to pay half instead of a third. However, the author did pay the entire fare and then asked for half, which the friend found unfair. \n\nThe $15 difference isn't a huge amount, but the issue is who should pay what. Legally or ethically, if all three used the ride equally, a third each is fair. But if the ride was primarily for the couple, and the friend was a passenger, the couple might bear more of the cost. However, the friend was also using the ride, so it's not clear if the cost should be split equally. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to split costs equally unless otherwise arranged. The author's mistake might be not discussing the split before the ride. The friend's refusal to talk about it unless the $15 is dropped suggests that the author is being overly rigid about the amount. The author might be right in thinking that he and his girlfriend are a unit, but in a group of three, that might not be the case. \n\nSo, the author could be in the wrong because he didn't set clear expectations beforehand. The friend's expectation was a third, and the author's approach of 50% without prior discussion caused the conflict. The author might have been too focused on his usual arrangement with his girlfriend, not considering the friend's perspective. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't clarify the split and imposed his own method without agreement.\n"
