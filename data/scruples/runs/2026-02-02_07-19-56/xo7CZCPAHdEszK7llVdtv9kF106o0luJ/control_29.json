This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The ride cost $90, and the author paid and then asked their friend to pay half, which is $45. The friend argues it should be a third each, so $30.\n\nHmm. So the question is about fairness in splitting costs. The author and girlfriend live together and usually split things evenly, so they considered themselves as one entity. But the friend is a third person. The problem here is that the author paid the full amount and then tried to split it 50/50 with the friend, not considering that there are three people in total.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is because the author and their girlfriend are splitting their own expenses, but when adding the friend, the total number of people becomes three. If the Uber is a shared ride, the cost should be split among all three. So the author paid $90, so each person should pay $30. But the author is asking the friend for $45, which is half of the total, not a third. That would mean the author and girlfriend are paying $45 together, which is not right because there are three people. So the author is splitting the cost as if there are two entities (the couple as one, the friend as another), leading to 50/50. But actually, each person's share should be 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the friend is correct in saying they should pay a third. The author's mistake was not considering that the total number of people is three, hence the cost should be divided by three. The author is in the wrong for not splitting it into three parts. The $15 difference is because the author took half ($45) minus the friend's correct third ($30), which is $15. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't divide the cost properly among all three people. The answer should be A.\n"
