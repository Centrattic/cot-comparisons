This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 with their friend when there were three people total. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses even out, but in this case, the friend was picked up on the way to the airport. The Uber cost $90, and the author paid it and then asked the friend for $45, which is half. The friend argues it should be a third, so $30, making the author's share $60. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for wanting to split it 50/50 instead of 50% for the couple and 33% for the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who is right in terms of splitting the cost. The key here is how the ride was structured. The author and their girlfriend are a couple, living together, and they usually split expenses but end up balancing out. The friend was picked up on the way. So the ride was from their location to the airport, with the friend being a third person. The question is whether the friend should pay half or a third.\n\nIf the ride was shared by three people, the fairest way would be each paying a third. However, the author and their girlfriend live together and might consider themselves as a single entity when splitting costs. In that case, the couple could be considered one entity and the friend as another. So if the couple paid half and the friend paid half, that would be splitting the cost between two groups. But the friend might see it as three individuals, hence the third.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend count as one, so 50/50 between the couple and the friend. The friend argues that since there are three people, it should be split three ways. The author is now upset because the friend is refusing to pay the $15 difference, leading to a rift in the friendship.\n\nLegally, there's no strict rule here. It's a matter of social norms and agreements. If the author had communicated beforehand that the friend would be sharing the cost equally with the couple, maybe the friend would have agreed. But since the author didn't specify, the friend's expectation might have been different. In many situations, splitting costs based on the number of people is standard. So if three people take a ride, each paying a third is common. However, if two people are already going together and the third is a lift, sometimes the third might pay a portion, but the exact amount can vary based on prior agreement.\n\nThe author's mistake might be in not clarifying beforehand how the costs would be split. By assuming the couple counts as one and the friend as another, they might have overlooked the friend's expectation of splitting three ways. The $15 might seem trivial, but the fact that it's causing a rift suggests that the author's approach was not acceptable to the friend. The author is now making a big deal out of it, which might be unnecessary if they're willing to adjust their stance. However, if the author's logic is that the couple is a single entity, then their split is justified, but the friend's perspective is also valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If splitting as two groups (couple and friend), then 50/50 makes sense. But if splitting among three individuals, each should pay a third. The author didn't set the expectation beforehand. The friend's refusal to pay the $15 difference might be because he believes he should only pay $30, and the author is asking for $45. The author is holding onto a $15 claim, which might not be worth the friendship damage. The answer hinges on whether the couple should be considered as one or two individuals. If the couple is a single entity, then 50/50 is fair. If not, then the friend is right. Since the couple usually splits expenses but balances them out, treating them as a single entity in this case is reasonable. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is a gray area. However, the author's insistence on the $15 could be seen as being in the wrong if it's causing unnecessary conflict. But based on the reasoning provided, the author's approach is valid if the couple is considered as one entity.\n"
