This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting an Uber fare. The author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The total was $90, and the author paid and then asked the friend to split the cost 50/50, which would be $45 each. But the friend thought it should be a third each, so $30. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for insisting on the 50/50 split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how these kinds of splits usually work. If three people are sharing a ride, the typical approach is to divide the cost by three. That's fair because each person benefits equally from the ride. The author and their girlfriend are considered as one entity, but they were two people. However, the friend was a third person. So splitting into two parts (50/50) would mean the author and girlfriend are paying 50% and the friend 50%, but there are three people. That might not be fair because the friend only used part of the ride, maybe? Wait, the friend was picked up on the way to the airport. So the Uber route was from the author and girlfriend's place to the friend's pickup point and then to the airport. The friend's portion of the ride was shorter than the full 45-60 minutes. So maybe the cost isn't exactly a third. But the total fare was $90, and the friend was added in the middle.\n\nBut the author paid the full amount and then tried to split 50/50. The friend probably thought that since there were three people involved, each should pay a third. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are considered as one unit, but that's two people. So if you split into two, the author and girlfriend would cover their part (the first part of the ride) and the friend covers his part (the second part). However, in reality, the Uber fare is for the entire trip, including both the first leg and the second leg. So the cost of the ride includes the distance and time for all parts. The friend would be paying for the part of the ride after he joined, but the author and girlfriend are paying for the entire ride. So maybe the correct split would be based on how much each person used the ride.\n\nBut in practice, people often just split it equally when multiple people are in the car, regardless of the exact distance each person traveled. So if three people are in the car for the whole ride, each pays a third. But in this case, the friend only joined partway. So maybe the split should be different. However, the author's friend might not have considered that when he agreed to get picked up. If the author didn't mention splitting costs beforehand, maybe the friend assumed it would be split equally among three. The author's approach was to split between two entities (themselves as a couple and the friend as one), but that's two people versus one, so 50/50. But the friend is one person, so splitting 50/50 would mean the couple pays 50% and the friend 50%, which would be $45 each. However, the couple is two people, so effectively each of them would pay $22.50 and the friend $45. But that's not how the author explained it. The author says they considered themselves as one entity, so the split is two entities (the couple) and the friend, making two parts. So each part is 50%. The friend would pay half, which is $45. But the friend thought it should be split three ways, which would be $30 each. The author is holding a $15 difference.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key factors are whether the split was fair. If the friend joined the ride mid-way, maybe he should pay for the portion he used. However, it's common to split the total cost among all passengers, even if they didn't ride the entire distance. The author and their girlfriend paid for the entire ride, so they might have the right to split the total among all passengers. If the friend was in the car for part of the trip, but the fare is for the entire trip, then technically all three passengers benefited from the ride. The author paid the full amount and then tried to split equally. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are a single entity, but in reality, they are two people. If all three were in the car for the entire ride, it's three people, so each pays a third. If the friend only joined partway, maybe the split should be based on distance or time. However, in practice, people often just split equally when it's not clear. The author's mistake might be not clarifying the split beforehand. The friend might have expected a three-way split, and the author's insistence on a 50/50 could be seen as unfair. The amount in question is $15, which isn't huge, but holding a grudge over it might be unnecessary. The author is being rigid about the split, which could be causing the friendship issue. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and for making it a big deal over $15. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
