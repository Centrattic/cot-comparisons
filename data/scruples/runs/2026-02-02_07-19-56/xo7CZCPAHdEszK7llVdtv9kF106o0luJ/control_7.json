This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50-50 with their friend when there were three people total. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend took an Uber to the airport, picked up a friend along the way, and ended up splitting the $90 fare as 50-50 between themselves and the friend, making the friend pay $45. The friend argues it should be one-third each, which is $30. The author is now wondering if they're wrong for insisting on the 50-50 split and causing some tension in the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual norms around splitting costs in shared rides. Typically, when multiple people share a ride, the cost is split equally among all passengers. In this case, there were three people: the author, his girlfriend, and the friend. So the fair split would be each paying $30. However, the author and his girlfriend considered themselves as one entity, hence splitting the cost with the friend as 50-50. That's where the misunderstanding might have come from.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author and girlfriend live together and might have a habit of splitting expenses in their own way, but the friend isn't part of that arrangement. 2) The friend was picked up in the Uber, so he's an additional passenger. 3) The author paid the entire fare and then sent a request for $45, expecting the friend to cover half the total cost. 4) The friend thinks it should be $30 each. 5) The author is now upset about a $15 difference, which seems like a small amount but has led to a strained friendship.\n\nThe main issue is whether splitting the cost equally among all passengers is the standard practice. If there were three people, each should contribute a third. However, the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, leading to a 50-50 split with the friend. This approach might be seen as unfair because the friend is being charged half the total fare, which is more than his actual share. The author's reasoning is that they (as a couple) are a single unit, but in shared rides, each individual typically splits the cost equally regardless of relationship status. \n\nAnother angle is the initial arrangement. The author called the Uber and paid for it, then sent the friend a request for $45. The friend wasn't part of the initial planning, so maybe the author should have clarified the cost split beforehand. Since it wasn't discussed before the ride, the friend might have expected a fair split based on the number of people. The author's insistence on $15 more than a third could be seen as being inconsiderate, especially since the amount is relatively small and causing a rift in the friendship.\n\nIt's also worth considering the principle of fairness. If each person benefits from the ride equally, they should contribute equally. The fact that the author and girlfriend live together doesn't change the fact that the friend was an additional passenger. The author's approach might come off as trying to get the friend to pay more than his fair share, which is where the AITA comes in. The friend is justified in feeling it should be a third each, and the author being upset over $15 is perhaps the real issue here\u2014being too focused on a small amount over a friendship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's approach of splitting the cost 50-50 with the friend (making it $45) when there were three people is incorrect. The fair split would be $30 each. By charging $15 more than his share, the author is in the wrong. The fact that the author is making a big deal out of a small amount and not considering the friend's perspective also contributes to being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
