This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting an Uber cost 50/50 among three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend took their friend to the airport via Uber, which cost $90. The author paid and then asked the friend for $45 (half), but the friend thinks it should be a third. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for making a $15 issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the typical social norms around splitting costs. When you have a group of people sharing a ride, the usual approach is to split the cost equally. In this case, there are three people: the author, girlfriend, and friend. If they all benefited from the Uber, then each should pay a third. However, the author and their girlfriend usually split things 50/50 between themselves, treating themselves as a single unit. The author then considered their friend as the other unit, leading to a 50/50 split. \n\nBut here's the catch: the friend was a third person in the ride. The author's logic might be that since they're a couple and they usually split costs between themselves, they count as one, and the friend is another. However, in reality, the Uber cost was for three people. The standard approach would be to split the total by three, so each person pays $30. The author asked for $45, which is half of $90, implying a two-way split between their couple and the friend. The friend's argument is that it should be three people, hence $30 each.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was in not considering the friend as a third person. By splitting the cost as if there were only two entities (the couple and the friend), they effectively overcharged the friend. The friend is right to question that, as it's a third of the cost, not half. The author is now holding onto a $15 difference, which is a significant portion of the total fare (16.66% of $90 is $15). \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they usually don't split everything with their girlfriend, but in this case, the friend was an external person. The logic of treating the couple as one unit might not apply here because the friend wasn't part of their usual shared expenses. So the author's approach was perhaps inconsistent. \n\nMoreover, the friend's refusal to talk unless the author drops the $15 suggests that the author's insistence is causing tension. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this stance. Since splitting costs among three people should be equal, the author is technically in the wrong for charging 50% to the third person. The $15 is actually the correct difference, and the friend is right to object. Therefore, the author's decision to make a big deal out of the $15 is problematic because the initial split was incorrect. The author should have charged a third, and their insistence on half is the issue. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
