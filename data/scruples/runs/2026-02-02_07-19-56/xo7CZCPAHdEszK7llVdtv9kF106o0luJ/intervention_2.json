This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting an Uber cost. There are three people: the author, his girlfriend, and a friend. The author paid for the Uber, which cost $90, and then tried to split it 50/50 with the friend. The friend expected to pay a third, so there's a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how splitting costs typically works in such situations. When multiple people are sharing a ride, the common approach is to split the cost equally unless there's some prior agreement otherwise. Here, the author and his girlfriend are living together, so maybe they consider their expenses as a single unit. But the friend is separate. The author's reasoning was that they (the couple) count as one entity and the friend as another, hence 50/50. However, the friend argues that since there are three people, each should pay a third. \n\nWait, but the friend was only in the Uber for part of the ride. He was picked up on the way to the airport, so maybe the cost isn't split equally because he didn't share the entire distance. The initial part of the ride would be just the couple, and then adding the friend's part of the trip. But maybe the Uber fare is calculated based on the total trip, including all stops. So if the friend got picked up near the couple's place, the total fare would be higher than if they went alone. But the author paid the whole $90, which includes the cost for all three. \n\nThe key here is whether splitting the cost fairly depends on how much each person benefits from the trip. The author and girlfriend might have saved money by pooling the ride, but the friend also saved because he got a ride. If the friend had gone alone, maybe his fare would be less. But since the total was $90, splitting it equally would mean each pays $30. However, the author and girlfriend are a couple who usually split expenses between themselves, but in this case, they're considering themselves as one entity. \n\nSo the author's logic is that the couple (as one) and the friend (as another) split 50/50. That would mean each pays $45. But the friend thinks it should be three people, so $30 each. The author is asking if he's at fault for the $15 difference. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting equally among all participants is standard unless there's a different agreement. Since the friend was a third person who benefited from the ride, expecting him to pay a third (around $30) seems fair. By charging him $45, the author is taking more than his share (the couple's share). The author's reasoning of combining their expenses into one entity might not be valid here because each person's share is based on individual usage. \n\nAdditionally, the author called the Uber, so he had control over the payment and the split. The friend might not have expected to pay 50% because that's a common way people split costs when three are involved. The author's insistence on the split could be seen as being inconsiderate, especially over a relatively small amount. The fact that the friend hasn't responded since the request suggests that the author might have overstepped. \n\nIn many cases, splitting expenses among friends is about being considerate and not making a big deal out of minor amounts. The $15 difference is significant relative to the total ($90), but it's a small amount in real terms. The author's approach could be seen as causing unnecessary conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and for making an issue out of a minor discrepancy.\n"
