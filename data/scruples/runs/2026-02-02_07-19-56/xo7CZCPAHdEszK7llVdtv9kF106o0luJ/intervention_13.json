This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people total. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, so they considered themselves as one entity. The friend joined the ride, so they split the cost as two entities, each paying half. The friend thought it should be a third each. The author sent a request for $45, which is half of $90, but the friend argued for a third, which would be $30. The author is now trying to get the $15 back but the friend won't talk about it unless the author drops the demand.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if splitting 50/50 is fair when there are three people. But wait, the author is grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one entity because they usually split expenses. So maybe they considered it as two entities: their group and the friend. That would make splitting 50/50 fair if the friend was the third person. However, the friend might see it as three separate people sharing the ride, hence each paying a third. The key here is whether the author and their girlfriend are considered one paying unit or two.\n\nIf the author and girlfriend are a single unit (since they split expenses among themselves), then adding the friend as another unit makes two units total. So splitting 50/50 between the two units would be fair. But if the friend sees it as three individuals, then each should pay a third. The problem arises from differing perspectives on how to group the people. The author might be in the wrong if they assumed their grouping was the norm without discussing it. However, if the friend didn't contribute anything to the ride's cost during the trip and only joined partway, maybe the split is different. Also, the author paid the full amount upfront, so they're trying to recoup their $45 by charging the friend. But if the friend only used part of the ride (since they dropped off earlier), maybe the cost isn't evenly split. However, the scenario states that the friend got off at the airport and the author and girlfriend continued, but the total fare was $90. The author might be splitting the entire fare, but the friend only used part of the route. Wait, the friend was picked up on the way to the airport and dropped off at the airport. So the friend's portion of the ride is part of the total cost. Calculating exact shares based on distance or time might be complicated. However, the author didn't do that; they just split 50/50. That might not account for the fact that the friend didn't use the entire ride. If the friend only used part of the Uber, maybe their share should be less than 50%. However, without knowing the exact cost breakdown, it's hard to say. Alternatively, if the friend rode the entire way, splitting equally makes sense. The author's mistake could be in not clarifying the split beforehand. They assumed their way, but the friend expected a third. The author is making a big deal over $15, which is a small amount, but the issue is about fairness. Depending on the perspective, both sides could have a point. The author might be in the wrong for not discussing the split first and then insisting on the $15. The friend might be right in expecting a third. However, the author's grouping of themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity could be reasonable, making 50/50 fair. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's insistence on the $15 is causing tension. So maybe the author is in the wrong for making a big deal out of it, even if their initial split was fair from their perspective.\n"
