This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for splitting an Uber cost 50/50 among three people. \n\nSo the scenario is that the author and their girlfriend live together and picked up a friend in their Uber to the airport. The ride cost $90, and the author asked the friend to pay half, which would be $45, assuming two entities (the couple as one and the friend as another). The friend, however, believes it should be split three ways, hence paying $30.\n\nThe key question here is whether splitting 50/50 is fair when there are three people. The author's reasoning is that they (the couple) act as a single unit, so two units in total. The friend's reasoning is that there are three individuals, so a third each. \n\nNow, fairness in cost-sharing can be subjective. The author initiated the ride and paid for it, then asked the friend to split the cost. If the friend was a passenger in the ride, they benefit from the ride and should contribute. But how much they should contribute depends on the group's agreement. \n\nIf the couple typically splits costs between themselves but considers themselves as one unit in this case, that's their prerogative. However, the friend might not have expected to pay 50% because they were an extra person. The author is now following through on splitting 50/50, which the friend disputes, leading to tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if they planned from the start to split the cost 50/50 with the friend, and the friend agreed, then it's fair. But if the expectation wasn't clear, then the author might have assumed responsibility for the entire cost. The fact that the author paid and then asked for half could be seen as imposing an agreement without prior discussion. The friend's refusal to pay the $15 difference might stem from feeling the split isn't fair. \n\nIn many social situations, when someone offers a ride and includes others, it's common to split the cost based on the number of people. So three people would split it three ways. However, if the couple is considered as one unit (since they're a couple and share expenses), two units would split it. This ambiguity could lead to different interpretations. \n\nThe author's main issue is making a big deal about $15. If the friend is unwilling to pay $45, the author is holding this over their head. Even if they're technically correct about splitting two ways, persisting over a small amount that's causing a rift might be unreasonable. The author could have been more flexible or handled it differently, perhaps by suggesting a different split or not pushing the matter if it's causing a friendship issue. \n\nIn summary, while the 50/50 split isn't inherently wrong if the couple considers themselves as one unit, the author's insistence on the $15 difference might be unwarranted, especially if it's leading to a friendship problem. The wrong here could lie in how the author is handling the situation rather than the split itself. So the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the way they're enforcing the split rather than the split itself.\n"
