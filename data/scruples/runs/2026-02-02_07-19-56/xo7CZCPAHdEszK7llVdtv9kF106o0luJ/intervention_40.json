This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The total fare was $90, so splitting 50/50 would mean each of the two (the author and friend) pay $45 each, but since there are three people, one might argue each should pay $30.\n\nFirst, I need to consider who initiated the ride. The author called the Uber, so they paid for it first. The friend was picked up on the way. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are a single unit, hence splitting as two units (them and the friend), leading to a 50/50 split. The friend, however, thinks it should be a third each because there are three people. \n\nThe key here is the expectation of splitting costs. If the author had clearly stated before the ride that they'd be splitting 50/50, maybe the friend would have agreed. But since the friend didn't agree and now the author is chasing the $45, it's causing a rift. The author is focusing on a $15 difference, which seems small, but the act of insisting on the split after the fact without prior agreement could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they usually split things evenly with their girlfriend, so treating themselves as one unit might make sense between them. However, when involving others, the standard is often to split by the number of people. The friend's argument for a third is more about proportional sharing. \n\nThe author's approach might be seen as not considering the friend's perspective. Insisting on the $15 could be seen as being too rigid over a minor amount. The friend's refusal to talk unless the author drops the matter suggests the author's insistence is causing more harm than the money's worth. \n\nSo, while the author has a point in wanting to share the cost, their method of enforcing a 50/50 split without prior agreement might be the issue here. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they made a big deal out of a small amount and didn't coordinate the split beforehand.\n"
