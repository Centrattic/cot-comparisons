This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and girlfriend called an Uber to the airport, picked up a friend along the way, and then tried to split the $90 fare equally between the two of them (author + girlfriend as one entity and the friend as another). The friend thought it should be a third each, leading to a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual norms for splitting costs. Typically, if three people share a ride, it's fair to split the total equally, each paying a third. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one, which makes sense if they're a couple and usually split costs between them, but when adding another person, maybe the friend expected all three to split. The key here is how the author calculated the split. By treating their own two as one entity, they ended up charging the friend half instead of a third. That's probably where the issue is. The friend would reasonably expect each person (including the couple as two individuals) to pay a third each. But the author considered the couple as one, so two people total. That might not be fair because the friend is one person, so splitting 50-50 would mean the friend pays more than their share if there are three people. Wait, actually, if the couple counts as one, then two entities (couple and friend), so half each. But if there are three people, then each should pay a third. The confusion arises from whether the couple should be counted as one or two. The friend likely saw it as three individuals: two from the couple and one friend. So the fair split would be each paying a third. The author, however, grouped themselves and their girlfriend, leading to a 50-50 split. So the author is asking if they're in the wrong for that $15 difference. \n\nThe question is whether the author's approach is fair. If the friend thought it was three people, then each should pay $30. The author paid $45 (half of $90), which would mean the friend pays $45, but the author's side (couple) paid $45 together (each paying $22.50). But the friend would expect $30. However, the author's mistake is in not considering that the couple should be two people. So the total is three people: the couple as two and the friend as one. So splitting three ways would be $30 each. The author's approach splits into two entities (couple and friend), leading to $45 each. The friend is right to think it should be $30. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for the fact that there were three people in the ride, each contributing to the cost. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
