This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 instead of 1/3 each when there were three people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their girlfriend live together and called an Uber for the airport. They picked up a friend along the way, and the total cost was $90. The author paid for it and then tried to split it 50/50 with the friend, charging $45. The friend thinks it should be divided into thirds, so $30 each. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for making a big deal over $15.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: how the ride was structured. The author and their girlfriend live together and probably share expenses. The friend joined them on the way to the airport. The question is about fairness in splitting the cost. \n\nIf all three people were riding from the same pickup point to the airport, then splitting equally would make sense. But the author and their girlfriend might have already had the ride planned, and the friend was just a convenience. So maybe the friend only benefited from part of the ride? Like, if the author and girlfriend were going to the airport, and the friend was getting picked up along the way, then the cost of the ride isn't entirely due to the friend. \n\nIn that case, splitting 50/50 could be fair because the friend's presence didn't double the cost. Let me think about Uber pricing. Uber charges based on distance and time. If the friend was picked up en route, the total cost would be more than if it was just the author and girlfriend, but maybe not double. For example, if the original ride would have cost $60 for the author and girlfriend, adding the friend might add $30, making the total $90. Then the friend's share would be $30 instead of $45. But the author is charging $45, which is half of the total, implying they're treating the friend as another person sharing equally, but maybe the friend didn't contribute to the entire cost.\n\nAlternatively, if the friend was going in the same direction and the Uber was more efficient because of him, maybe the cost per person is lower. But if the author and girlfriend were the ones initiating the ride, perhaps they should consider that the friend's share is less because they didn't incur the full cost. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation. The author mentions they usually split everything 50/50 with their girlfriend, so they see themselves as one unit. Then, with the friend, it's two units, hence 50/50. But the friend might argue that since there are three people, it should be three parts. However, the author and girlfriend are a couple living together, so maybe treating them as a single unit is reasonable. In that case, splitting 50/50 with the third person is fair.\n\nBut the problem is the friend's perspective. He might think that all three should split the cost equally, regardless of the author's relationship with their girlfriend. The author is insisting on 50/50, which leads to a $15 difference. The author is holding onto this, not letting it go, which is causing tension. \n\nSo, was the author wrong to split it 50/50? If the ride's cost was significantly increased by adding the friend, then maybe the friend should pay more than a third. But if the friend's addition didn't double the cost, then 50/50 might be unfair. Without knowing the exact cost breakdown, it's hard to say. However, the author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are seen as a single unit. If that's their usual practice, then maybe they are right. However, the friend might not be aware of that arrangement and expected a third. \n\nThe author is making a big deal out of $15, which could be unnecessary. Maybe it's better to let it go for such a small amount. But if the principle of splitting costs is important to the author, then they might feel justified. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting equally among all three people (each paying $30) would be the most equitable, but if the author and girlfriend consider themselves as one, then splitting with the friend would be 50/50. The issue is the expectation mismatch. The author might be in the wrong if the friend expected a third. Alternatively, the friend might be wrong to expect a third if the author's setup is a couple. \n\nBut in social situations, unless previously agreed, splitting equally is common. The author decided to charge 50/50 without discussing it beforehand. If the friend felt it should be 1/3, the author's insistence on 50/50 could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the author's usual arrangement with their girlfriend is to split 50/50, then treating the friend as another entity would be 50/50. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's approach was communicated and if the friend had any prior expectations. Since the author didn't mention discussing this with the friend before the ride, the friend might have reasonably expected a third. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and making a big deal over a small amount. So, answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
