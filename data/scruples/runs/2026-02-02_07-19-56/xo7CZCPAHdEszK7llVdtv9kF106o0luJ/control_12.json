This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50-50 when there were three people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the user, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The user paid for the $90 ride and then asked the friend to pay half, which would be $45. The friend argued that it should be a third each, so $30. The user is now wondering if they're at fault for insisting on the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The user and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, so they count as a single entity. The third person is a friend who joined them. The user called the Uber, so maybe they assumed responsibility for the ride, but then wanted to split the cost with the friend. \n\nThe main point of contention is whether splitting 50-50 is fair when there are three people. If you think of the user and girlfriend as one unit, then two units in total (them and the friend), splitting 50-50 makes sense. But if all three are separate individuals, then splitting into thirds would be fair. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they typically split expenses 50-50 with their girlfriend, so maybe they considered the friend as a third party. However, the friend might have expected a third each because there were three people in the ride. \n\nAnother angle is that the user initiated the ride and picked up the friend along the way. The friend might have assumed that the cost would be split based on usage or proximity. Since the friend lives near the user, maybe the Uber route was optimized, but the user still had to make a detour to pick them up. That could affect how the cost is distributed.\n\nAlso, the user is holding onto the $15 difference, which might be causing the friend to avoid communication. The user might be overemphasizing a relatively small amount, which could hurt the friendship more than the actual money. \n\nI think the key here is whether the original arrangement was clear. If the user didn't specify beforehand how the cost would be split, it's a bit of a grey area. However, since the friend joined the ride, it's reasonable to expect that he would contribute proportionally. Splitting into thirds would be more equitable in that case. \n\nSo, the user is splitting the cost as 50-50 between their couple and the friend, but if the friend is a third person, then splitting into thirds is fair. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't clarify before the ride and then insisted on a different split. The $15 might seem trivial, but the principle of fairness matters. The user's approach could come off as unfair to the friend, leading to the strained friendship.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the user is in the wrong for not considering a three-way split and making a big deal out of the $15, which might not be worth the friendship tension.\n"
