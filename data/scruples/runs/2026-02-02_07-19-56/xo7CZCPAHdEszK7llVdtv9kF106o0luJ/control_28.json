This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend called an Uber to the airport and picked up a friend along the way. The total cost was $90, and the author paid and then asked the friend for $45, splitting it equally. The friend argues it should be a third, so $30. The author is wondering if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs typically works in such situations. When multiple people share a ride, it's common to split the cost based on how many people are in the ride. In this case, there were three people: the author, the girlfriend, and the friend. So splitting the cost equally among three would be $30 each. However, the author and their girlfriend are considered as one entity because they live together and usually split expenses equally between themselves, but when they share with others, maybe they count as two people?\n\nWait, the author says they \"count as one entity\" and the friend as another. That might be the key point. The author and girlfriend are a couple who lives together and maybe share expenses, so when splitting with others, they might be considered as one paying entity. So the Uber cost is split between two entities: the couple and the friend. That would make it $45 each. But the friend expects a third, which would be $30, thinking of three individuals. So the disagreement is between splitting as two entities (couple and friend) vs three individuals.\n\nSo, the question is whether it's fair to split as two or three. If the couple is considered as one (because they split their own expenses and don't charge each other), then they should split with the friend as two entities, making $45 each. However, the friend might not know that the couple already splits their own costs and assumes everyone should pay a third. The author's reasoning is that since they don't split with each other, the friend is the third person, so they split 50/50 between couple and friend. \n\nBut the friend might see it as three people, so each should pay a third. The issue here is communication. The author didn't clarify the arrangement beforehand. Maybe the friend assumed a 1/3 split, but the author assumed 50-50 between two entities. The problem is that the author didn't explain their reasoning before sending the request for $45, leading to confusion. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't discuss the splitting method beforehand. However, the friend might also be at fault for expecting a different split. The question is whether the author's approach is reasonable. If the couple is considered as one entity (since they don't split between themselves), then the split between two entities is fair. But if each person is an individual, then three-way split is fair. \n\nThe key point is that the author and girlfriend are a single unit in their usual cost-splitting, so maybe they're right to split with the friend as two units. However, the friend didn't know that, so the author should have explained that upfront. The author's mistake was not clarifying the split method before charging $45. The $15 difference is the core of the issue. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate clearly. Alternatively, if the author's reasoning is valid (couple as one entity), then they're not wrong. The answer depends on whether the couple's approach is standard. Typically, when splitting a ride, people split equally among all passengers. The author's approach of splitting between two entities (couple and friend) is unconventional unless agreed upon beforehand. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not explaining this and for splitting it as 50/50 when the standard is per person. Thus, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
