This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The author and their girlfriend live together and picked up a friend on the way to the airport. The ride cost $90, and the author paid the whole amount and asked the friend for $45. The friend argues it should be a third instead.\n\nHmm, so the author split the cost as two entities\u2014themselves and the friend\u2014hence 50/50. But there were three people: the author, girlfriend, and friend. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they should have considered all three people. But wait, the author mentions that they and their girlfriend usually don't split everything and it's close to even at the end. But in this case, the friend was only joining for part of the ride. \n\nThe friend lives in the direction of the airport and just a mile or two away. So maybe his portion of the ride was a small part of the total cost. The total fare was $90. If the author and girlfriend were going all the way to the airport, and the friend was picked up on the way, perhaps the author's share is more than just 50%. \n\nWait, the author called the Uber, so they had control over the cost. If the friend was only using part of the ride, then splitting 50/50 might be unfair. The author might have paid for the entire ride upfront and then tried to split equally, but that's not considering the different distances each person traveled. \n\nThe usual approach is to split costs based on the distance each person traveled. Since the friend's pickup was just a mile or two away from the author's location but in the direction of the airport, maybe his segment of the ride added a bit more, but not a third. The total ride's cost is a combination of different distances. However, the author might not have considered that when splitting the cost. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend isn't mentioned in the payment. The author paid the whole Uber and then tried to split with the friend. The girlfriend might have covered the author's part normally, so the author is trying to split with the friend. But the friend's share should be based on his actual usage. \n\nSo if the ride was from the author's and girlfriend's home to the friend's pickup point and then to the airport, the friend's part is a small segment. The total fare would be split based on the distance each person was in the car. The author and girlfriend were in the car for the entire ride, while the friend was only for part of it. Therefore, the friend should pay less than a third. \n\nBut the author split it 50/50, which is unfair to the friend. So the author is in the wrong. The correct split would be the friend paying for the part of the ride from his pickup to the airport, and the author and girlfriend paying for the rest. Since the author paid the full amount, they should adjust the split based on actual usage. \n\nThe $15 difference is a point of contention, but if the split was incorrect, the author is at fault. Even if they usually don't split, this case is different because the friend didn't use the full ride. So the author should have considered that and not assumed 50/50. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
