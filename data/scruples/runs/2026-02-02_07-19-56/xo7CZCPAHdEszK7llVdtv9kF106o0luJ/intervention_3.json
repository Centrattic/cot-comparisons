This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people in total. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, so they considered themselves as one entity. The friend was picked up on the way, and the author paid the full $90 fare, then asked the friend to pay half. The friend thought it should be a third, and now there's some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The Uber cost $90, and there were three people involved: the author, his girlfriend, and the friend. But the author and girlfriend are splitting expenses among themselves, so maybe they see themselves as one unit. The author called the Uber, paid for it, then tried to get half from the friend. The friend argues it should be a third.\n\nSo the main question is: should the cost be split 50/50 (author and girlfriend as one, friend as another) or 1/3 each? \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if all three people benefited equally from the ride, then splitting it evenly three ways makes sense. However, the author and girlfriend might have a history of splitting their own expenses, so maybe they considered themselves as a single entity, making it two groups. The friend, being a third person, would then be half. But that's more of their internal arrangement, which the friend might not be aware of or agree with. \n\nThe problem here is that the author assumed they and the girlfriend count as one for splitting the cost, but the friend might not see it that way. If the author had discussed this beforehand, it might have been clearer. Since the friend was not part of their usual expense-splitting arrangement, expecting him to pay half might be unfair because he only used part of the ride. Wait, no, the friend was picked up on the way to the airport, so he was with them for the entire ride? Or was he dropped off first? The original post says they split ways from the friend first. So the Uber was a ride that included all three people from start to finish? Or did the author and girlfriend continue to the airport, and the friend was dropped off somewhere else first?\n\nThe description says they offered to pick him up on the way to the airport. So the Uber started at the author's location, picked up the friend, and then went to the airport. So all three were in the ride together. Therefore, the friend was part of the entire trip. So the cost should be split among three people. \n\nBut the author and girlfriend usually split everything 50/50 between them, so maybe they consider their expenses as shared. But when splitting with an external person, perhaps the friend should be charged based on usage. However, since all three were in the ride together, it's reasonable to split the cost three ways. The author's approach of splitting 50/50 (author/boyfriend as one, friend as another) would mean the friend pays half, but the fair split would be each paying a third. \n\nSo the author is asking if they're in the wrong for trying to charge $45 instead of $30. The friend thinks it should be $30. The author is making a big deal out of a $15 difference. The question is whether the author is at fault here. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if all three used the entire Uber ride, then splitting three ways is fair. The author's approach assumes that they and the girlfriend form a single unit, which might not be valid when including a third person. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider that the friend should only pay a third. However, maybe the author thought since they usually split things between themselves and the friend, the friend should cover half. But since there were three people, splitting three ways is more equitable. \n\nAdditionally, the author called the Uber, paid for it, and then tried to get half from the friend. The friend's refusal to talk about it unless the author drops the $15 suggests that the friend feels the split should be different. The author is holding a grudge over a small amount, which could be unnecessary. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the cost 50/50, not about making a big deal over $15. \n\nSo, if the author is insisting on getting half when it's actually a three-way split, they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). However, if the author's arrangement with their girlfriend is such that they consider themselves as one entity, and the friend was an extra, maybe splitting two ways is okay. But that's a bit of a stretch because the friend was part of the ride. \n\nIn most cases, when multiple people share a ride, the cost is split by the number of people. So three people would each pay a third. The author's approach of considering their own expenses as split between two but then grouping into one for splitting with a third person is a bit of a conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not splitting the cost three ways. So the answer is A.\n"
