This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the Uber and paid for it, then asked a friend to split the cost 50/50 among two people (even though there were three people total) is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the scenario is: three people in an Uber. The person (author) called the Uber, paid $90, and then split the cost 50/50 with the friend, meaning the author and their girlfriend paid $45 each, but there's a third person. Wait, actually, the author is splitting with the third friend, right? The author and girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, but in this case, the third friend is being charged half the fare. The friend argues it should be a third each since there are three people.\n\nHmm. The key here is how the costs should be divided. If all three people are in the ride together, then each should contribute 1/3. But the author is treating themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity, hence splitting with the friend as two people. But that's not accurate because there are three individuals in the ride. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend usually split things 50/50, so they're treating it as two entities. However, the third person is only one person. So the correct division should be three people, each paying a third. The author is charging the third person half, which is more than their fair share. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because the third person should pay 1/3, not 1/2. The author is making a $15 issue out of splitting the cost incorrectly. Even though the amount is small, the error in division is on the author's side. So the answer is A.\n"
