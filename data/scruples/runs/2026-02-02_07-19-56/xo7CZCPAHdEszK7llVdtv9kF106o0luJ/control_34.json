This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost between three people. The author paid $90 for an Uber that included a friend, and then tried to split it 50/50 between the couple and the friend. The friend thinks it should be 1/3 each instead. The author is wondering if making a big deal out of $15 is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who is at fault here. The main issue is the cost division. The key points are:\n\n1. The couple lives together and usually doesn't split costs, considering themselves as one entity. The friend is separate.\n2. The author paid the entire fare and then asked the friend for $45 (half), but the friend argues it should be $30 (a third).\n3. The author hasn't seen the friend since, who refuses to discuss it unless the author waives the $15.\n\nSo, the question is about whether splitting the fare as a couple (two people as one entity) is fair versus splitting it among three individuals. Typically, when splitting costs, it's based on the number of people sharing the expense. If three people took the ride, each should pay 1/3. However, the couple might see it as two people contributing to one entity, so the friend covers the other half. But that's not standard practice. Usually, unless there's a prior agreement, splitting by the number of people is the norm. The author's reasoning might come from not wanting to split with their partner, but including a third person should be a third. The $15 is the difference between half and a third of $90. The friend is probably upset because they think their share is less. \n\nAnother angle: The couple's arrangement of splitting expenses isn't relevant here because the friend was part of the ride. The cost is for three people sharing the Uber, so the fair split would be three equal parts. The author's approach of treating the couple as a single entity is not typical. Most people would expect each individual to pay an equal share unless there's a specific reason. So, the author is in the wrong for not considering the friend as another individual. The $15 isn't a huge amount, but the principle is about fairness in splitting. The author's insistence on that amount might be causing the rift. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
