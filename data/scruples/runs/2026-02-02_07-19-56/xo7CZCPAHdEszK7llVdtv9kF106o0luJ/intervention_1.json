This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about splitting an Uber fare. The author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The total was $90, and they paid for it and then tried to split the cost 50/50 between the author/friend, which would be $45 each. The friend thought it should be a third each, so $30. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for pushing for the $45 split, leading to a $15 dispute.\n\nFirst, the key issue is how to split the cost among three people. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, which might be a mistake. If there are three people in the Uber, it's usually split evenly by the number of people, so each person pays a third. The author and their girlfriend are two people, so if they consider themselves as one, that leaves three entities if the friend is another. But that might not be the standard way. Normally, each person pays for themselves. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that they usually split things 50/50 with their girlfriend, so they treated themselves as a single unit. But when another person joins, the math changes. If there are three people in the car, the standard would be three equal parts. The author paid the full amount and then tried to split with the friend as 50/50, which would mean two people sharing the $90, but there were actually three people. That's where the confusion comes in. \n\nSo, the author's mistake is not accounting for all three individuals in the split. By taking their girlfriend into the equation as part of their usual 50/50 arrangement, they ended up charging the friend more than their fair share. The friend's perspective is that each of the three should pay $30, so the author and their girlfriend together would cover $60, and the friend $30. But the author is trying to charge $45 from the friend, which is more than a third. That's a $15 difference, which the author is now holding over the friend. \n\nThe author might think they're being fair because they and their girlfriend usually split things, but that's internal to their relationship. The friend is an external person who wasn't part of that arrangement. So the author should have considered the friend as a separate person and split the total among all three. Since they didn't, they are in the wrong for miscalculating the split and then making a big deal about the $15. The $15 difference comes from their incorrect division of the cost. Therefore, the author is at fault here.\n"
