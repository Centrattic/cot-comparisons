This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 with a friend when three people were in the ride. The total was $90, and the author paid first, then asked the friend for $45 instead of a third, which would be $30. The friend is upset about the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, but in this case, they considered themselves as one entity because they live together. The third person is a friend who joined them on the way to the airport. The author thinks splitting 50/50 is fair because they are two people (the couple) versus the friend. The friend, however, thinks it should be split three ways. \n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are fairness and expectations. When splitting costs, especially in a group, the general expectation is to divide equally unless there's a prior agreement. The author grouped themselves and their partner as one entity, but that might not be the standard. Typically, each person is considered an individual unless they've agreed otherwise. So if three people are in the Uber, each should pay a third. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they usually split expenses 50/50 with their partner, so they treated themselves as one unit. However, the friend might not be aware of this arrangement and expected each person to pay their share. By charging 50% instead of 33%, the author is effectively making the friend pay more than their fair share. \n\nThe author is now following up with a request for $45 instead of $30, which is a $15 difference. The friend is upset and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting the cost three ways is more equitable since there are three people. The author's approach assumes they can group themselves as a single entity, but that might not be the norm. If the couple usually splits things 50/50 between themselves, then when with others, they should consider each person individually. \n\nAdditionally, the author initiated the ride and paid for it, so maybe they should have discussed the splitting beforehand. Since the friend's reaction is negative, it's possible the author didn't consider the friend's perspective. The $15 might seem small, but the issue is about principle and fairness. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because splitting three ways is the standard expectation when three people are involved, regardless of their own internal splitting arrangement. The friend's expectation of 1/3 is the fair division, so the author's 50/50 approach was incorrect.\n"
