This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend called an Uber, picked up a friend, and then tried to split the $90 fare as 50/50 between the author's household and the friend. The friend thought it should be a third each, and now there's tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The author and girlfriend live together and split costs, so they're treating themselves as a single entity. The friend, however, is an individual. So the author is charging the friend half the fare, which is $45, instead of a third, which would be $30. The difference is $15, which the author is trying to get back. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness in splitting costs. If the friend was only a third of the people in the Uber, then technically, splitting 50/50 might be unfair because the author and girlfriend are two people taking one ride, and the friend is another. But the author might argue that since they're a couple and split costs, they're a single unit. However, in terms of cost per person, the friend would be paying more than their share. \n\nAnother angle is the initial arrangement. The author offered the friend a ride; it's possible the friend expected to pay their own fare or not at all. But since they were sharing the ride, splitting the cost is reasonable. The question is how to split it. If the ride's cost is based on distance and time, adding a third person might not significantly reduce the cost, so splitting equally by number of people is fairer. \n\nThe author's approach of 50/50 could be seen as unfair because the friend is being charged more than their share. The author is treating their household as one, but the friend is an individual. So, if there are three people, each should pay a third. However, maybe the author isn't counting themselves as two people because they already split costs. But that's their internal arrangement. When involving a third person, the standard is usually to split by the number of people, not by how a couple splits their own expenses. \n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong because they're charging the friend a larger share (50%) than their actual proportion (33.3%). It's a $15 difference, but the principle is about fairness. The author might have assumed that because they usually split things 50/50 with their girlfriend, they'd apply the same logic here, but that's not considering the third person's perspective. The friend likely expects to pay a third, not half. The author's insistence on the $15 might be causing unnecessary conflict because it's a small amount, but the issue is the fairness of the split. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't split the cost fairly based on the number of people involved.\n"
