This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend picked up a friend for an Uber ride to the airport, and the total was $90. The author paid and then sent a request for $45 to their friend, arguing that their girlfriend and they are one unit, so splitting it as two entities (they as one, the friend as another) makes it 50-50. The friend argues it should be 1/3 each. The author is wondering if they're at fault over a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the fairness of the split. The key point here is how the costs are divided. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend live together, so they consider themselves as a single entity. That makes sense because they might share expenses and the ride benefits both of them. So, if there's one couple and one friend, splitting the cost between two groups would mean each group pays half. However, the friend might see it as three individuals, hence each paying a third. \n\nBut wait, the friend was only in the car for part of the trip. If the friend was picked up partway, maybe the cost isn't equally divided. Uber fares can depend on distance and time. If the author and girlfriend were traveling the entire distance, and the friend joined partway, the cost for the author's group might be higher than for the friend. But the scenario says the friend lives a mile or two away in the direction of the airport, so the Uber was going to pick him up on the way. So maybe the total fare is a combined cost for all three. \n\nThe author's approach is to split 50/50 between their group (couple) and the friend. That would mean the friend pays half, and the couple pays the other half. But if there are three people, splitting into two entities (couple and friend) makes it 50-50. However, the friend might argue that since there are three people, the cost should be split three ways, which would be $30 each. The author is charging $45, which is more than that. Wait, no\u2014the total is $90. If split three ways, each would pay $30. But the author is charging the friend $45, which is higher than that. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the author is splitting it into two parts: they as a unit (couple) pay $45, and the friend pays $45. So total is $90. But if there are three people, maybe the fair split is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend is only responsible for the portion of the ride they used. If the author's group was going the full distance and the friend joined partway, the cost for the friend would be based on the portion they rode. But the problem states that the friend was going to the airport as well, so maybe the entire ride was to the airport for all three. But the friend's pickup location is in the direction of the airport, so maybe the Uber route includes picking him up, which might not add much to the author's original trip. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the couple lives together and shares expenses, they count as one entity. So, the cost is split between two entities (couple and friend), hence 50/50. The friend, however, might see it as three people, so 1/3 each. The key here is how the ride was arranged. If the author's trip would have been the same as if they had gone alone, but they picked up the friend, the friend should pay for the part of the ride they caused. If the friend's inclusion increased the fare, then he should pay for that increase. But if the fare was the same as if they had gone alone, maybe the friend doesn't need to pay. \n\nIn this case, the total fare was $90. If the author's original fare (without the friend) would have been less, the friend should pay the difference. But the problem states that the author called the Uber and paid the total. Since the friend was part of the ride, the author is charging him half. The friend might argue that since there are three people, he should pay a third. \n\nSo, the author is charging $45 vs. the friend paying $30. The difference is $15. The question is whether the author is wrong for making a big deal out of $15. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the ride was equally shared by all three, splitting three ways would be fair. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, which might not be the friend's perspective. The author's approach might be seen as splitting the cost between two groups, but if the friend sees it as three individuals, then charging $45 is more than the fair share. \n\nIn terms of social norms, splitting costs can be subjective. If the author and girlfriend usually split things evenly between themselves, but the friend is a third person, the expectation might differ. The author is making a claim over a small amount, which could be seen as unnecessary if the friend feels the split is unfair. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that their household is one unit, so splitting two ways is fair. However, others might argue that each person should contribute equally. The $15 difference is small, but the author is insisting on it, leading to strain in the friendship. \n\nIn such cases, it's often considered better to drop small amounts for the sake of relationships. The author might be in the wrong not because of the split itself, but because they're making a big deal over $15, which could be seen as petty. However, from the author's perspective, if they consider their group as one entity, splitting 50/50 is fair. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the 50/50 split is justified. If the author's group was going to the airport regardless of the friend, and the friend's inclusion didn't add to the cost, then maybe the friend should pay nothing. But if the friend's presence increased the fare, he should pay for the added cost. Since the fare was $90, and the author doesn't mention the original fare without the friend, it's unclear. \n\nAssuming the fare would have been the same as if the author and girlfriend went alone, the friend shouldn't pay anything. If the fare increased because of the friend, he should pay for the increase. But since the author is charging half, that might be more than the fair share. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong by charging the friend 50% instead of the actual cost incurred by the friend's presence. However, if the author's reasoning of grouping as one entity is acceptable, then maybe not. The key is the fairness of the split based on actual cost. Since the problem doesn't specify the original fare, it's hard to say, but generally, splitting three ways would be fair if all three used the entire ride. Hence, the author is likely in the wrong for charging 50/50 instead of 1/3.\n"
