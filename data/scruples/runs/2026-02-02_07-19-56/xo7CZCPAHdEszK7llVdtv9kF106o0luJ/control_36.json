This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The ride cost $90, and the author paid for it and then asked the friend to pay $45, which is half the cost. The friend thought it should be a third, so $30. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for making a $15 issue.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points here are splitting costs among multiple people and the justification for each share. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, so they consider themselves as one entity. The friend is separate. So they split it 50/50 between their combined entity and the friend. The friend, however, argues that there were three people, so each should pay a third. \n\nThe main question is whether splitting it 50/50 is fair. From a mathematical standpoint, three people would each pay a third, which is about $30. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one, leading to a 50/50 split. This is where the confusion arises. The author's reasoning is that they live together and share expenses, so combining their costs makes sense. The friend, on the other hand, might not see why they should pay double the others just because the author and their girlfriend are a couple. \n\nI need to consider common practices in splitting costs. Usually, if three people take a ride, it's standard to split three ways. However, if two people are acting as a unit (like a couple who shares expenses), they might split with others as a single entity. However, this isn't a universal norm, so the friend might not understand or agree. The author's approach might be seen as reasonable if they consider their shared living and expenses, but others might see it as unfair because the friend is paying more than a third. \n\nThe author is now making a big deal about $15, which is the difference between half and a third. The friend doesn't want to talk about it unless the author drops the request. This suggests that the author's insistence on splitting 50/50 is causing tension. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. There's no absolute right way to split costs unless agreed beforehand. If the author didn't clarify the splitting method before the ride, that's a mistake. But once the ride happened, the friend might feel it's unfair to pay more than their share. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate the plan to split 50/50 with the friend beforehand. However, if the author's approach is based on their usual practice of splitting with their partner, they might not be entirely wrong. \n\nBut in social situations, it's often considered polite to split costs equally among all participants unless otherwise stated. The author's grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one unit could be seen as an oversight in considering the friend's perspective. The author's insistence on the $15 might be unnecessary, especially if the friend is offended. The bigger issue here is not the $15 but the approach to splitting the cost without prior agreement. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's method was communicated. If not, the author might be at fault. But if they had a reason based on their shared living, maybe not. However, in most cases, splitting equally among all present is the norm unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the standard practice and for causing a rift over a small amount.\n"
