This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves splitting an Uber cost among three people.\n\nThe author paid for a $90 Uber ride for three people. He sent a request for $45 to his friend, assuming a 50/50 split between himself and his girlfriend as one entity and the friend as another. The friend thinks it should be a third each, so $30. The author is in a dilemma because the friend isn't responding except to mention the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual practices in splitting costs. Typically, when multiple people are involved in a shared expense, the fair split is by the number of people. So three people would each pay a third. The author grouped himself and his girlfriend as one, which might be their usual practice, but in this case, the friend wasn't part of that arrangement. The friend likely expected an equal split among all three, not considering the couple as a single unit.\n\nBy charging 50/50, the author is making the friend pay more than a third. The friend's argument is that it should be $30 each. The author is holding onto the $15 difference, making a \"big deal\" out of it. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they usually split expenses between them and their girlfriend, but this situation is different because there's a third party involved. The friend wasn't part of their usual setup, so expecting him to pay a third makes sense. The author's mistake might be in not considering the friend's perspective upfront. Maybe he should have clarified the split before the ride. \n\nThe friend might feel slighted by being charged more than his fair share, especially since he's an outsider to the couple's usual arrangement. By insisting on the $15, the author is creating tension. The friend's refusal to talk unless the author drops the amount suggests that the author is being rigid. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting the cost equally among three is the standard approach. The author's method of grouping himself and his girlfriend as one could be seen as unfair to the third person. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not adjusting the split appropriately. Additionally, making a big deal about $15 could be seen as being overly concerned with a small amount, which might damage the friendship. The friend's reaction indicates that he feels the split was unfair, and the author's insistence on the money might be the bigger issue here.\n"
