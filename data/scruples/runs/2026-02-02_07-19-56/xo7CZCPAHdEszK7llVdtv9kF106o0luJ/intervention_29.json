This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost among three people. The author paid $90 for the Uber, then asked their friend to pay half ($45), but the friend thought it should be a third each. The author ended up not getting the money and the friend hasn't been in touch since, except when the author brings up the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split costs evenly, but in this case, they went to the airport with a friend. The friend joined partway, so maybe the cost isn't split equally. The Uber was called by the author, who paid the full amount and then tried to split it 50/50 with the friend. The friend thought it should be split three ways. The main issue is the difference between two ways of splitting: two entities (author and girlfriend as one) vs. three people.\n\nI need to consider common practices. Usually, when friends ride together, the fare is split based on who benefits. Since the friend joined partway, maybe he only used a portion of the ride. If the friend's destination is along the same route, the entire cost might not be his responsibility. Alternatively, if the ride was longer because of the friend, he might owe more. But in this case, the friend was picked up near the author and girlfriend, so maybe the total cost is similar to if they went alone. \n\nAnother angle: the author and girlfriend usually split their own costs, but when involving others, maybe the friend should only pay for the part he used. However, the author treated themselves as one entity and the friend as another. Splitting 50/50 would mean the friend paid half, which might be fair if the ride was shared equally. But if three people are sharing, splitting three ways would be fairer. However, the author's approach was to consider the couple as one unit, so dividing the cost between two units (couple and friend) would be 50/50. \n\nBut wait, the friend was only part of the ride for a portion. If the Uber cost $90, but without the friend, maybe it would have been $70, and with him, $90. Then the friend's share would be the difference. Alternatively, if the ride cost the same with or without him (since he joined along the way), then maybe he doesn't need to pay anything. But the author paid the full $90 and then tried to split it 50/50, which might be incorrect if the friend didn't cause an increase in the fare. \n\nAlso, the author might have assumed that since they called the Uber, they were responsible for the cost and expected the friend to contribute. But if the friend's presence didn't add to the cost, then maybe the author is overreaching by asking for half. The key here is whether the friend's participation in the ride increased the total fare. If the Uber would have cost the same whether they went alone or with the friend, then splitting the cost is tricky. But if adding the friend made the fare more expensive (e.g., because it's a larger vehicle or the ride was longer), then the friend should contribute. \n\nIn many cases, when friends join a ride, they split the cost proportionally. If the author paid the entire amount and then seeks reimbursement, it's reasonable to split based on usage. But the author's reasoning was to treat the couple as a single entity and the friend as another. That might not be the standard approach. Typically, each person would pay their share, so three people would split three ways. However, if the couple is considered a single unit (since they live together and split costs among themselves), then splitting with the friend as two entities (couple and friend) would be 50/50. \n\nThe problem is that the friend expected a third, which is a common way to split shared costs among three people. The author's approach might be seen as unfair because there are three people, so splitting three ways is more equitable. The author's insistence on a 50/50 split might be the issue here. The $15 difference is significant because the friend thinks he should pay $30 (1/3 of $90) instead of $45. The author is holding onto the $15, which might have caused the friend to cut contact. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reasoning might be flawed. They treated the couple as a single entity, but in terms of cost-sharing, each individual's share is usually considered. Since there are three people, splitting three ways is more fair. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by insisting on a 50/50 split when a third would be appropriate. The $15 difference is due to the miscalculation of the split. Hence, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
