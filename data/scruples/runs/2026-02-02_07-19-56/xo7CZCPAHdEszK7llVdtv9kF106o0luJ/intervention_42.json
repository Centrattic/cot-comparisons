This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber ride cost. The writer and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses 50/50, but in this case, there was a friend joining them. The Uber cost $90, and the writer sent a request for the friend to pay $45 (half), but the friend thought it should be 1/3, which would be $30. The writer then asks if they're in the wrong for making a big deal over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual practices. The writer and their girlfriend split things 50/50, but when the friend joined, maybe the friend expected a different split. The key point is how the ride was arranged. The writer called the Uber, so they paid first, then tried to split with the friend. The friend might feel that since there are three people, the cost should be divided equally, hence $30 each. \n\nBut the writer grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, making it two entities: the couple and the friend. In that case, splitting 50/50 makes sense. However, typically, when multiple people split a ride, the standard is to divide the cost equally per person unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The writer's approach assumes that the couple is a single unit, which the friend might not have been aware of. \n\nThe writer is now following up with a money request, which might come off as confrontational. The friend might have expected a more informal arrangement or not have agreed to the 50/50 split upfront. The writer didn't check with the friend about expectations before the ride, leading to confusion. \n\nAlso, the writer is making a big deal over $15. That's a small amount, and insisting on it could strain a friendship. The writer's approach could be seen as being too rigid about splitting costs, not considering the friend's perspective. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend was a third person, splitting three ways is more equitable. The writer's method might be seen as unfair because they grouped themselves and the girlfriend, effectively making the friend pay more than their share. \n\nAdditionally, the writer's reasoning that \"we count as one entity\" might be a stretch. While they live together and split expenses between themselves, introducing a third person into the equation changes the dynamics. The friend wasn't part of the couple's usual 50/50 agreement. \n\nSo, the writer might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's expectation of splitting three ways and for pushing for the $15 difference, which could have been resolved with a more flexible approach. The main issue is the assumption that the couple should be a single unit for splitting costs, which the friend didn't agree to. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't account for the friend's perspective and made an issue out of a small amount, potentially harming the friendship over a minor disagreement.\n"
