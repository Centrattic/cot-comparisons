This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together and called an Uber for three people. The friend's part is a mile or two away but in the direction of the airport. The total fare was $90, so the author paid and then asked the friend to pay half, which is $45, but the friend thinks it should be a third.\n\nSo, the question is whether splitting it 50/50 is wrong. The author's reasoning is that they (the couple) are considered one entity, so two entities total, hence 50/50. The friend thinks it should be split three ways because there are three people. The author is upset that the friend hasn't paid and they haven't seen each other since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of splitting the cost. Typically, when multiple people share a ride, it's common to split the cost based on the number of people. However, the author is grouping themselves with their girlfriend as one entity, which might not be standard. If the couple is living together, maybe they split costs among themselves, but when inviting a third person, that person might expect to split the total fare equally with each person. So three people would each pay a third. \n\nThe author's method of splitting as two entities (couple + friend) might be seen as unfair because the friend is being charged half, which is more than their actual share if split three ways. The friend's argument is that they should only pay a third, which is about $30. The author is asking for $45, which is a $15 difference. The author is holding onto the money because of this, which might be causing the rift.\n\nAnother point is that the author initiated the ride and included the friend. If the friend was a passenger, it's possible the author should have coordinated the payment beforehand. The author's approach of sending a request after the fact might not be the best way to handle it, especially if there was no prior agreement. \n\nAlso, the amount in question is relatively small ($15), but the fact that it's causing a friendship issue suggests that the way the author is handling it (insisting on the $45 and not dropping it) is problematic. The friend might feel that the author is being too rigid about a small amount, which could be seen as the author making a big deal out of it unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting costs should ideally be agreed upon before the expense. Since the author grouped themselves with their girlfriend as one entity, maybe that's where the misunderstanding came in. The friend likely expected a per-person split. The author's insistence on 50/50 might not consider that the friend didn't receive as much benefit from the ride\u2014since the friend's address was near the author's home and in the direction of the airport, the ride might have been mostly the author's trip with the friend getting a small portion. But the fare is still for three people. If the ride was $90, splitting three ways would be $30 each. The author's logic is two entities, so $45 each, but that might not account for the actual usage.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the friend to pay half when the friend logically expected a third. The author is also holding onto the friendship over a $15 difference, which is a small amount that shouldn't cause such a rift. The author's approach of not compromising and dropping the $15 difference is likely the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
