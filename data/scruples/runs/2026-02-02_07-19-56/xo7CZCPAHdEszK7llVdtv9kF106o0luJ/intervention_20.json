This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost.\n\nSo, the author, his girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The total was $90. The author paid and then asked the friend to pay half, which is $45, assuming a 50/50 split. The friend thinks it should be a third each since there are three people. The author is now upset because the friend won't pay the $45 and the friendship is strained over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his girlfriend live together and usually split things evenly, so they see themselves as a single unit. The friend was picked up on the way, so maybe the original plan was for the author and girlfriend to cover the ride for the friend? But the author isn't doing that now, instead splitting the cost between two entities (their couple vs. the friend). \n\nThe friend might feel that since all three people are sharing the ride, it's fair to split three ways. The problem is that the author is charging 50%, which is more than the friend's share in a three-way split. The author's reasoning is that since he and his girlfriend usually split things, they count as one, so it's 1 vs 1, hence 50/50. But is that a valid way to split costs here?\n\nIn most shared situations, unless pre-agreed otherwise, splitting equally among all participants is the norm. The author might have assumed that since the friend was a third person, but then decided to group himself and his girlfriend as one entity. However, unless the friend was aware of this arrangement beforehand, it's possible the friend expected a three-way split. The author is now holding the friend to a 50/50 split, which the friend isn't comfortable with, leading to a $15 difference (since $90 divided by three is $30 each, so the friend would only owe $30 instead of $45, hence the $15 difference the author mentions).\n\nThe key issue is whether the author's approach to splitting the cost is fair. If the friend didn't consent to a 50/50 split and expected a three-way split, then the author might be in the wrong by not considering the friend's expectation. Also, the author is making a big deal out of $15, which could be seen as being too fixated on a small amount over a friend. The fact that the author hasn't seen the friend since and continues to push for the $45 might indicate that the author is being rigid and not willing to compromise, which is a sign of being in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that since they usually split things 50/50 as a couple, grouping them as a single entity is reasonable. However, in shared situations with others, it's important to clarify the arrangement beforehand. The author didn't specify the payment terms before the ride, leading to a misunderstanding. The friend's refusal to pay $45 now is because they believe in a different split. The author's persistence in this matter might be causing unnecessary conflict, hence being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's approach to splitting the cost without prior agreement and then escalating it to a point of straining the friendship suggests that they are in the wrong. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
