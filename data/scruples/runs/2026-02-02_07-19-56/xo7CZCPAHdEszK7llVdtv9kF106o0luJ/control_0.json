This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50-50 despite three people being involved. So, the situation is that there are three people: the author, their girlfriend, and a friend. The friend was picked up on the way to the airport, and the total fare was $90. The author paid and then asked the friend to pay $45, which is half. The friend argues that it should be a third each, so $30. The author is now wondering if they're being unreasonable over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actual cost-sharing. The key point here is how the cost should be divided. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, hence 50-50 with the friend. But the friend thinks it should be split among all three, hence 1/3. \n\nI think the main issue is how the ride was arranged. The author called the Uber and paid first, which might imply that they took responsibility for the initial payment. But when splitting costs, it's common to consider who benefited from the ride. The friend was a third passenger, so technically, each person should pay a third. However, the author and their girlfriend might have considered that they were already going to the airport and the friend was just a stop along the way, which might justify a different split. \n\nBut in typical Uber cost-sharing scenarios, if three people are in the same ride, it's usually split equally. The author's approach of splitting 50-50 between their group and the third person might not be standard. The friend's argument for a third each is more equitable if all three are splitting the cost. The author might have miscalculated or assumed that the group of two counted as one entity, which isn't the usual approach. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split everything evenly might not matter in this case because the third person is separate. The main issue is that the friend is being asked to pay half, which is more than his fair share if three people are splitting. The author is now chasing the friend for $15, which seems minor but could be a point of contention. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because splitting it 50-50 isn't fair if there are three people. The correct split would be each paying a third. However, maybe the author thought that since they were already going to the airport, the friend was just adding a small portion to their ride. But Uber's pricing is based on distance and time, so adding a third person might not significantly increase the cost, but the friend is still benefiting from the ride. \n\nIn most group situations, splitting equally is the norm unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The author didn't clarify beforehand how the cost would be split, which led to the conflict. So the author's mistake was in not agreeing on the split before the ride and then enforcing a 50-50 split when a third person was involved. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for all three people.\n"
