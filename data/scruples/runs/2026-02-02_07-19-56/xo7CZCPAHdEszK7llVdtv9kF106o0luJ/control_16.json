This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost when there were three people. The author paid the full $90, then tried to split it 50/50 with the third friend. The friend thought it should be split three ways, but the author considered their girlfriend and themselves as one entity and the friend as another. Now they're arguing over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author's approach was fair. The key points here are how they grouped people. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, so maybe they see themselves as a single unit. That makes sense because they might consider their combined spending. The friend, however, is an outsider, so the author's logic is that it's two entities: them (as one) and the friend (as another). Splitting 50/50 between two entities would mean each pays half. But the friend thought it should be three ways, which would be $30 each, meaning the author and girlfriend would pay $30 and the friend $30. The author is charging $45, which is half of $90, assuming they're two people, but if they're considered as one entity, then maybe the author is wrong to split it 50/50 when there are three people. Wait, maybe the confusion is between the number of people versus the number of entities. \n\nThe author grouped themselves as one entity (two people) and the friend as another. So total two entities. So splitting the cost 50/50 makes sense between two entities. But the friend sees three people, so each should pay 1/3. The issue is whether the grouping is valid. If the author and their girlfriend are considered as a single unit, then the split is correct. However, others might argue that splitting based on the number of people is fairer, regardless of how people group their expenses. \n\nAlso, the author had called the Uber, so maybe there's an expectation that they might have covered it as a favor, but they decided to split it. The friend's refusal to pay the $15 difference and not responding might be inconsiderate. The author is holding onto this, which could be seen as making a big deal over a small amount. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they grouped their expenses as a unit. However, some could say that splitting based on the number of people is more fair. But if they agreed to split 50/50, the friend's refusal is the issue. The question is about the author's actions. If they're charging 50/50 based on their own grouping, that's their choice, but maybe the problem is not being clear beforehand. The author might be in the right if they communicated the split properly. Alternatively, the author is in the wrong if they should have considered the standard of splitting by the number of people. \n\nThe answer depends on cultural norms. Usually, splitting costs is per person unless agreed otherwise. Since the author grouped themselves as a unit, they might not be in the wrong, but the friend's expectation was different. The author making a big deal out of $15 could be unnecessary. The friend's refusal to talk unless the author drops the amount might be the bigger issue here. But the question is specifically about the author. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had their own way of grouping, but the friend's reaction is the problem. Therefore, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
