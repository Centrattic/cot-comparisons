This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves splitting an Uber ride cost among three people. The author paid for the entire ride and then asked their friend to split the cost 50/50, meaning the friend pays half ($45 out of $90). But the friend thinks it should be one-third each, which would be around $30. The author is now wondering if they're being unreasonable over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses, but in this case, they were going to the airport together. They picked up a friend who was going in the same direction. The friend's trip was separate, but they were part of the ride. The question is about splitting the cost: 50/50 (author and girlfriend as one entity) versus three people each paying a third.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether splitting 50/50 is fair. If there were three people in the car, the total cost should be divided among all three. Since the author is grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one, that might not be the case. Typically, when you have multiple people in a ride, each person contributes based on the number of people. So three people would each pay one-third. The author's approach of splitting as two entities (themselves as one, friend as another) leads to a 50/50 split, which is fair only if two people are sharing the cost. But since there are three people, splitting as two groups might not be fair to the friend.\n\nThe author's justification is that they usually split everything with their girlfriend, but in this case, they're treating it as a single entity. However, the friend might not be aware of their usual arrangement and expects each person to pay their share. The $15 difference is the key here. The author is holding the friend responsible for $45 instead of $30, which is a $15 discrepancy. The friend is unwilling to pay that extra $15, leading to strain in their friendship.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, splitting equally among all three is the standard practice when multiple people are using the same service. The author's approach of grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one entity isn't considering the friend's perspective. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expecting a 50/50 split instead of a 33% share. The $15 isn't a huge amount, but the principle is about fairness. The author's insistence on the split could be seen as being overly focused on a small amount, which might damage the friendship unnecessarily. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author has a point if they were the ones who called the Uber and took responsibility for the payment. However, in such situations, the expectation is usually that all passengers contribute equally. So the author's approach is where the issue lies. The friend is right to think it should be one-third each. Hence, the author is in the wrong by not splitting the cost among three people, making them the one at fault here.\n"
