This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. So the situation: the author and their girlfriend live together, they had a friend join their Uber to the airport. The total was $90, and the author paid and then asked the friend to split the cost 50/50, meaning $45 each. The friend thought it should be split three ways, so each paying $30. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for insisting on the $45 split, which is a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out fairness here. The author and their girlfriend are considered one entity because they live together and often split costs evenly. Adding the third person, the logic is that there are two groups: the couple and the friend. So splitting 50/50 would mean each group pays half. But maybe the friend feels that since there are three people total, each should pay a third. \n\nThe key here is whether the couple is one entity or two. If they're a couple and they usually split their own costs, they might be seen as a single unit. But in terms of actual cost calculation, if each person is an individual, then three people would each pay 1/3. However, if the couple is considered one, then two groups: the couple (as one) and the friend (as one), making it 50/50. \n\nBut here's the thing: when splitting costs among multiple people, the standard is usually per person unless otherwise specified. So each person pays an equal share. The friend probably expected each of the three to pay $30. The author's reasoning is that they're a couple and thus a single unit, but that's not typically how people handle shared expenses unless it's agreed beforehand. \n\nSo the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider that the friend might expect an equal split per person. By splitting as two groups (couple vs friend), the author is charging the friend more than a third. The $15 difference is a result of not considering the standard expectation of splitting per person count. The author made a big deal out of it by not addressing the friend's perspective and insisting on the $45. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
