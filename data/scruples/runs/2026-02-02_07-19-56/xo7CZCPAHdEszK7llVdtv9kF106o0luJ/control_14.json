This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves splitting an Uber cost when there were three people, but the author split it 50/50 between themselves and their girlfriend as one group and the friend as the other. The friend thought it should be 1/3 each.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario clearly. The author and their girlfriend live together, so they probably share expenses. They have a friend who needed to go to the airport, so they picked him up in an Uber. The total cost was $90. The author paid and then asked the friend to pay half, which is $45, but the friend expected to pay $30 (a third). The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for insisting on the 50/50 split, especially since the friend hasn't responded since the request and refuses to talk about it unless the author drops the $15 difference.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author considers themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, hence 50% each with the friend. The friend thinks it should be split three ways because there are three people. The author is holding onto the $15, which is causing a rift in the friendship.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when splitting costs among multiple people, the standard is usually to divide it equally. Since there were three people, each should contribute a third. However, the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity, so they see it as two entities (their group and the friend). That's where the 50/50 split comes from. But the friend might not see it that way, especially if the author didn't clarify this before the ride. The friend might have expected each person to pay a third, thinking it's three individuals splitting the cost.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses equally, they consider themselves as one unit. But in a shared ride scenario, unless it's established beforehand that couples or roommates will split differently, the norm is usually per person. So maybe the author didn't communicate their plan to split 50/50 with the friend beforehand, leading to the confusion. The friend might feel it's unfair because he's paying for a third of the ride himself, but the author is charging him half, which is 50% more than what he expected.\n\nAnother angle is the actual benefit each person got. The author's girlfriend didn't pay anything extra, so maybe the author is acting as a proxy for both of them, but the friend is an individual. However, in shared rides, especially when one person is facilitating the pickup, sometimes there's an unspoken understanding that the person arranging the ride might take responsibility for splitting it among all participants. But without prior agreement, the default is usually equal split per person.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend lives a mile or two away in the direction of the airport might mean that he was only adding a small part to the trip, but the total cost was $90, which is high. Maybe the author's reasoning is that their trip was longer, and the friend was just a short detour. However, the fare calculation includes the detour, so splitting equally makes sense if the detour increased the total cost.\n\nThe author is holding the friend accountable for $15, which is a significant amount for a small argument. The friend might not want to pay an extra $15 if he thought it should be a third. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't clarify the split before the ride, and the standard practice is to split equally per person unless otherwise agreed. By not addressing this beforehand, the author is now creating a problem where there was an expectation of equal sharing.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate the split in advance and are holding onto a small amount of money over a minor disagreement, causing a rift in the friendship. The friend's expectation of a third is reasonable, and the author's insistence on 50/50 without prior discussion is the issue here.\n"
