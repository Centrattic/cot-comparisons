This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. The scenario involves the author, their girlfriend, and a friend. The key points are:\n\n1. The author paid for the $90 Uber ride and then asked the friend for $45, splitting it 50/50.\n2. The friend expects to pay 1/3, which would be $30.\n3. The author justifies this by considering themselves and their girlfriend as one entity since they live together and often split costs evenly. The friend is considered the second entity.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether splitting the cost 50/50 was fair. If the author and their girlfriend are considered a single unit, then the total cost should be split between two entities (the couple and the friend), making each pay half. That logic makes sense because the couple is a shared expense, so splitting 50/50 between two groups is reasonable. \n\nHowever, the friend might see it as three individual people sharing the ride, hence each paying a third. The confusion here is whether the grouping is appropriate. The author's reasoning is that the couple's shared expenses are split between them, but in this case, since they're a couple, grouping them as one makes sense. Therefore, splitting the fare between two groups is fair. \n\nThe author isn't making a big deal out of $15; they're insisting on their initial agreement. The friend's refusal to talk about it unless the author drops the request shows that the issue is more about principle for the author. The $15 difference is significant in terms of fairness. The author, by sticking to their reasoning, might be seen as correct. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend expected all three to split equally, then the author's approach could be seen as not considering the friend's perspective. But given the author's explanation that they usually split things as a couple, it's a valid approach. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they treated their living arrangement and shared expenses as a single unit, which is reasonable. The friend's expectation of a third might not account for the couple's dynamic. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
