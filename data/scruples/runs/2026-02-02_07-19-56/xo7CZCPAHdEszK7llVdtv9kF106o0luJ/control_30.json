This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. Hmm. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend, who live together, had a flight from LAX during a busy holiday. They picked up a friend on the way to the airport. The Uber cost $90, and the author paid the whole thing and asked their friend to pay $45 (half), instead of splitting it into thirds ($30 each). The friend is upset about this, and now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the fairness of splitting the cost. The author and their girlfriend live together, so maybe they usually split things evenly between them, but in this case, they considered themselves as one entity and the friend as another. So they split it into two parts, each paying half. The friend, however, expects a third each since there were three people. \n\nThe key here is whether the author and their girlfriend should be considered one person or two when it comes to splitting the cost. If they're a couple and often share expenses, they might see themselves as a single unit. But the friend might not know that and expect each individual to pay their share. \n\nAlso, the timing matters. The author paid the whole amount and then asked for half from the friend. The friend might feel it's unfair because they're being asked to pay for two people. The author's reasoning is that they usually balance expenses between them and their girlfriend, so they treated it as a joint expense. But in this case, the friend is an outsider, so maybe the author should have considered the friend's perspective.\n\nEthically, splitting the cost among all passengers is usually the fair way. Since there were three people, each should pay a third. The author's approach of splitting into two parts assumes that they and their girlfriend are one entity, which might not be the friend's understanding. The author might have not communicated the arrangement clearly before the ride. The friend's refusal to talk about it unless the author drops the $15 suggests that the author is being rigid here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought that since they and their girlfriend often split things, they can handle it among themselves, so the friend's share is half. However, the friend might not be aware of their usual arrangement and expects the standard split. The author's insistence on $45 could come off as being inconsiderate, especially over a relatively small amount like $15. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author considered themselves as two people, then the correct split would be each person paying $30. But by splitting into two entities (author/gf as one and friend as another), it's $45 each. The confusion arises from not clarifying the arrangement beforehand. The author might be at fault for not setting clear expectations with the friend. The friend's perspective is that there were three people, so each should pay a third. The author's approach could be seen as unfair, even if they have their own way of handling expenses with their partner. Since the friend is part of the ride, they might reasonably expect to split it equally with everyone involved. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for the friend's expectation of splitting three ways. The $15 is a small amount, and being flexible here would preserve the friendship. The author's insistence on splitting two ways without prior agreement could be seen as unreasonable.\n"
