This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost.\n\nSo, the setup: the author and their girlfriend live together and are going to the airport with a friend. They picked up the friend in the same Uber, which cost $90. The author paid and then tried to split the cost 50/50 with the friend, which would be $45 each. The friend thought it should be a third each, so $30. The author is questioning if they're wrong for making a big deal over $15.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The key points are how the cost should be split. The author considers themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, so two entities total (they and the friend), hence 50/50. The friend thinks there are three people, so each pays a third. \n\nWait, the author mentions that usually, they don't split everything with their girlfriend because they end up even over time. So they're treating the two of them as one payer. But the friend is a separate person. So the logic is that the ride was shared by two entities (the couple and the friend), hence splitting 50/50. The friend, however, is looking at it as three individuals. \n\nIs the author right to consider themselves as one entity? That's the crux. In shared expenses, typically, each person pays for themselves unless there's an agreement otherwise. But the author and their girlfriend live together and might share expenses differently. However, the friend is a third party. If the author and girlfriend are paying together, but the friend is splitting with them, maybe the friend should pay for their own share. \n\nWait, the Uber was called by the author, so they paid for the entire ride. Then, they're trying to split the cost with the friend. The problem is whether the friend should pay 50% or 33%. The author's reasoning is that they (the couple) are one entity, so the friend is the other, so 50-50. The friend argues that there are three people, so each pays 1/3. \n\nBut in reality, Uber fares are based on the ride's distance and time. If the friend joined the ride, the cost would be shared proportionally based on how much of the ride they each used. But the author paid the entire $90, so they might need to calculate how much the friend actually used. However, the author might not have the exact breakdown. If the friend only used a small part of the ride, maybe they should pay less. But in this case, since the friend was picked up from a location a mile or two away from the author's place and then dropped off at the airport, maybe the friend's share is significant. \n\nBut the author's argument is that they are a couple who usually splits expenses, but in this case, they paid for the whole ride and then tried to split with the friend. The friend's argument is that there are three people, so each should pay a third. The author is holding the friend to $45, which is half, and the friend is only willing to pay $30, a third. The author is upset about the $15 difference. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, if all three people are sharing the ride and the cost is based on the ride, then each person should pay an equal share. So three people, each pays a third. However, the author and their girlfriend might have a different arrangement where they handle their own expenses between them, but when involving a third person, the third person would be responsible for their own share. \n\nThe author's mistake might be in considering themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity. If they're treating their shared expenses as a single unit, then when splitting with others, maybe they should adjust accordingly. However, if the friend is a third party, then splitting 50/50 might not be fair because the friend is only one person. So the friend being charged half the total when there are three people in total is actually charging them more than their fair share. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they should have split the cost into three equal parts, not two. The fact that the author and girlfriend live together doesn't change the fact that the third person is an individual. So the correct split would be $30 each. The author is holding the friend to $15 more than they should, which is why the friend is upset. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
