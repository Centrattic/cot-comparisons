This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for splitting the Uber fare 50/50 instead of splitting it three ways. Let's go through the details.\n\nThe situation is that the author, their girlfriend, and a friend shared an Uber ride to the airport. The author paid the total $90 fare and then tried to split it 50/50 between themselves and the girlfriend (as one entity) and the friend (as another). The friend argues that it should be split three ways, hence $30 each. The author is being asked if they're in the wrong for insisting on a 50/50 split, leading to a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common practices for splitting costs. Typically, when three people share a ride, it's split three ways. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, which makes sense since they live together and might usually cover such expenses. However, the friend might not have expected that arrangement.\n\nNext, the author called the Uber and paid first, so they might have assumed responsibility. But the friend's perspective is that they're sharing the cost equally. The key here is whether the author communicated the split beforehand. If the author didn't clarify the split before the ride, the friend might feel it's unfair to be charged half when there were three people. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their usual arrangement with their girlfriend is to split expenses eventually, but in this case, they grouped themselves as one. That might be okay, but the friend's expectation could have been different. The author's approach could be seen as not considering the friend's viewpoint, leading to a $15 dispute. \n\nIn terms of friendship, the author is trying to recover the money, and the friend is avoiding the conversation. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't set clear expectations beforehand. However, the friend might also be right in expecting a three-way split. The question is whether the author's approach was reasonable. \n\nSince the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one party, it's a bit of a gray area. But generally, when three people share a ride, it's split three ways unless otherwise agreed. The author might have miscalculated the split, leading to the friend feeling shortchanged. So the author could be at fault for not discussing the split before the ride and for insisting on a 50/50 split after the fact.\n"
