This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 instead of equally among three people.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had an Uber ride costing $90. The author and their girlfriend live together and often split expenses evenly, so they considered themselves as one entity. The third person is a friend they picked up halfway. The author paid the total and asked the friend to pay $45 (half), but the friend thought it should be a third each. Now there's a $15 difference, and the friend isn't responding.\n\nSo the main issue is whether splitting 50/50 is fair when there are three people. Normally, splitting equally among all would be 1/3 each, but the author grouped themselves and the girlfriend as a single unit. That's where the confusion comes in. The author might think that since they usually split things 50/50 between each other, it's fair to treat their combined cost as one share. But the friend probably expects each person to pay a third, regardless of their usual habits with their partner.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, maybe. They made an assumption that they and their girlfriend are a unit, but the friend wasn't part of that arrangement. Fairness usually depends on prior agreements. Since there was no prior agreement, splitting equally (each person pays a third) might be the fairer approach. The author's method could be seen as unfair because it ignores the third person's presence. The $15 is a small amount, but the problem is the method of division. By splitting 50/50, the author and their girlfriend end up paying $45 each, which is more than a third. The friend pays less than their share. However, the author might argue that since they had their own way of splitting costs, it's okay. But in the absence of prior agreement, the standard is usually equal split. So the author is in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and the standard expectation of equal sharing among all involved.\n"
