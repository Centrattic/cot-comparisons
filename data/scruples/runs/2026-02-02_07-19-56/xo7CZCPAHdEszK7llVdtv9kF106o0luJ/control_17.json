This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber ride cost. So there are three people: the author, his girlfriend, and a friend. The author paid the full $90 ride and then tried to split the cost 50/50 with his friend, which would be $45 each. But the friend thinks it should be 1/3 each, so around $30.\n\nFirst, I need to think about common practices. Usually, when you have multiple people in a ride, the fairest way is to split the cost equally. So three people would each pay a third. The author grouped himself and his girlfriend as one entity, hence the 50/50 split. But that's not accurate because the girlfriend is another person. So maybe the author is wrong here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he and his GF are a single entity, but that's just them deciding how they handle their expenses. The friend isn't part of their arrangement. So when they had the friend join, the friend is a third person. Splitting 50/50 ignores that there are three individuals. The correct split would indeed be three ways.\n\nAlso, the friend is upset about the $15 difference. The author is making a big deal out of $15, which is a significant portion for the friend. The fact that the friend hasn't reached out since and avoids discussing it unless the author drops the $15 suggests that the author's approach is causing tension. The author's insistence on splitting it 50/50 without considering the third person is where the mistake lies. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
