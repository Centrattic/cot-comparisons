This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The situation is that the author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The author paid $90 and asked the friend to pay half, $45, but the friend thought it should be a third, $30. The author thinks splitting as two entities (themselves as one and the friend as another) is fair, but the friend thinks it should be split three ways. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs usually works. If all three people are sharing the ride, the fair way is to split equally, which would be 1/3 each. But the author grouped themselves with their girlfriend as one entity, so they split as two entities. But that's not standard practice unless they were a single person. Typically, each person contributes an equal share unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. \n\nThe author called the Uber, so maybe they assumed they were splitting with two others. If they paid first and then tried to split, but the friend expected a 1/3 share, that's a conflict. The author's reasoning might be that they usually split things 50/50 with their girlfriend, but when adding a third person, that third person should only pay their share. However, the friend might not have known that the author and their girlfriend consider themselves a single unit for splitting costs. \n\nAnother angle is expectation. The friend might have assumed that since three people were in the Uber, the cost would be divided three ways. The author's approach of treating themselves and the girlfriend as one could be seen as not considering the friend's perspective. Also, the author is now making a point about the $15, which is causing tension. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the standard is equal sharing unless agreed otherwise. The author's method of splitting as two might be seen as unfair because the friend is only one person. Even if the author and girlfriend usually split things 50/50 between them, when adding a third person, the total would be three people. So splitting 50/50 between two entities (author and girlfriend as one, friend as another) would actually make the friend pay more than their fair share. For example, if the friend pays 50%, that's $45, but that's 50% of the total, not 1/3. So the friend is paying a larger portion than they should, which is why they're upset. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider that the friend expected a 1/3 share. The $15 difference is significant in this context because the author's method of splitting is not fair. The friend is correct in expecting to pay 1/3, so the author's insistence on 50/50 is the issue here.\n"
