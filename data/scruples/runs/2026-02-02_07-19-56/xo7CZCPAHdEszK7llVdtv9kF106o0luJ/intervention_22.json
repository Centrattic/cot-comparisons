This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend, who live together, offered a ride to a friend in an Uber. The Uber cost $90, and the author paid the full amount, then requested $45 from the friend. The friend argues that it should be split three ways, making it $30 each. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for making a big deal over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the different perspectives. The author considers themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity, so two entities (the couple and the friend), hence 50/50. The friend argues that since there were three people, it should be split three ways. \n\nI should consider common practices. Usually, when multiple people share a ride, the cost is split based on the number of people. So three people would split it three ways. However, if the author and their girlfriend are considered a single unit because they live together, maybe the friend thinks they should only pay for themselves. But the problem is that the author called the Uber and paid the full amount, then tried to split it 50/50. The friend might feel that since there are three people, the cost should be divided equally, making the author's approach unfair.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reasoning is that they usually split expenses equally with their girlfriend, but in this case, the friend is an outsider. The author might not have considered the friend's expectation of splitting by the number of people. The friend might have expected to pay a third because that's standard when sharing a ride with others. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting 50/50? If the friend was a third of the cost, then the author is charging them more than their fair share. The correct split would be $30 each. By charging $45, the author is essentially making the friend pay for both the author and the girlfriend's share, which isn't fair. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are one unit, so splitting 50/50. However, in shared ride situations, people usually split by the number of people. So the author's approach is not standard. The friend is correct in expecting a third. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for splitting it 50/50 instead of three ways. The $15 difference is the author's miscalculation, leading to the friend feeling it's unfair. \n\nThe author made a big deal out of $15, but the core issue is the fairness of the split. Since the standard would be a third, the author is incorrect. Hence, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
