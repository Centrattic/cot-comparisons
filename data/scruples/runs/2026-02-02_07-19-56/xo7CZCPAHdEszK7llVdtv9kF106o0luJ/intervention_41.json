This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The Uber was $90, and the author paid the full amount, then tried to get $45 from the friend. The friend thinks it should be a third, so $30. The author is now upset because the friend won't pay the $15 difference and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who is right in terms of splitting the cost. Normally, when multiple people share a ride, the fair split is based on how many people are in the car. If three people are sharing, each should pay a third. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, splitting the cost 50/50 between their group and the friend. But technically, each person should pay an equal share. Since the author and their girlfriend live together and often split costs, maybe they consider it as one unit. But the friend is a third person, so splitting into two groups might not be fair to the friend.\n\nThe author called the Uber, so they might have taken the initiative, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should pay the full amount. The friend might have expected to split three ways. The author is now chasing the $15, which is a small amount, but it's causing a rift in the friendship. The key points are fairness in splitting costs and whether the author overreacted by insisting on $15.\n\nIf the author and their girlfriend usually split things 50/50 between them, maybe they should have considered the friend as a third person. So splitting the total cost into three equal parts would be fair. The author's approach of splitting into two groups (theirself and girlfriend as one, friend as another) isn't correct because there are three individuals. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for splitting it 50/50 instead of three ways. The friend is right to think it should be a third. However, the author is also in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15 and causing a friendship issue. But the main issue is the initial split. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
