This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about splitting an Uber fare. The writer, their girlfriend, and a friend all took an Uber to the airport. The total was $90, and the writer paid and then tried to get the friend to pay half ($45). The friend thought it should be a third each. Now the writer is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how splitting costs usually works. When multiple people share a ride, the standard is to split the cost equally. In this case, there were three people. So each should pay $30. But the writer and their girlfriend are considered one entity because they live together and usually split things evenly later. So the writer split it as 50/50 between their group and the friend. The friend expected 1/3 each, which would be $30 each. The writer is now holding up the money, and the friend isn't responding.\n\nThe writer's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend act as a single unit, so it's two entities sharing the cost. The friend's reasoning is that it's three people, so each pays a third. The question is who's right. \n\nLogically, when three people split a ride, each pays a third. The writer's approach of grouping themselves and their girlfriend as one unit might be reasonable if they usually split things between themselves later, but in this case, the friend isn't part of that arrangement. So the writer's method leads to the friend paying more than their fair share (45 instead of 30). The $15 difference is the issue here. \n\nBy asking for $45, the writer is essentially charging the friend 50% of the total, which is more than the friend should pay if splitting three ways. The writer might not have considered that the friend would expect an equal split. The fact that the friend refuses to pay the $15 difference suggests that the writer is being rigid about their approach, which might have caused the friendship issue. \n\nSo, the writer's mistake was not clarifying before the ride how they wanted to split the cost. Assuming that grouping themselves and the girlfriend as one entity is valid might not be fair to the third person. The writer is now making a big deal out of $15, which could be seen as being in the wrong because they didn't set expectations upfront. The friend is in the right to expect an equal split, and the writer's insistence on a 50/50 split without discussion is causing the problem.\n"
