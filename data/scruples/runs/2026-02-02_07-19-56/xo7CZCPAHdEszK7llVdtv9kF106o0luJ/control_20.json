This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the situation is about splitting an Uber cost. The person in the question (the author) offered a ride to their friend to the airport. There were three people: the author, their girlfriend, and the friend. The Uber was $90, and the author paid for it. Then they asked the friend to pay half, which is $45, but the friend thinks it should be a third, so $30. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for making a big deal over $15.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the fairness of splitting the cost. If there are three people using the ride, the natural split would be 1/3 each. But the author considered themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, so two people in total. That's where the 50-50 split comes from. But maybe the friend saw it as three people sharing the ride, hence 1/3 each.\n\nThe key here is communication. Did the author clarify before the ride that the cost would be split 50-50? If they didn't mention it beforehand, the friend might have expected a different split. The author might be in the right if they considered their own two as one entity, but if the friend thought it was three people, then the author's approach could be seen as unfair. However, the author called the Uber, so maybe they took initiative in organizing the ride, which could justify splitting it as two parties: the couple and the friend.\n\nAnother angle: the friend lives in the direction of the airport, so maybe the ride was a convenience for the author and girlfriend, not the other way around. So the cost could be split more on the friend's part. But again, if the author arranged the ride and the friend just joined, maybe the author should cover their own part and the friend pays for their part. But the author's logic is that they split between two entities, which might be their own way of handling shared expenses.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend expected a 1/3 split and the author went for 50%, maybe the author's approach wasn't considered. However, sometimes in shared rides, people do split based on who initiated the arrangement. But since there were three people in the car, technically, all three benefited from the ride. So splitting equally as three would be fairer, but the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one, leading to a 50-50 split. The problem here is the lack of prior agreement. The author might not be in the wrong if they explained their reasoning, but if they didn't, the friend might feel it's unfair. Since the author is now trying to get $15 from the friend and the friend is upset about it, it's a social issue. The answer could depend on whether the author's approach was reasonable and communicated properly. If they didn't explain, maybe they are at fault. If they did, maybe not. But since there's no mention of prior discussion, the author might be in the wrong for not clarifying the split beforehand.\n"
