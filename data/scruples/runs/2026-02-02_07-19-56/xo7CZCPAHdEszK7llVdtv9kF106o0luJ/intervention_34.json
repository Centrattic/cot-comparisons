This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly, but in this case, a friend joined their Uber ride. The author paid the full $90 and then asked the friend for $45, splitting it 50/50 between the author's \"entity\" (themselves and the girlfriend) and the friend. The friend argues it should be a third each, so $30.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness here. The main point is how the cost should be divided. The author treated themselves and their girlfriend as one person, so two entities (themselves and the friend) leading to a 50/50 split. The friend thinks it should be three people, so each pays a third. \n\nBut wait, the author and the girlfriend live together and typically split expenses 50/50, so maybe they see their combined expenses as a shared cost. However, when splitting a ride with a third person, the standard practice is usually to split by the number of people. So three people would mean each pays a third. The author's approach groups themselves and their girlfriend as one, which might not be fair to the third person. \n\nThe friend might feel that since there are three people, each should pay a third. The author is charging half, which is $15 more than the fair share. The author is then insisting on this split, leading to tension. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems like the standard is to split by the number of people, so the author's method is incorrect. By grouping themselves and the girlfriend as one, they're effectively making the friend pay more than their fair share. The author is making a big deal over $15, which could be seen as being overly strict about a relatively small amount. \n\nThe fact that the author and girlfriend usually split 50/50 doesn't necessarily apply here because the friend isn't part of their shared living or expense arrangement. The friend was a third party who joined the ride, so the standard three-way split is more appropriate. The author's approach could be seen as inconsiderate of the friend's perspective, leading to the friend cutting off contact. \n\nSo the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because splitting the cost as 50/50 among three people isn't fair; it should be a third each. The author's method is incorrect, making them at fault here.\n"
