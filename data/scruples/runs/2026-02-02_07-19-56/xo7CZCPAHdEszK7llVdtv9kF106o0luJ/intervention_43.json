This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The friend was picked up in the Uber, and the author paid the full $90 and then asked the friend for $45, which is half. The friend thinks it should be a third each. The author is now being asked if they're at fault for making a $15 issue out of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how the cost should be split. The Uber was called by the author and their girlfriend, but the friend joined them. The ride was shared, so the total cost is split among the three. If all three are using the same Uber, it's logical that each pays a third. However, the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split things 50/50, but that's between two people. Now there's a third person. The author treated themselves and their girlfriend as one entity and the friend as another, hence 50/50. But the friend argues for 1/3 each.\n\nI think the key points here are: Was the friend a third passenger, and should that affect the split? If the ride was shared by three people, then each should pay a third. However, maybe the author and his girlfriend were the ones who needed to go to LAX, and the friend was just a piggyback. But the friend was picked up on the way to the airport, so the Uber route included his drop-off. That might mean that the friend's presence didn't add to the cost; the Uber's total might be the same whether he was there or not. So in that case, maybe splitting 50/50 is fair because the author's ride to the airport wasn't affected by the friend's presence. Wait, but the friend's presence might have increased the fare if the Uber driver had to take a different route. But the user mentioned the friend lives a mile or two away in the direction of the airport, so the driver probably just picked him up on the way without adding much distance. So maybe the total fare is roughly the same as if the author and girlfriend were alone. Therefore, the friend's addition didn't cost the author anything extra. So charging him a third would be fair if he's part of the ride. But if the ride cost the same whether he was there or not, maybe he should pay a third. Alternatively, maybe the author and girlfriend could have taken the Uber without the friend, but with the friend, the total fare is still $90. So the friend should pay half because he only used half the ride? No, that's not right. If three people are sharing a ride, each should pay a third. The author's reasoning is that they (the couple) are one entity and the friend is another, so 50/50. But that's treating two entities, not three people. The friend is an individual, so the correct split would be three parts. So the author is asking for $45, but the fair share would be $30. So the author is overcharging by $15. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for charging $45 when it should be $30. So answer A.\n"
