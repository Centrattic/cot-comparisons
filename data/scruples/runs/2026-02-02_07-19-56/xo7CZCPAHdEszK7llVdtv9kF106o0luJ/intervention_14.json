This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split costs evenly, but this time there was a friend joining them. The total Uber cost was $90. The author paid and then tried to charge the friend $45, which is 50%. The friend thought it should be $30 (a third), and now the author is upset because the friend isn't paying up.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The author's usual arrangement is with their girlfriend, splitting 50/50. But when adding a third person, the friend, the calculation changes. If three people are sharing the ride, then splitting the cost into thirds would make each pay $30. However, the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity, hence 50% each. But that's not how shared costs usually work. Typically, each person should pay an equal share regardless of how they live or their relationship status. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are a unit, but in reality, each individual should pay their own share. The friend was only responsible for their part, which is a third. The author expecting the friend to pay half might be because they considered the cost between two groups (themselves as one and the friend as another), but that's not the standard approach. Usually, it's per person. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong here because they didn't account for the third person correctly. Insisting on a 50/50 split when there are three people is unfair to the third person. The author is making a big deal over $15, which is a third of the total, but the mistake was in the initial calculation. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
