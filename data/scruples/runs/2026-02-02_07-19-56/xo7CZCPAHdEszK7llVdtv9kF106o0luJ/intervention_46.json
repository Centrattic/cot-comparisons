This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The author paid the full fare and then tried to get half from the friend, arguing that the author and their girlfriend are one entity, so it's two entities splitting the cost. The friend thinks it should be a third each. The author is now being asked if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The Uber ride cost $90. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses about even, so they consider themselves as one unit. The third person is a friend who joined the ride. The author paid the full fare, then asked the friend for $45, which is half. The friend argues it should be a third ($30 each), since there are three people. The author is now in a situation where the friend isn't paying the $15 difference, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points here are: how expenses are divided when multiple people share a ride. Typically, splitting the cost evenly among all passengers is standard. However, the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one unit, so they split it as two units. The friend, being the third, thought it should be three parts. \n\nIs there a standard practice here? Usually, when multiple people share a ride, each person pays based on the number of passengers. So three people would each pay a third. However, if the author and their girlfriend already split their own expenses and consider themselves as one unit, maybe they have an existing arrangement. But when bringing in a third person, it's possible the friend expected everyone to pay their own share. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that their unit (two people) plus the friend (one person) makes two units, hence splitting 50/50. But in reality, the ride included three people. The cost is split based on the number of people using the service. So if the ride was for three people, the cost should be divided among three, each paying a third. The author's calculation assumes their unit is one, which might be their internal arrangement, but the third person isn't part of that unit. \n\nSo, the author is trying to charge the friend half of the total fare, which is more than what the friend would pay if splitting three ways. The friend is right to think it's a third. The author's mistake was not considering that the third person is an individual passenger, so splitting it 50/50 (treating their unit as one person) is incorrect. The correct way would be three people splitting the cost, so each pays a third. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not splitting the cost among three people. They should have charged the friend $30, not $45. The $15 difference is the author's error, so they are in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
