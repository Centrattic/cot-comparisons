This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. \n\nFirst, the setup: Three people\u2014author, his girlfriend, and a friend\u2014shared an Uber ride. The total cost was $90. The author paid it all and then asked the friend for $45, splitting the cost equally between two groups: himself and his girlfriend as one entity, and the friend as another. The friend argued it should be a third each ($30). The author is now wondering if he's wrong for insisting on the $45 split, leading to a $15 difference.\n\nSo, the main question is about fairness in splitting costs when multiple people are involved. The author's reasoning is that since he and his girlfriend live together and often split expenses evenly, they count as one unit. Therefore, two units (them and the friend) each paying half makes sense. But the friend thinks it should be three people, each paying a third.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, when multiple people share a ride, it's common to split the cost equally per person unless there's an agreement otherwise. In this case, there are three people, so each should pay a third. The author's approach of grouping himself and his girlfriend as a single unit might not be standard. Even though they might split expenses between themselves 50/50, when it comes to others, the standard is usually per person. So, expecting the friend to pay a third is the norm, and charging half might be seen as unfair because the friend is only responsible for their own share. \n\nThe author is now holding onto the $15 difference, which is causing tension. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by insisting on the 50/50 split. The key factors here are: 1) whether splitting by number of people is the expected practice, and 2) whether the author's logic of grouping with his girlfriend is valid in this context. If the standard is splitting per person, then the author's approach is incorrect, making him at fault. However, if there was prior agreement or understanding that the friend would pay half, then maybe not. But since the friend didn't agree to that, the author's insistence might be the issue. The $15 might seem trivial, but the principle of fair splitting is at play here. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't follow the standard practice of splitting per person.\n"
