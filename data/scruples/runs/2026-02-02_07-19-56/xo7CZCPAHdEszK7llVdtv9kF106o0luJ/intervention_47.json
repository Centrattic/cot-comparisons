This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting an Uber ride cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people involved. The Uber was $90, and the author paid the full amount, then asked the friend for $45 (half), while the friend thought it should be split three ways. The author thinks splitting 50/50 is fair because they live together and usually split things evenly, considering themselves as one entity, and the friend as another. The friend is upset about the $15 difference and hasn't responded to the author's attempts to discuss it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if splitting the cost 50/50 is fair when there are three people. The main point is the fairness of the split. The author argues that since they and their girlfriend live together and typically split costs evenly, they count as a single unit. The friend, however, thinks each person should pay a third. \n\nBut wait, the friend was picked up on the way to the airport, so maybe the ride wasn't for the entire distance the author and girlfriend needed. The author might have covered the friend's portion of the ride, but the total cost includes the author's trip to the airport plus the friend's drop-off. However, the exact circumstances of the route aren't clear. If the author's ride to the airport was longer than the friend's, then splitting equally might not be fair. The friend might be paying for a longer trip than they actually took. But the problem statement doesn't mention that, so maybe the author should have considered the friend's contribution to the total distance.\n\nAnother angle is the initial arrangement. The author offered to pick up the friend, but there's no mention of discussing payment beforehand. The author assumed they would split the cost, but the friend might have expected a different arrangement. Since the author called the Uber and paid for it first, then asked for half, the friend might feel it was sudden or not discussed. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they treat their shared expenses as one unit, so two units (the couple and the friend) would split 50/50. But the friend seeing it as three individuals would expect a third. The difference is in how they perceive the group. If the author and girlfriend are a combined unit, then splitting the cost between two units (couple and friend) makes sense. However, the friend might not agree with that grouping, thinking of it as three separate people. \n\nThe $15 in question is a small amount, but it's causing a rift. The author is trying to recover the money, which the friend refuses unless the author drops the $15. The friend's refusal to discuss unless the author concedes suggests that the friend is hurt by the author's insistence. If the author had approached it differently, maybe they could have resolved it without conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for not clarifying the payment arrangement beforehand. It's possible that the author assumed it would be 50/50 without considering the friend's perspective. Alternatively, the friend might be inconsiderate for not discussing it either. The key here is whether the author's approach was fair given the circumstances. \n\nIf the ride was split equally in distance or time, then 50/50 might not be fair. But if the friend's portion was a small part, maybe the author should have charged less. However, the problem doesn't specify the ride's details. So, the main issue is the disagreement on splitting the cost. The author's reasoning is based on their household unit, but the friend sees it as three individual people. \n\nIn many group cost scenarios, splitting equally is common unless otherwise stated. However, when there's a pre-existing arrangement (like roommates splitting utilities), that's different. Here, the author didn't have a prior agreement with the friend. The author might have been wrong to assume 50/50 without discussing it first. The friend's expectation of a third is reasonable if they consider it a shared expense among three people. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering that the friend might expect a different split and insisting on their own method, leading to a conflict over a minor amount. The answer is A.\n"
