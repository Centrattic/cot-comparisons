This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about splitting an Uber cost. The author paid $90 for an Uber ride for three people but asked their friend to pay $45, which is half. The friend thinks they should each pay a third, which is about $30. The author is wondering if they're at fault for making a $15 issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses evenly but don't always split everything. This time, they had a friend join them on the ride. The author called the Uber and paid first, then tried to split it 50/50 with the friend. But the friend argues it should be three ways. \n\nSo the main question is whether splitting it half is fair. If there are three people, the logical split would be each paying a third. But the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, hence 50/50. But the friend is a single person. That's where the confusion arises. \n\nThe author might have thought since they were a couple sharing expenses, they should be considered one paying entity. However, the friend is a third person, so splitting into two parts (50/50) would make the friend pay more than their fair share. The friend is correct in thinking it should be three ways. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't consider that the friend is an individual. The problem is that the author treated their two-person household as one, leading to a 50/50 split, but the friend is just one person. So the author might be in the wrong because the fair split for three people is each paying a third. The author is charging $45 instead of $30, which is $15 extra. \n\nHowever, maybe there's another angle. If the Uber was called by the author, perhaps there's an assumption that the couple was responsible for the ride, so the friend is just a passenger. But even then, if the ride is shared by three people, splitting the cost three ways is standard. The author's approach might be seen as unfair because the friend is being charged more than their share. \n\nThe author is making a big deal out of $15, which isn't a huge amount, but the principle is about fairness. If the author had considered the friend as a separate person, splitting three ways would be more just. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not splitting it three ways and for making a bigger issue out of a small amount. \n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
