This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 with a friend when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together and had a flight out of LAX during a busy holiday. They picked up a friend on the way, so three people in total. The ride cost $90, and the author paid and then asked the friend to pay half, which is $45. The friend thinks it should be a third, around $30, instead. The author is wondering if they're being unreasonable by making a $15 issue.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the standard way of splitting such costs. Typically, when multiple people share a ride, the cost is split based on how many people are in the car. So if three people are in the Uber, each should pay a third. However, the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses, but in this case, they considered themselves as one entity because they're a couple and split the cost with the friend. So they split it 50/50 between the couple and the friend, leading to the friend paying $45.\n\nThe main question is whether splitting 50/50 is fair. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are a single unit, so two units (the couple and the friend). But if you consider each individual, it's three people. The author's friend is arguing for a 1/3 share, which would be $30. The author is holding out for $45, which is a $15 difference. The user is asking if the author is at fault for making a big deal out of $15.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and common practices. Usually, splitting by the number of people is standard. But sometimes, couples might consider themselves as one when splitting with others. However, in most cases, especially when it's a shared expense, each person pays their own share. The author paid for the entire $90, so they are out of pocket and want to be reimbursed. If the friend is only paying half, that's $45, but since there are three people, maybe each should pay $30. \n\nThe author's approach might be seen as a bit of a stretch because even though they live together, when splitting with a third person, each person should contribute equally. The friend's argument is that he's just one person, so they should each pay a third. The author is expecting half because they consider their two as one, but that's not typical. So, the author might be in the wrong for not splitting it into three parts. But the user is asking if they're in the wrong for making a big deal about the $15 difference. \n\nThe key here is intent. The author might have thought it was fair to split 50/50 with the friend, but the friend feels it's 1/3. The author is insisting on the $15, which could be seen as being overly focused on the money rather than the fairness of the split. However, the author is also out of pocket $90, so wanting to get half back is reasonable if they consider themselves as a single unit. But the friend's perspective is that each person should pay an equal share. \n\nAnother angle: the author and girlfriend might have a different arrangement where they usually split their own expenses, but when including a third person, maybe they should still split by the number of people. If they usually cover each other's expenses, but in this case, the friend is a separate person, then splitting three ways is more equitable. The author's method would mean the couple is covering the friend's share, which might not be fair to them if they typically split their own costs. \n\nBut the author is asking if they're in the wrong for making a big deal about $15. The friend hasn't responded since the request, and the author is holding out unless the friend accepts the $15 difference. That could be seen as being too rigid. The author might be right in their initial calculation but being too inflexible. The friend might feel it's an unfair share. However, the author's reasoning could be that they are the primary ones using the Uber (to the airport for their flight) and the friend is just a stop along the way. But the friend's argument is that he's using the same portion of the ride, maybe even the majority since he lives closer. \n\nWait, the friend lives just a mile or two away in the direction of the airport. So the ride cost is likely higher because the author and girlfriend had to go to the airport, which is farther. The friend's part might be a small portion of the total fare. So maybe splitting by the number of people isn't the only factor here. The distance each person travels could also matter. If the friend's part is minimal compared to the author and girlfriend's longer trip, maybe the author's approach is more reasonable. But Uber's pricing might not be that straightforward because stopovers and detours can affect the cost. \n\nThe author paid the full amount, so they might want to be reimbursed for the cost they incurred. If the friend was just a stop along the way, the author's share might actually be more than half, but the author is taking 50/50. The friend's argument is that since he's one person, he should pay a third. The author's reasoning is that they and their girlfriend are a couple and they usually split their own expenses, so when splitting with the friend, they count as one. \n\nIn most cases, splitting by the number of people is standard, unless there's a clear difference in the distance each person travels. The fact that the friend is only a mile or two away might mean his portion of the ride is much shorter, but Uber charges for the entire ride including the detour. So if the author and girlfriend's fare was $90 with the friend, maybe without him it would have been cheaper. The author might be overpaying because of the detour to pick him up. \n\nBut the author's question is whether they're in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15. The friend might feel the correct split is $30, and the author is holding out for $45. The author is perhaps being too insistence on the $15, especially if the friend is only responsible for a small part of the total cost. Alternatively, the author might feel that since they paid the full amount, splitting 50/50 is fair. \n\nSo, considering typical splitting norms and the fact that the friend's share is only a small part of the total trip, the author might be in the right to ask for $45, but if the friend truly only used a third of the ride, then $30 is fair. The author might be right to want their share, but the friend's refusal to discuss it after being asked might be the real issue. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author considered the couple as one entity, that's a valid approach if they usually share expenses. However, the friend's argument is that he's only one person. So the fairest way is to split by the number of people, which would be three. The author is splitting it as two, which is incorrect. The $15 difference is a third of the total fare, so if the author is expecting half, that's not fair. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for splitting it 50/50 instead of 1/3. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for making a big deal about the $15. \n\nThe answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the initial split was incorrect. But the user's question is about the reaction to the $15 difference. If the author's split was wrong, then their insistence on the $15 is unwarranted. So, the author is in the wrong for the initial split and the follow-up action. Hence, answer A.\n"
