This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves splitting an Uber cost between three people.\n\nSo, the person called an Uber for themselves, their girlfriend, and a friend. The total was $90, and they sent the friend $45, expecting a 50/50 split between their \"entity\" (them and their girlfriend) and the friend. The friend thought it should be a third each. The author is now upset that the friend isn't paying the $45 and is holding a grudge over $15.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is how the costs should be divided. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one, so 50/50. But there are three people, so maybe it's supposed to be three shares. The friend's argument is that each person should pay a third. The author's reasoning is that they're a couple living together and usually split things, but maybe that's not a valid grouping when three people are involved.\n\nWait, but the friend didn't contribute anything. If the author and their girlfriend were going to the airport anyway and picked up the friend along the way, maybe the friend's share should be based on the portion of the ride they took. But the problem is, the author didn't mention that. The friend might have assumed he was splitting equally with two people. Also, the author paid the full amount and then tried to split it, which could be seen as taking initiative but maybe not explaining clearly.\n\nThe author is now upset about a $15 difference. That's a small amount, and holding a grudge over it could damage a friendship. The other person might feel that since the ride was for three people, each should pay a third. So $30 each. The author is charging $45, expecting the friend to pay half, which would be $45 out of $90 total. That's an issue because the total is three people, so each should pay a third. So the author is technically wrong in expecting 50/50. The friend is correct to pay a third. But the author is now making a big deal out of $15, which is a small amount. \n\nSo the answer is AITA for the author? Well, if they're wrong in the split, then they are in the wrong. But they might be right if the ride was primarily for their two and the friend was just a lift. But the friend wasn't part of their original trip. The author's reasoning is that they grouped themselves as one, but that's not fair to the third person. So the correct split should be three people, each paying a third. The author is in the wrong for expecting a 50/50 split. However, the amount is small, and maybe the author shouldn't be making a big deal out of it. But the actual error is in the split calculation. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
