This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. The situation is that they, their girlfriend, and a friend shared an Uber to the airport, which cost $90. The author paid the full amount and then asked the friend for $45, which is half, but the friend thinks it should be a third. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common practices for splitting shared expenses. Typically, if three people are sharing a ride, the fare should be split three ways. However, the user mentions that they usually split costs with their girlfriend, so they considered themselves as one entity. That might be a key point. If they and their girlfriend usually share expenses 50/50, then maybe they treated themselves as a single unit. But the friend was a third person, so splitting 50/50 between the couple and the friend would mean each pays $45. But the friend expected a third, which would be about $30 each. \n\nThe author is holding out for $45, which is a $15 difference. The question is whether the author is wrong to make a big deal about that $15. The friend might feel that the author is being greedy or not considering the actual number of people. On the other hand, the author might think that since they paid for the entire ride and their usual arrangement with their girlfriend is to split everything 50/50, treating the friend as another entity makes sense.\n\nI need to check if splitting 50/50 is reasonable here. If the couple is considered one unit, then two units (couple and friend) splitting the cost would be fair. So the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the friend probably expected a third because there were three individuals. The author might not realize that the friend saw it as three people, not two units. The problem arises from different perspectives on how to count the people involved. \n\nIn terms of friendship, the $15 might be a small amount, but the issue is more about principle. The author is being firm, and the friend is unwilling to meet halfway. The author is trying to get their money back, which isn't wrong, but maybe the approach could have been different. Maybe a compromise of $30 each (total $60) and the author keeps $30, but they insisted on $45. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend expected a third, then the author's 50/50 split is not fair from the friend's perspective. However, the author's reasoning based on their usual arrangement with their partner might be valid. But in most cases, when three people split a ride, it's split three ways. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's expectation. The key is that the author didn't clarify before the ride how they would split the costs. The friend might have thought it was three people, not two units. So, the author's mistake was not setting clear expectations beforehand.\n"
