This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) who split the Uber costs 50/50 among two people instead of three is in the wrong. The situation is that there were three people in the Uber: the author, his girlfriend, and a friend. The author paid the full $90 fare and then tried to get the friend to pay half, which is $45. The friend argues that he should only pay a third, which would be $30, making the total $60 from the author's side.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and expectations. The author and his girlfriend live together and usually split expenses between themselves, but in this case, they're treating themselves as one entity (since they split everything already) and the friend as another. So they split the cost 50/50 between the two entities. The friend, however, might expect a different distribution because there are three people in total. \n\nFrom a mathematical standpoint, splitting three people would mean each should pay a third, so the friend would owe $30. But the author and girlfriend are grouping themselves as one, so splitting between two groups would be 50% each. The problem arises from differing expectations. The author might not see the issue because they see it as two groups, but the friend sees it as three individuals. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend didn't ask to be picked up, so he might feel it's unfair to charge him. However, the author did offer the ride, so maybe there's an implied expectation of splitting costs. The $15 difference isn't huge, but the author is making a big deal out of it, which could strain the friendship. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation here since it's a social agreement. Ethically, it depends on the social norms of the group. If the author usually splits expenses with the girlfriend, treating them as one entity is reasonable. But the friend might not have expected that. The author's insistence on getting the $15 could be seen as being petty, especially if it's causing a rift. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (author in the wrong) because the friend's perspective is valid if considering three people, and the author's approach might be seen as not accounting for that. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if the grouping is agreed upon. But since the friend didn't agree to the 50/50 split, the author's insistence could be wrong. Hmm, tricky.\n"
