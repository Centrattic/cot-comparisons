This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves splitting an Uber cost.\n\nSo the setup: The author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The ride cost $90. The author paid and then asked their friend to pay half, $45. The friend thought it should be 1/3, so $30. The author is now questioning if they're in the wrong for insisting on the 50/50 split, which is a $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reasoning on both sides. The author considers themselves and their girlfriend as a single entity since they live together and usually split expenses even. So they see it as two entities: themselves and the friend. Hence, splitting the cost equally between those two entities. The friend, however, argues that there are three people, so each should pay a third. \n\nIs there a standard way to split such costs? Typically, when multiple people share a ride, the cost is divided by the number of people. But in this case, the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one because they split their expenses among themselves. That's a common practice for couples. However, the friend might not have been aware of their arrangement and expected each person to pay their own share. \n\nSo the core issue is whether grouping the author and their girlfriend as a single entity is reasonable. The author's logic is that they handle their expenses internally, so the friend's contribution is based on the number of \"units\" or entities. The friend's perspective is that each individual should pay equally, hence three people. \n\nThe question is about fairness. If the author had explicitly discussed the split before the ride, maybe the outcome would be different. But since the author paid the full amount and then sent a request for half, the friend might feel it's unfair. The author is now in a situation where the friend isn't responding, and the issue is causing tension. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author didn't clarify the split before the ride, leading to a misunderstanding. While their reasoning might seem logical to them, the friend's expectation was different. In such cases, splitting by the number of people is more standard unless otherwise agreed. The author's approach might be seen as less fair because the friend was only responsible for their own share, not a shared entity. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective and not setting clear expectations beforehand. The $15 might seem small, but the principle is about fairness and respect for others' expectations. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they imposed their own grouping without prior agreement, leading to a conflict.\n"
