This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber cost 50/50 instead of 1/3 when there were three people. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together, and they picked up a friend for an Uber ride to the airport. The total was $90, and the author paid the full amount and then asked their friend to pay half. The friend argued that it should be a third. Now, the author is wondering if they're at fault for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common practices in such situations. Typically, when multiple people are in a ride, the cost is split among them. However, the number of people can be a point of debate. The author and their girlfriend live together, so maybe they consider themselves a single unit. But the friend is a third person. So, splitting 50/50 would mean the author and his girlfriend as one entity paying half, and the friend paying half. That would technically mean the friend is paying half when there are three people, which is more than a third. \n\nThe friend's argument is that since there are three people, each should pay a third. That would be around $30 each. The author is charging $45, which is half of $90, so the friend is being asked to pay more than his share if we consider three people. The author's logic is that they and their girlfriend are considered one unit, making it two units to split. But maybe the friend didn't agree to that. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectation. If the author didn't clarify before the ride how they wanted to split the cost, then the friend might have expected a third. Also, the author took the initiative to pay first and then sent a payment request, which might come off as abrupt, especially if the friend wasn't expecting to pay half. The author might have been too quick to assume how the cost should be split without discussing it beforehand. \n\nAnother angle is the amount in question. $15 isn't a huge sum, but it's causing a rift in the friendship. The author is making a point about $15, which could be seen as being too rigid. Friends often overlook small amounts for the sake of the relationship. The friend might feel that the author is being petty, while the author feels justified in splitting the cost as they see fit. \n\nLegally, there's no right or wrong here, but socially, splitting costs among friends often relies on mutual agreement. Since the author and their friend didn't agree on the split beforehand, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective. Also, the fact that the friend is avoiding the issue suggests that the author's approach might have been too forceful. Maybe the author should have been more flexible or discussed it after the ride without immediately sending a payment request. \n\nIn conclusion, while splitting costs can be subjective, the author's approach might have been insensitive to the friend's viewpoint. The friend's expectation was a third, and the author's insistence on half without prior agreement could be seen as the wrong move. The author might be in the wrong here for not communicating better and being too rigid over a small amount.\n"
