This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 when there were three people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their girlfriend live together and usually split expenses, but they end up even in the long run. They called an Uber for three people, paid the full $90, and then asked their friend to split it 50/50 (so $45 each). The friend argues it should be a third each, which would be $30. The author is holding onto this $15 difference, which is causing tension.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is how to fairly split the cost. If there are three people sharing the ride, the fairest way would be to divide the total by three. That's $30 each. So the author is charging their friend $45 instead of $30. The author grouped themselves with their girlfriend as one entity, but since they live together and probably already split expenses, maybe charging the friend 50% isn't fair because the couple's combined share would be $45, but the friend is only using part of the ride. Wait, but the friend is going in the direction towards the airport and just a mile or two away, so maybe he's only using a small part of the ride? Wait, no, the Uber was called by the author, picked up the friend on the way to the airport, and all three went together. So the total cost was $90. If all three were sharing the entire ride, splitting equally would be fair. The author's logic is that they and the girlfriend are one entity, so the friend pays half. But maybe that's not the case because the friend is a third person. \n\nThe author is in the wrong because splitting 50/50 when there are three people is unfair. The correct split would be each person paying a third. The author is asking for $45 instead of $30, so they're charging the friend more than their fair share. The $15 difference is the problem here. Even though the author and the girlfriend live together, the friend is a separate person. So the author is being unreasonable by not splitting it into three. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
