This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about splitting an Uber cost. The author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The total was $90, and the author paid it upfront. They offered to pick up the friend on the way, and now the author wants to split the cost 50/50 between their household (themselves and the girlfriend) and the friend. So they each pay $45. But the friend thinks it should be split three ways, which would be $30 each. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for insisting on the 50/50 split instead of 1/3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about fairness. The friend was a third person in the Uber, so technically they all used the same ride. So splitting the cost equally three ways would be $30 each. The author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one entity, which might not be fair because the friend is a separate person who also benefited from the ride. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author and their girlfriend usually split everything 50/50 anyway, so they might consider themselves a single unit. However, the friend didn't know that beforehand. When they offered to give the friend a ride, maybe it was a kindness, and the expectation was that the friend would split the cost based on the number of people. So the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's perspective. \n\nAlso, the amount is only $15. Insisting on this split might be seen as being too strict over a small amount. Maybe the author should have been more flexible, especially since the friend is unwilling to talk about it unless the author drops the $15. That could imply that the author is causing unnecessary tension over a minor issue. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend agreed to ride with them knowing the cost, maybe the author is right to expect some contribution. But splitting it three ways is fair if all three used the ride. The author's approach effectively charges the friend more than if it were split three ways. Wait, no: splitting 50/50 between two people would be $45 each, but the friend is being charged $45 for using the ride, while the author and girlfriend are splitting $45 between themselves. So actually, the friend is paying the same as the author's share, but the author's share is split between two. So the friend ends up paying more than if it were split three ways. So maybe the author is charging the friend a higher proportion. \n\nYes, that makes sense. If it's split three ways, each person pays $30. The author's arrangement has the friend paying $45, while the author and girlfriend split $45, which is $22.50 each. So the author is effectively getting a better deal. The friend is paying more than their fair share. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not splitting the cost fairly. The correct way would be to split it three ways. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
