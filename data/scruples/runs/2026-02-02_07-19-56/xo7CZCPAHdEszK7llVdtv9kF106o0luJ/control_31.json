This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for splitting an Uber cost 50/50 among three people. The situation is that the couple usually splits everything evenly, but in this case, they have a friend joining them. The Uber was $90, and they offered to split it 50/50 between the two of them and the friend, expecting the friend to pay $45. But the friend thinks it should be one-third each, around $30. The author is now questioning if they're at fault for making a big deal out of $15.\n\nHmm. So the main point here is whether splitting the cost 50/50 is fair when there are three people. Typically, when multiple people share a ride, the cost is divided based on the number of passengers. So three people would each pay a third. But the author's usual practice is splitting things 50/50, maybe because they live together and balance expenses that way. However, in this case, the third person is a friend, not part of their shared living arrangement. \n\nWait, the author paid for the entire Uber and then tried to get their friend to pay half. The friend thinks it should be a third. The author is considering if they're wrong for insisting on $45 instead of $30. The question is if the author is in the wrong for making a big deal out of $15.\n\nI need to think about fairness in splitting costs. If the friend only used part of the ride, maybe? But the friend was going in the same direction to the airport, so the entire cost was incurred for all three. So the standard would be to split the total fare by three. The author and girlfriend are treating themselves as a single entity, hence 50/50 between their joint account and the friend's. But that's not the usual way; splitting by the number of people is more common. \n\nIf the author and their girlfriend normally split things 50/50, maybe they consider their joint expenses as shared, but adding a third person as a separate entity. So, they might have thought the friend should cover half the cost of the ride, which would be $45 if they see themselves as one and the friend as another. But that's two entities, not three people. So the friend is arguing that it's three people, so $30 each. \n\nIs the author's approach fair? If the couple is considered as a single unit, maybe they should have explained that their usual 50/50 is between the two of them, and the friend's share should be a third. But since the author paid the entire $90 and is now trying to get their friend to pay half, that's effectively making the friend pay $45, which is more than a third. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they should have split the cost among three people, not two. The $15 difference is a result of an unfair split. The friend's perspective is that they're a third person, so they should contribute a third. The author's mistake was not considering the friend as a separate individual, but as part of a two-person split. Therefore, the author is at fault for not splitting it into thirds, making the friend pay more than their fair share. The $15 might seem small, but the principle of fairness matters here. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
