This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting Uber costs 50/50 among three people. The situation is that the author, their girlfriend, and a friend took an Uber to the airport. The author paid the $90 fare and asked the friend to pay $45, splitting it 50/50 between the two of them. The friend thought it should be a third each, about $30. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for insisting on the $15 difference.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the math. If there were three people, each should pay a third. So $90 divided by 3 is $30 each. The author and their girlfriend are considered one entity, so they paid for the whole ride and then asked the friend for half. But if they're two people, that's two entities. Wait, the original question says the author and girlfriend live together and usually split things evenly, so they're treating themselves as one unit. So maybe they combined their costs and split with the third person. But that's where the confusion comes in.\n\nThe friend argues that since there are three people, each should pay a third. The author's reasoning is that since they and their girlfriend are a single unit (because they split costs evenly between them), that makes two units: the couple and the friend. So 50/50 between two units would mean each unit pays $45. But the friend thinks it's three people, so $30 each. The author is holding out for the $15 difference, which is making the friend not want to talk unless the author drops it.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the friend considers that there are three individuals, then each should pay $30. But the author and their girlfriend might see themselves as one unit because they share expenses. However, when splitting costs with others, it's usually per person unless otherwise stated. The author assumed the friend would pay half, but the friend expected a third. The author's approach might be seen as not considering the friend as an individual, which could be why the friend is upset. The $15 is a small amount, but the author is making a big deal out of it, which could strain the friendship. So, maybe the author is being unreasonable by not compromising or considering the friend's perspective. The answer might be A, but I need to check if the initial reasoning is correct. Alternatively, if the couple is considered one unit, then splitting 50/50 is fair between two units. But in Uber rides, typically, if you have three people, the cost is split per person. So maybe the author is wrong in assuming 50/50 instead of per person. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
