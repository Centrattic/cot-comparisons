This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 among three people. The scenario is that the author and their girlfriend called an Uber to the airport, picked up a friend along the way, and then tried to split the $90 fare equally. The friend thought it should be a third each, but the author and their girlfriend considered themselves as one entity, so half each. Now the friend is upset and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The key points are: three people, the ride cost $90, the author paid the full amount and tried to get the friend to split 50/50. The friend thought it should be divided by three. The author argues that since they live together, they're a single unit, hence two entities (them and the friend), making it 50/50. The friend disagrees and the author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is splitting the cost. The author's reasoning is that they are a couple sharing expenses, so their friend should pay half. The friend's perspective is that since there are three people, each should pay a third. The author sent a request for $45 (half), but the friend thought it should be $30 (a third). The $15 difference is the point of contention.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, splitting costs can be subjective based on context. The author's justification is that they are a couple, so maybe they usually share expenses between themselves and consider it as one unit. However, when inviting a third person, it's customary to split based on the number of people involved. So if three people are using the service, the cost is typically divided by three. The author's approach of treating themselves as one entity might not be the norm here. \n\nIn many situations, when you have a group, you split the cost equally among all participants unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The fact that the author and their girlfriend usually split things between themselves doesn't necessarily extend to a third party. The friend might have expected the standard three-way split. By splitting it as 50/50, the author is charging the friend more than the friend anticipated (since a third is cheaper than half). \n\nAdditionally, the author initiated the ride, so perhaps they had the responsibility to clarify how the cost would be split beforehand. The friend might have assumed that everyone would split equally since three people were involved. The author's approach could be seen as not considering the friend's perspective and expecting them to pay a higher share without prior discussion.\n\nThe $15 might seem small, but the issue is about fairness and expectations. The author's insistence on dropping the $15 difference to resolve the issue might also come across as not being willing to compromise, which could strain the friendship. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered fair to split the cost equally among all participants unless there's a specific reason to do otherwise. The author's reasoning that they should be considered as one entity is a bit unconventional in this context. If the couple had paid for the ride themselves without involving the friend, that would be different. But since they included the friend in the ride, the friend might reasonably expect to pay a third. \n\nTherefore, the author's approach might be seen as the wrong one because they didn't split the cost based on the number of people involved, leading to the friend's discomfort and the subsequent strain on the friendship. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
