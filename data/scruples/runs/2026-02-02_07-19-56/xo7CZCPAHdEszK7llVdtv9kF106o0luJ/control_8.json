This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for splitting a $90 Uber ride 50/50 between themselves and a friend, even though there were three people total (the author, their girlfriend, and the friend). The author paid the full amount and then asked the friend for $45, which is half of the total. The friend argues it should be a third each, so $30. The author is now wondering if they're at fault for this $15 difference.\n\nFirst, the key point here is how the cost should be split. If there are three people, the fair split would typically be each person paying a third. However, the author mentions that they live with their girlfriend and usually split expenses 50/50, considering themselves as one entity. So they grouped themselves together as two people, leading to a 50/50 split with the friend. But the friend expected a third each. \n\nThe problem arises from differing expectations. The author probably assumed that since they and their girlfriend are a unit, the friend would cover half. The friend, on the other hand, thinks it's three separate people, so each should pay a third. The author's approach might not have been clearly communicated, leading to confusion. \n\nAlso, the author sent a payment request for $45 without prior agreement. The friend might feel it was unfair to be asked for half without discussion. Even though the amount is small ($15), the issue is about fairness and communication. The author might be at fault for not discussing the split beforehand and for insisting on their method despite the friend's objection. \n\nHowever, considering that the friend lives near the author's direction to the airport, maybe the ride would have cost more if the friend wasn't there. So splitting 50/50 could be seen as the friend saving money by sharing. But the author didn't account for the third person. \n\nIn summary, the main issue is lack of communication and differing assumptions. The author's approach isn't necessarily wrong, but they could have been more considerate by discussing the split upfront. Since they're the one who called the Uber and initiated the payment, they might have a responsibility to handle the split fairly. The friend's refusal to talk unless the author drops the $15 is also a problem, but the question is about the author's fault. The author's insistence on 50/50 without prior agreement might be seen as the issue here. So the answer is likely A (author is at fault).\n"
