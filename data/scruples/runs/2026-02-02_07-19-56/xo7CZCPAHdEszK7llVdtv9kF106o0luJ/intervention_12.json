This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   AITA for making a big deal out of $15?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves splitting an Uber cost among three people. The author, their girlfriend, and a friend. The total was $90, and the author paid and then asked the friend for $45, splitting it 50/50 between their group (the author and girlfriend) and the friend. The friend argues it should be split three ways, so $30 each. The author thinks they're a single entity, hence 50/50.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how such splits usually work. Typically, when multiple people are in a ride, the cost is divided by the number of people. So three people would split into thirds. However, the author grouped themselves and their girlfriend as one unit, which might not be the standard approach. The friend might expect each individual to split the cost, not combining their own relationship. \n\nThe key here is the expectation. Did the author and friend agree beforehand on how to split the cost? Since they didn't, the friend might have assumed it's three people, each paying a third. The author's approach of grouping them as one might have been unexpected. \n\nAlso, the amount in question is $15. The author is holding the friend accountable for this, but the friend doesn't want to pay the extra. The author is making a big deal out of it, which could strain the friendship. Even though the author might feel justified in splitting it their way, the friend's perspective is valid too. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting costs based on the number of individuals is more common. The author's approach might be seen as unfair because the friend is being asked to pay half, which is more than their share if split three ways. So the author might be in the wrong here by not considering the standard practice. \n\nAdditionally, the author's insistence on the $15 after the friend refuses to pay that amount shows that the author is prioritizing the money over the friendship, which is a negative aspect. The friend hasn't been in touch since the request, which indicates that the author's approach might have been too rigid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't account for the usual practice of splitting by the number of people, leading to a misunderstanding and conflict over a relatively small amount.\n"
