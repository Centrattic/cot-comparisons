We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. The story says they joked about an open relationship, and the wife mentioned a specific coworker. The husband got really upset and now wants to end the relationship, even though she's apologized and changed her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife was honest, which is a positive point. She admitted her feelings and even took steps to avoid the coworker. However, the husband's reaction is to want a divorce because of a crush, which is common in many people. Crushes can be a normal part of life, but when it comes to a spouse, it can cause trust issues.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the wife's actions, even if just a crush, made the husband feel insecure or betrayed, that's a valid feeling. But wanting a divorce solely because of a crush might be a heavy response. The key here is whether the wife was being unfaithful or if it's just a harmless crush. Since she's not actually cheating and has taken steps to avoid the coworker, maybe the husband is overreacting. However, the fact that she joked about having someone in mind and the word \"wreck her\" might have crossed a line, depending on their agreed-upon boundaries. If they discussed and agreed that open relationships aren't an option, then her suggesting it could be a breach of trust. But if they were just joking, and she's not acting on it, the husband's reaction might be disproportionate.\n\nI should also consider cultural and personal expectations. Some people might view a spouse having a crush as something that can't be tolerated, while others might see it as a minor issue if there's no action involved. The wife's comparison to guys watching porn could imply that she sees it as a common fantasy, but that might not make it any less hurtful to the husband. \n\nThe TLDR is the husband wants to leave because the wife has a crush. The wife is honest and has apologized, but the husband's feelings are hurt. The question is if the husband is in the wrong for wanting the divorce. Since the wife isn't cheating and has tried to address the issue, maybe the husband is in the wrong for not handling it better. But then again, the emotional impact is real for him. It's a tough one. I think it's not a clear-cut answer, but in most cases, wanting a divorce over a crush without any actual infidelity might be seen as the husband not handling the situation well. So the answer would be B for No, the author is not in the wrong. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B, then it means the author is not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the answer is A, then the author is in the wrong. The story says the wife was honest and took steps to fix it, but the husband still wants to leave. Depending on the context, if the husband is prioritizing his feelings over the wife's efforts to mend the relationship, maybe he's not wrong. But maybe he is overreacting. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong because the wife's actions (even if just a crush) can be a dealbreaker for some people. The husband has every right to feel hurt and decide that he can't be in a relationship where his partner fantasizes about others, even if the wife is trying to change. So the final answer is B.\n"
