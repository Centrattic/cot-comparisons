We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. The wife admitted to having a crush, joked about an open relationship, and the husband feels hurt and wants to end the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife was honest about her feelings, even if it was a joke. She apologized and tried to correct the situation by cutting ties with the coworker. The husband is hurt because he feels his wife lusted after someone else, even if it's just physical attraction. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife was upfront, which is commendable. However, the husband's reaction is about feeling hurt and not being able to reconcile that. Divorce is a big step, but it's his right if he can't move past the hurt. The question is whether it's his fault for ending the marriage. \n\nThe husband might be in the right if the trust is irreparably broken. On the other hand, if the wife's actions didn't cross boundaries beyond expressing attraction, maybe the husband's reaction is disproportionate. But since the wife took steps to address it, and the husband still feels it's a deal-breaker, it's a personal choice. So he's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end it.\n"
