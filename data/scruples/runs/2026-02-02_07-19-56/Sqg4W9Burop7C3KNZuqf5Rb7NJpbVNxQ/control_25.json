We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she's been fantasizing about. The author was upset, felt hurt, and now wants a divorce. She apologized, tried to cut off contact with the coworker, but he's still hurt.\n\nSo, the key points here: The wife was honest, admitted her feelings, and took steps to avoid the coworker. The husband is hurt and feels the relationship has fizzled out. He's considering divorce because of her crush, even though she's made efforts to address it.\n\nI need to consider societal norms, relationship dynamics, and what's reasonable. In many relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife was upfront, which is positive. However, the husband's reaction is based on emotional hurt. It's valid for someone to feel betrayed even if the other person isn't cheating. But does that justify divorce?\n\nOn one hand, the wife's honesty is commendable, and she's making efforts to respect his feelings. On the other hand, the husband feels the relationship can't continue. The question is whether his desire for divorce is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nIn some perspectives, if a partner expresses a crush but isn't acting on it and is willing to avoid the person, it's a matter of personal boundaries. The husband might need to evaluate if he can move past this. However, if the emotional pain is too much, seeking divorce isn't inherently wrong. It's a personal choice, but maybe there's a middle ground.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the husband feels he can't be around her anymore. The wife is trying to make amends, but it's not enough. The answer depends on whether the husband's reaction is proportionate. Some might say he's overreacting, while others might validate his feelings.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at who's behaving unreasonably. If the wife didn't cross a line (no cheating, open communication, trying to fix the issue) and the husband is still choosing to leave despite her efforts, maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's being overly controlling or not giving her a chance, that's different.\n\nSo, the author's decision to seek a divorce is personal, but if he's hurt and can't reconcile, it's not necessarily wrong. The wife's actions might not be the issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no red flags I missed. The wife isn't cheating, just has a crush, so the husband's reaction is about his own feelings. It's a tough call, but the answer leans towards B.\n"
