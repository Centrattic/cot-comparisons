We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife admitted to having a crush on her coworker and joked about an open relationship. The author is hurt and wants a divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The wife was honest and even apologized, which shows she didn't mean to hurt him. The author is feeling betrayed and can't move past it, even though the wife has tried to cut the coworker out of her social circle. But is wanting a divorce because of a crush fair?\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife was open about her feelings, which is a positive. However, the author's reaction is extreme\u2014ending the marriage over a crush might be disproportionate. The wife hasn't acted on her crush; it's just a fantasy. So, maybe the author is overreacting. But on the other hand, if the author can't trust or feel secure in the relationship, it's valid for him to seek a divorce. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife didn't do anything wrong, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author's reaction is too harsh without the wife actually cheating or doing something to warrant it, then maybe he is in the wrong. Since the wife was honest and took steps to address the issue, the author's decision to end the marriage might be seen as the AITA. But it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. I think that wanting a divorce because of a crush, even if it's hurtful, isn't necessarily the wife's fault. The author has the right to his feelings, but maybe the wife did nothing wrong. So the author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt, but is he in the wrong for wanting a divorce? If the wife was honest and tried to fix things, maybe the author is being unreasonable. But it's his choice. Maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
