We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants a divorce because their wife admitted to crushing on a coworker is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which might indicate she's open to non-monogamous arrangements. However, the husband found it hurtful. The key points here are the wife's honesty and the husband's feelings. She admitted her feelings, which is a positive aspect, but he feels betrayed. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The wife being open about her crush might be seen as honest, but the husband's reaction shows that he needs more than just honesty\u2014he needs emotional security. If the wife doesn't respect his boundaries regarding jealousy, that's a problem. However, the wife isn't cheating; she's just having a crush. \n\nBut the husband is feeling hurt and considering divorce. Is that fair? Well, feelings matter. If the husband can't get over the fact that his wife has a crush, even after she's made efforts to avoid the coworker, then maybe it's valid for him to want space. On the other hand, the wife's honesty is commendable, and maybe the husband should work through his feelings instead of ending the marriage. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife admitted her feelings, apologized, and tried to adjust by cutting off contact with the coworker. The husband's issue is more about his own discomfort with her having a crush, even if she's not acting on it. In a healthy relationship, both partners' needs should be met. If the husband can't handle this situation and the wife has made efforts to address his concerns, maybe the husband is justified in seeking a divorce. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that wanting a divorce over a non-acting-on-it crush is too much, especially if the wife is committed otherwise. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, if the wife did nothing wrong (no cheating, honest, tried to fix it), then the author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt. So the answer would be B (no).\n"
