We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, the wife approached the author about an open relationship. They were joking, but she mentioned a specific coworker and even made a comment like wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The author was upset, and while the wife apologized and tried to address it by cutting ties with the coworker, the author still feels hurt and wants to end the relationship.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about consent and boundaries. The wife was honest, even if it was in a joking context. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014jealousy and the mention of a specific person can definitely hurt. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners have the right to express their feelings, but also to set boundaries. The author might feel violated or untrusting, which are valid emotions. However, if the wife was trying to be open and was willing to change her behavior after the discussion, that shows effort. The author's immediate reaction to want a divorce might be a bit intense. \n\nBut then again, the author is allowed to feel that way. If the trust is broken, that's a personal choice. The scenario is a bit complex. The wife's actions might have crossed a line in the author's mind even if she didn't mean it seriously. The author isn't wrong for feeling hurt, but maybe rushing into divorce without more discussion or counseling? However, the story says that the author tried talking, and the wife made changes. The author might still feel the emotional damage is irreparable. \n\nI need to decide if the author's desire for divorce is justified. If the wife admitted to having a crush and then took steps to avoid it, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the author can't move past it, that's their prerogative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife was honest, the author's reaction might be his own issue. But maybe not, because it's valid to not want a partner with such feelings. \n\nI think the answer here is B. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a matter of perspective and how they handle their emotions. The wife was honest, but the author's trust is compromised. However, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But I need to make sure. Maybe the author is not wrong for wanting to leave, given the hurt and the change in their relationship. So the answer is B.\n"
