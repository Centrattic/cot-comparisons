We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the prompt is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she's been lusting after. She joked about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband was upset, and even though the wife apologized and cut ties with the coworker, he still wants to end the relationship because he's hurt.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust and emotional comfort in a marriage. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is important. She took steps to address his concerns by cutting the coworker out of her life. But the husband is still hurt and feels the relationship has fizzled out. \n\nIs he wrong? Well, every relationship is different. If the wife was honest and made changes, maybe the husband's reaction is about his own feelings rather than her actions. But on the other hand, having a crush on someone else can be a dealbreaker for some people. The wife might not have done anything wrong, but the husband's feelings are valid. \n\nIn some cases, people might consider the wife's honesty a positive, but the husband's insecurity or the fact that she had a crush could still cause issues. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about trust and boundaries. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he has the right to feel hurt and to want to end the marriage if he can't get over it. The wife did her part by being honest and cutting ties, but if the husband still can't move past it, it's his call. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
