We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wants a divorce is in the wrong because their wife admitted to having a crush on a coworker. So, first, I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe wife brought up an open relationship as a joke but mentioned a specific coworker. She even made a comment about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband was upset, and even though the wife apologized, he's hurt. She later explained that it's just about his physical appearance and compared it to guys watching porn. She's willing to cut off contact with him, but the husband feels the relationship has fizzled out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife was honest, the husband is hurt by her crush, and she's trying to make amends. The husband is considering divorce because he can't be around her anymore. \n\nNow, in relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. If the husband can't move past this, maybe it's valid for him to seek a divorce, especially if he's not comfortable. But is he in the wrong? Well, the wife was honest, which is a positive. However, having a crush on someone else, even if it's just physical, can be a deal-breaker for some people. The husband's reaction is about feeling hurt and the relationship changing for him. Divorce is a big step, but if he can't get over this, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nOn the flip side, the wife tried to address it by cutting off contact. But if the husband is still not okay with it, he's not wrong for wanting out. It's about mutual respect and whether both parties can be comfortable. Since they're considering divorce, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I missed. The wife's actions were honest, but the husband's reaction is about his feelings. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong for seeking divorce. Answer B.\n"
