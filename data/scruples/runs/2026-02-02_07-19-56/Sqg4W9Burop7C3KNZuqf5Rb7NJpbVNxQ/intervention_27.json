We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife brought up an open relationship in a joking manner but mentioned a specific coworker she's attracted to. The husband was upset, they talked, she apologized, and now he's considering divorce. The wife says the coworker is just a physical type and that she's committed to the marriage. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is usually a good thing. But the husband is hurt because of her infatuation. The question is whether his reaction is justified. \n\nOn one hand, having a crush on someone else can be damaging if it leads to jealousy or breaches of trust. However, the wife seems to be making an effort to avoid the situation by cutting off contact with the coworker. She also emphasizes that it's just physical attraction, not emotional. \n\nBut the husband feels that something has changed, and he can't be around her anymore. It's his right to feel that way if he's not comfortable. However, wanting a divorce over a crush might be extreme unless there's more to it. But the story says the wife was upfront and tried to make amends. \n\nI think this depends on the couple's values. If the husband values monogamy and can't get over the idea of his wife being attracted to someone else, then it's his prerogative. But if the wife is committed to the relationship and made changes, maybe the husband is overreacting. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong. I'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's entitled to his feelings. But I need to consider if the wife's actions were a dealbreaker. Since she admitted it and tried to fix things, maybe the husband is overstepping by wanting a divorce. But I'm not sure. Maybe B is the right answer here.\n"
