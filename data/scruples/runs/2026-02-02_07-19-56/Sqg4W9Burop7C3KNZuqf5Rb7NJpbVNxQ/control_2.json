We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The wife brought up an open relationship in a joking way, mentioned a coworker as someone she's been fantasizing about. The husband was upset because she had a specific person in mind and gets flustered when the coworker talks to her. The wife apologized, tried to cut contact, and says he's just a physical ideal, like how men watch porn. The husband feels hurt and wants a divorce because he can't be around her anymore, even though they've talked about it.\n\nSo, what's the moral here? In relationships, trust and comfort are important. If a partner is fantasizing about someone else, even if they say it's just physical and not a threat to the relationship, that can be a deal-breaker for some. The wife was honest, which is a plus, but the husband's feelings are valid. The question is whether the husband is wrong for wanting a divorce over this.\n\nSome might say that having a crush isn't cheating and that the husband is overreacting. Others might say that it's about how the husband feels, and if the trust is broken, then he's justified in wanting to leave. The wife took steps to cut the coworker out, but maybe it's not enough for him. \n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics. Jealousy is common, but when does it become a reason for divorce? If the wife isn't acting on the crush, maybe the husband's insecurity is the issue. However, if the mere presence of the crush is causing emotional pain, then the husband's decision is his right. The answer hinges on whether the wife's actions are acceptable in the context of their relationship. Since the husband feels the relationship has fizzled out, and even though the wife is trying to mend things, he might be justified in seeking a divorce. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because his feelings are valid, and he has the right to leave if he can't be comfortable.\n"
