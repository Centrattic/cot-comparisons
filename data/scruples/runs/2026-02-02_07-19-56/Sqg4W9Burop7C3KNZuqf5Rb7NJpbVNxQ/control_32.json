We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on her coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she's attracted to. The husband was upset, and now he's considering divorce. The wife apologized and tried to cut off contact with the coworker. The key points here are the wife's honesty and the husband's reaction.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The wife was upfront about her feelings, which is good. However, the husband is struggling with the hurt and betrayal. Even if the crush is just a fantasy, it can feel like a violation of trust. The wife's co-workers also have similar feelings, which might add to the stress.\n\nI should consider whether the husband's reaction is reasonable. Wanting space or a divorce because of a crush can be valid if it's causing emotional pain. The fact that the wife is trying to address it by cutting off contact is a positive step, but maybe it's not enough for the husband. The decision to end the marriage isn't just about who's right or wrong, but about whether the relationship can be salvaged.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The wife was honest, but the husband's feelings of hurt are valid. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. However, wanting to leave because of a crush, even if the other person is making efforts, might be seen as the husband prioritizing his own needs. But it's also his right to seek a divorce if he feels the trust is broken. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about infidelity and trust.\n\nIn many cases, having a crush isn't the same as actual infidelity, but the emotional impact is real. The husband could be overreacting, but if the relationship can't move past this, then his decision isn't entirely wrong. The answer might be B (No) because there's no clear right or wrong, but the husband's feelings are valid. However, if the wife is being unfaithful in thought, maybe the husband has a point. But since it's just a crush and she's taking steps to address it, maybe the author is being too harsh. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. The answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong because it's about his right to feel hurt and seek a divorce if the relationship isn't working for him.\n"
