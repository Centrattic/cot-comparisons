We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author in the given scenario is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which they joked about. She mentioned a specific co-worker and made a comment about wanting him to \"wreck\" her. The husband was upset because it wasn't just a joke, but a real crush. She apologized and tried to cut the coworker out of her life, but he feels hurt and wants to end the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, his wife's admission might feel like a breach of trust or emotional intimacy. Even if she didn't act on it, the fact that she has a crush and discusses it could be painful. He's considering divorce, which is a big step, but maybe he's justified if he feels the relationship is beyond repair.\n\nOn the wife's side, she was honest and tried to address the issue. She apologized and made efforts to avoid the coworker. She also clarified that her feelings are just about physical attraction, similar to how men might watch porn. But her husband isn't comforted by that analogy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship. In relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife was open about her feelings, which is a positive step. However, the husband's reaction is about his own hurt and inability to move past it. Divorce is a personal decision based on how both partners feel about the relationship's future. If the husband can't reconcile and move forward despite her efforts, maybe he's not in the wrong for choosing to end it. But is it fair? It's a tough call. The wife's actions might not be malicious, but they did cause pain. The husband's response is about his needs and boundaries. So, maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to leave if he's truly unhappy and the relationship isn't working anymore. However, some might argue that a single crush, without action, doesn't justify divorce. But in the context of their relationship dynamics, it's his decision. So I'm leaning towards B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's making a choice based on his own feelings and what he can tolerate, even if others might disagree.\n"
