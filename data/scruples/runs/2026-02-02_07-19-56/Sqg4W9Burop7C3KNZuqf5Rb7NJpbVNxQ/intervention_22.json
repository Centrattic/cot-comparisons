We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the a**hole for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on her coworker. First, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nSo, the wife asked if he'd consider an open relationship, which started as a joke. She mentioned a coworker she's into, which the husband took as a betrayal. The wife apologized, and he's hurt. He says the relationship has fizzled out and wants to separate. She's willing to cut the coworker out of her life.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a marriage, trust and feelings are crucial. If the wife admits to having a crush on someone else, even if it's just a fantasy, it can be really hurtful. The husband's reaction is understandable from an emotional standpoint. He might feel that her actions and words have broken trust, even if she's not acting on the crush. \n\nBut wait, the wife apologized and is trying to make amends by cutting the coworker out. She claims it's just physical attraction and not emotional. The husband might be overreacting if he's taking her words out of context. Maybe she was joking and didn't mean to hurt him. But people process things differently. If he can't get over it, maybe it's valid for him to seek a divorce. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's honest and willing to change, maybe the husband should give the marriage another try. But if the trust is broken, that's hard to rebuild. The key here is whether the wife's actions crossed a line. If she's just having a fantasy and not engaging in any physical or emotional affair, maybe the husband is being too harsh. However, the fact that she brought it up and the husband felt hurt is valid. \n\nDifferent people have different boundaries. If the husband can't handle his wife having a crush, even if it's just a fantasy, then he's not in the wrong for wanting to leave. But if the wife is making efforts to fix the relationship, maybe he's being too quick to end it. But again, the hurt is real. \n\nI think the answer depends on the context of their relationship and their communication. If this is the first time such a thing has happened and the wife is genuinely trying to fix it, then maybe the husband is being too quick. But if this is a deal-breaker for him, then he's not in the wrong. The question is whether wanting a divorce over a crush (without action) is justified. \n\nIn some cases, people can get over a partner having a crush if it's not acted upon. But if the husband can't, then he's not the a**hole. The wife might be at fault for not considering his feelings when bringing up the crush, but the husband's reaction is also about his own boundaries. \n\nOverall, I think the husband isn't in the wrong if he's hurt and can't move past it. The answer is B.\n"
