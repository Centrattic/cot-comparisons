We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, mentioned a specific coworker she's attracted to, and uses him as a fantasy. The husband got upset, and now he's considering ending the marriage. The wife has apologized, tried to cut contact with the coworker, and claims her feelings are just physical. The husband feels hurt and can't handle the dynamic anymore.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is understanding both perspectives. On one hand, the wife was honest and made an effort to address the issue by cutting off contact. On the other hand, the husband is feeling betrayed and unable to move past her admitted feelings. \n\nIn relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. If the husband can't get over the fact that his wife has had these feelings, even if she's addressed the behavior, it's hard to blame him for seeking a divorce. Jealousy and insecurity are natural, and if the feelings persist despite her actions to fix the situation, it might be a sign that the relationship isn't working for him. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider if the husband gave enough time for the situation to resolve. The wife stopped interacting with the coworker, so maybe communication and counseling could have helped. But the husband's feelings of being hurt are valid. The decision to end a marriage isn't taken lightly, and if the emotional connection is gone, it's not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because his feelings are valid, and the wife's actions might not have fully addressed his emotional needs. But there's a balance here. It's not about right or wrong, but about whether both partners can work through the issues. Since he's decided he can't be around her anymore, maybe it's a matter of personal boundaries and self-respect. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
