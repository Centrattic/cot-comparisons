We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife asked about an open relationship jokingly and mentioned a coworker. The author felt hurt because it wasn't just a joke. She apologized multiple times, and the author now feels the relationship has fizzled out. She's agreed to cut contact with the coworker. The author is considering divorce because of this.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, trust and communication are key. The wife was honest about her feelings, even if it came out in a joking manner. The author took it seriously and is now considering divorce. But does the wife's crush justify divorce? Crushes aren't uncommon, and people often have attractions to others. The author's reaction might be about his own insecurities or the fact that the crush exists at all.\n\nHowever, the wife has made efforts to address the issue by cutting off contact. The author might be overreacting. On the other hand, if the author can't trust his wife or feels that the emotional connection is gone, maybe he's justified in seeking a divorce. But is that making him the wrong one here? Or is he just prioritizing his own needs? \n\nI think the key point is whether the wife's actions were malicious. She didn't act on the crush, just acknowledged it. The author might be in the wrong for not being able to handle the situation maturely. Divorce is a big step, and if the relationship has indeed fizzled out, maybe both parties are at fault. But the question is specifically about the author's fault. Since he's choosing to end the marriage based on a crush that hasn't led to actual infidelity, maybe he's overreacting. So, I lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
