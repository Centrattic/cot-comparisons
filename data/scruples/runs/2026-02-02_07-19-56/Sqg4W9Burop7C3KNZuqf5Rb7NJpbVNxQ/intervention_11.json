We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. I need to figure out if the author is justified in his feelings and actions here.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The wife asked if he's open to an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she's into. They were joking at first, but she later admitted she has a crush on this guy. The husband got upset, they had arguments, and now he's considering divorce. The wife apologized, tried to cut ties with the coworker, and says he's just a physical ideal. The husband feels hurt and wants to end the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries in a relationship, trust, and the emotional impact of a partner's crush. The wife was honest, which is good, but the husband feels betrayed. Even though the wife didn't act on the crush, the fact that she expressed interest in someone else caused him pain. \n\nI need to consider if the husband overreacted. In relationships, trust is crucial. If a partner shows interest in someone else, even if it's just a crush, it can be hurtful. The husband might feel that the wife's honesty, while appreciated, revealed something that damaged the trust. On the other hand, the wife tried to address it by cutting off contact. \n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting a divorce. Divorce is a big step. Is it reasonable to end a marriage because of a crush that didn't lead to actual infidelity? The wife hasn't crossed the line into cheating; she just had a crush. The husband might be feeling insecure or unloved, but does that justify ending the marriage? \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that wanting to end a relationship over a crush is too harsh. However, if the husband can't move past it, it's his right to seek a divorce. The problem is whether the wife's actions were wrong. She was honest, but maybe she should have been more mindful of his feelings. However, the husband also needs to communicate his boundaries better in the future. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the husband's reaction is proportional. If the wife's crush is a deal-breaker for him, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's ending it over something that didn't result in cheating, maybe he's overreacting. The community's perspective on \"Am I the Asshole\" often considers intent and harm. The wife didn't cheat, but the husband felt hurt. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong if he's ending the marriage without considering reconciliation or if the wife made genuine efforts to address the issue. If the wife is willing to change her behavior and the husband is still not okay with it, that's his personal choice, but maybe he's acting out of insecurity rather than the wife's fault. However, if the husband can't trust her anymore, it's his prerogative. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key is whether the wife's actions were wrong. She expressed a crush but didn't act on it. The husband's reaction is about his feelings. If he can't get over it, he's not the asshole for ending the marriage but maybe he's not in the wrong either. However, if the wife made apologies and tried to fix things, the husband's decision might be harsh. \n\nAlternatively, if the husband sets boundaries and the wife crossed them (even if it's a crush), then he's justified. But in this case, the wife tried to stay away from the coworker. So maybe the husband is overreacting. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the wife's actions, while hurtful, didn't involve cheating. But the husband's feelings are valid. However, ending the marriage over a crush might be extreme. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is ending the marriage because of a crush that wasn't acted upon, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. But if the community's perspective is that it's too harsh, maybe he is. I'm a bit torn here. \n\nIn typical AITA logic, if the wife didn't cheat and tried to make amends, the husband might be the one at fault for not accepting that. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But if the husband feels the trust is broken, then maybe not. It's a close call. The key is that the wife's actions didn't violate the relationship terms beyond having a crush. So maybe the author is in the wrong for overreacting. Therefore, answer A.\n"
