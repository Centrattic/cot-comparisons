We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. I need to figure out if AITA (Am I the Asshole) this is.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The wife asked the husband if they could try an open relationship, which sounds like a joke but she actually had a coworker in mind. She mentioned this guy and that she wants the coworker to \"wreck her,\" which is pretty direct. The husband is hurt and wants a divorce now, even though the wife apologized multiple times. She says the coworker is just a physical specimen, like guys looking at porn, and he's her ideal type. She's willing to avoid him, but the husband still feels the relationship is over.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to end the marriage because of this. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the wife admitted to having a crush and even mentioned the open relationship idea. That's not something trivial; it can shake trust and security in a relationship. The husband feeling hurt is understandable. Jealousy and insecurity are natural, and if this crush is a recurring thing, maybe even ongoing, it could indicate deeper issues. The fact that she was flustered when the coworker approached her suggests there's some real attraction, not just fantasy. The husband might feel that his wife isn't fully committed or that her actions (like getting flustered) are crossing boundaries, even if she's not acting on it.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife apologized and is trying to cut contact with the coworker. She might be expressing a fantasy, which doesn't necessarily mean she wants to act on it. People often have fantasies, and comparing it to guys watching porn makes sense. The husband might be overreacting if it's just a fantasy and not an action. Also, wanting an open relationship could be a sign of a desire for more freedom, which isn't inherently wrong, but it's a big deal in a monogamous relationship. The husband's decision to end the marriage could be too hasty, especially if the wife is making efforts to address his concerns.\n\nBut the key here is the emotional impact. The husband is hurt because his wife isn't just having a fantasy but is actively thinking about this coworker in a sexual way. Even if she's not acting on it, the fact that she's expressing these feelings could lead to trust issues. In a committed relationship, transparency and trust are crucial. If the wife is being honest, that's a good sign, but the husband's feelings are valid. People have different thresholds for what they can tolerate. If he can't get past this, maybe the relationship isn't compatible anymore.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's friends and coworkers also lust after this guy. So maybe he's just seen as a typical attractive person, which makes her comparison to porn more plausible. However, the husband's discomfort is real. He might feel that his wife is more attracted to this guy's physical appearance than to him. Even if she says he's her ideal type, the husband might feel he's not meeting her physical standards, which is a core part of their relationship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: the wife's actions led to the hurt, but the husband's reaction is about his own feelings and the relationship's future. Divorce is a big step, so maybe there's room for counseling or more communication. However, if the husband feels that the trust is broken and he can't move past it, it's not necessarily his fault. The problem is whether the wife's actions are justified. She was honest, but the fantasy and the initial open relationship suggestion might have crossed a line for him.\n\nIn some relationships, fantasies are okay as long as they don't interfere with the relationship. But if the husband finds the fact that she's lusting after someone else to be a deal-breaker, even if she's not acting on it, then he's within his rights to want out. The issue is whether his reaction is the asshole move. If he's being reasonable and she's being honest, maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's overreacting to something that's within the bounds of a normal relationship, then he might be.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But considering that the wife was open about her feelings and made changes (cutting contact with the coworker), the husband's decision to end the marriage might be a valid choice based on his emotional needs. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
