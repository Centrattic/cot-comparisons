We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which started as a joke but then she mentioned a specific coworker. The author got upset because it wasn't just hypothetical; there's a real person involved. The wife has shown physical reactions when the coworker interacts with her, and her friends also find him attractive. The wife apologized multiple times and tried to explain it's just about physical attraction, comparing it to men watching porn. The author feels hurt and decides the relationship has fizzled out, but the wife is willing to cut ties with the coworker. The author is conflicted but feels something changed, leading to wanting to end things.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. In relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if they say they're committed, it can create trust issues. The wife's actions (getting flustered, friends' behavior) suggest she's not just fantasizing but maybe engaging in some level of flirtation. The author is right to feel hurt because their emotional connection might be affected. However, the wife did apologize and tried to make changes. The author's reaction might be a bit strong\u2014considering divorce over fantasies alone could be seen as extreme. But it's also valid if the marriage's foundation is eroding. The key is whether the wife's actions cross a line into betrayal. If she's not acting on it, maybe the author is overreacting. But if it's causing lasting emotional harm, then the author's decision is understandable. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're hurt and the wife hasn't fully addressed the issue (just avoiding interaction but still having feelings), the author might not be in the wrong. So I'd lean towards B.\n"
