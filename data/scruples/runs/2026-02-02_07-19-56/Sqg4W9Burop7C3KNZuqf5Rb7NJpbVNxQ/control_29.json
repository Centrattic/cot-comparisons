We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on her coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship and mentioned a specific coworker she has a crush on. The husband was upset, leading to tension. The wife apologized and tried to cut off contact, but the husband feels hurt and wants to end the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet's break it down. In a marriage, trust and comfort are crucial. The wife's confession about her crush might be a breach of trust from the husband's perspective. Even if the coworker is just a physical specimen, the husband's feelings matter. However, the wife was honest and tried to resolve it by cutting contact. \n\nBut the husband is choosing to end the relationship. Is that justified? Well, if the wife's actions made him feel insecure and the relationship no longer works for him, he's not necessarily wrong for seeking a divorce. The problem is that the wife's actions, while maybe not malicious, still caused emotional pain. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife apologized and tried to fix things. But the husband's feelings of hurt are valid. The question is whether his desire for divorce is justified. \n\nIn relationships, when one partner is hurt and can't move past it, wanting to end the relationship isn't wrong. The wife's actions might not be malicious, but if they caused irreparable damage, the husband's decision isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. However, I need to make sure there's no nuance I missed. The wife's honesty is a plus, but the husband's emotional response is valid. The key is that the husband is reacting to his feelings of betrayal and hurt, which are legitimate even if the situation wasn't intentional. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
