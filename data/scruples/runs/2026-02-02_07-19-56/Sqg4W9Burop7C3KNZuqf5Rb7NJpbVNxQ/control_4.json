We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which was a joke, but she mentioned a specific coworker. The author got really upset because it wasn't just a hypothetical. The wife has apologized multiple times, and the author feels hurt. She says the coworker is just a physical specimen and not a real romantic interest, comparing it to guys watching porn. The author tried to work through it but feels something changed, leading them to consider divorce.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here: the wife was honest but maybe crossed a line by bringing up a specific person. The author's reaction is about trust and emotional pain. In relationships, trust is crucial. Even if the wife says it's just a fantasy, the fact that she's lusting after someone else can be deeply hurtful. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. Divorce is a personal decision, but the hurt and loss of trust are valid reasons. The wife's actions, while not cheating, might be causing irreparable damage. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
