We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife admitted to having a crush on her coworker and mentioned it in a joking way when discussing open relationships. The husband got really upset, which makes sense because he's hurt. The wife apologized multiple times and tried to make amends by cutting off contact with the coworker outside of work. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out and wants to end things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's honesty might be appreciated in some respects, but the fact that she has a crush on someone else could be a deal-breaker for the husband. Jealousy and trust are important in a marriage. The husband's reaction is understandable because he feels betrayed, even if it's just a crush and not an actual affair. On the other hand, the wife was upfront and tried to address the issue by removing the coworker from her life. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong for wanting a divorce. If the wife never acted on the crush and took steps to avoid it, maybe the husband is overreacting. But if the mere existence of the crush caused emotional harm and eroded trust, then maybe he's justified in wanting to end the marriage. Also, communication is key here. They had discussions where she tried to explain it's just physical, like how men watch porn. That analogy might not sit well with him. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether having a crush, even if not acted upon, is a valid reason to end a marriage. Some people might say that as long as there's no infidelity, the husband is overreacting. Others might argue that trust and comfort in the relationship are paramount, and if the wife can't maintain emotional fidelity, it's breaking the relationship. \n\nGiven that the wife apologized and took steps to cut ties, maybe the husband is the one being unreasonable. But if the emotional damage is too much, maybe he's justified. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to balance these perspectives. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might see the husband as too possessive, while others support his decision. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the wife's actions (admitting the crush and not respecting boundaries) could have legitimately hurt him. But if the husband is choosing to leave over something that didn't involve actual betrayal, maybe A (in the wrong). Hmm. It's a tough call. The key is whether the husband's reaction is proportionate. Since there's no cheating, but just a crush, maybe the answer is A. But if the husband feels like the trust is broken, then B. I'm a bit conflicted but leaning towards B because the wife's actions were honest, and the husband is prioritizing his feelings over the relationship.\n"
