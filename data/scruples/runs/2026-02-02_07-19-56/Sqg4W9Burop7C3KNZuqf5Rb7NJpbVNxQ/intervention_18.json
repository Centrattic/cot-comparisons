We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The wife asked about an open relationship in a joking way, mentioned a co-worker she finds attractive, and even made a joke about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband got upset, leading to arguments. She apologized multiple times, saying he's the real partner and that the coworker is just a physical ideal, like how guys watch porn. The husband now wants to distance himself and the wife is cutting off contact with the coworker. The husband is considering divorce.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and personal boundaries. The wife shared her feelings, albeit in a joking manner, but the husband found it hurtful. The wife tried to address it by cutting the coworker out, but the damage was done. \n\nIn a relationship, communication is crucial. The wife was honest, which is good, but the husband's reaction is about feeling betrayed. However, having a crush isn't the same as cheating. The wife hasn't acted on it. The husband's response is emotional, but does that justify ending the marriage? Maybe the issue is more about how he handles jealousy rather than the act itself. \n\nBut relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If the husband can't get over this, maybe there are deeper issues. However, the wife did make an effort to address his concerns. The husband might be the one in the wrong if he's ending the marriage over something that hasn't crossed into actual betrayal. On the other hand, trust is a big part of a relationship, and if the wife's actions eroded that trust, then the husband's reaction could be seen as justified. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and personal values. In many views, wanting a divorce over a crush without actual infidelity might be seen as overreacting. But if the husband feels deeply hurt and the relationship can't recover, then it's his right to seek a divorce. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to end it. If the wife was honest and made amends, maybe the husband is overreacting. But if the husband's feelings are valid and the trust is broken, then it's a mutual issue. \n\nHmm, tricky. I'm leaning towards the husband being in the wrong (A) because the wife was honest and hasn't acted on the feelings, but the husband is choosing to end the marriage purely on emotional hurt from unacted-upon feelings. However, some might argue that his feelings are valid and he has the right to end it. So maybe it's a toss-up, but the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the husband is in the wrong. If B, not in the wrong. Based on typical AITA standards, they might side with the husband because his feelings are valid. But if the wife was honest, maybe the husband is overreacting. I'm a bit conflicted but think the answer is A.\n"
