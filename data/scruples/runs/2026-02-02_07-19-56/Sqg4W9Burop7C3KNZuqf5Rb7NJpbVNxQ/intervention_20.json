We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife mentioned wanting an open relationship and joked about having a coworker in mind. The husband got upset, and she apologized multiple times. He feels hurt and can't be around her anymore, while she's willing to cut off contact with the coworker. \n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and communication in a relationship. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is a positive aspect. However, having a crush on someone else can be problematic in a committed relationship, even if there's no actual infidelity. The husband's reaction is about feeling hurt and the relationship changing for him. \n\nI need to consider if wanting a divorce is a reasonable response. Crushes can be a deal-breaker for some people. If the wife is genuinely committed to the husband and takes steps to avoid contact with the coworker, maybe the husband could work through his feelings. But if the husband feels the trust is irreparably broken and the relationship has fizzled out, then his decision might be his way of protecting himself. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's honesty is commendable, but the act of having a crush and finding someone attractive can still cause emotional distress. The husband might not be at fault for prioritizing his emotional well-being. \n\nHowever, is he wrong for wanting to end the marriage over a crush? That depends on cultural and personal values. In some contexts, a crush alone isn't grounds for divorce. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate and work through issues. If he can't move past this, maybe the problem lies in how he's handling it. \n\nBut considering that the wife is open, apologetic, and willing to cut ties, perhaps the husband should be given space to decide. It's his right to feel hurt and to want to leave if he can't reconcile. \n\nSo, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong, because his feelings are valid, and if the relationship isn't working for him anymore despite her efforts, then seeking divorce is his choice.\n"
