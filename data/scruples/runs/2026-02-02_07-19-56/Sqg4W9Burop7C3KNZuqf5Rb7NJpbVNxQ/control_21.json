We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. First, I need to recall the situation details.\n\nThe wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she's attracted to. She joked about it, but the husband was upset because it wasn't just a joke. She apologized many times and tried to cut off contact with the coworker. The husband feels hurt and wants a divorce, thinking the relationship has fizzled out. The wife claims it's just physical and she's with the husband for real.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Trust is a big component in relationships. If a spouse is expressing attraction to someone else, even if it's just a fantasy or not acted upon, it can cause emotional pain. The husband's reaction is about his feelings of betrayal and insecurity. The wife, on the other hand, claims she's honest and that she's made efforts to address the issue by cutting off contact.\n\nBut the key point is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting a divorce. In many cases, people have different thresholds for what they can tolerate in a relationship. The wife's actions, while not necessarily cheating, might be causing emotional distress. The husband's right to feel hurt and decide that the relationship isn't working is valid. Divorce can be a personal choice based on one's emotional well-being. Since the wife has apologized and made changes, but the husband still feels he can't be with her, it's more about their mutual compatibility and his feelings of insecurity.\n\nThere's no legal or moral judgment here, more about emotional response. The question is whether the husband is wrong for choosing to end the marriage because he can't handle his wife's crush. Since everyone has different boundaries, and if he can't move past this, he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
