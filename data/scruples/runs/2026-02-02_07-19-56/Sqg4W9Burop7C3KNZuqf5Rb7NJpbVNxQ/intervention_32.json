We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship in a joking way but then mentioned a specific coworker. The author felt hurt and angry because it wasn't just a hypothetical. The wife apologized multiple times and tried to reconcile by saying the coworker is just a physical ideal and that the author is the real partner. She even offered to cut ties with the coworker. However, the author feels the relationship has fizzled out and wants to end it.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are trust, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is generally seen as positive. She apologized and made efforts to address the issue. On the other hand, the author is feeling hurt and betrayed, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nBut is the author justified in wanting a divorce just because of a crush? Crushes can happen in relationships, and how partners handle them varies. The wife didn't act on the crush; she was honest about it and tried to resolve the issue. The author's reaction might be about deeper insecurities or a lack of trust. However, wanting to end the relationship because of unresolved hurt is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut legal or moral issue. Relationships depend on mutual satisfaction and respect. If the author can't move past this despite the wife's efforts, it might be their personal feelings, but does that make them wrong? The wife's honesty is praiseworthy, but the author's feelings are valid. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is a reasonable response. Since the wife didn't act on the crush and the author is feeling hurt, it's a matter of communication and whether they can work through it. If the author can't reconcile, it's their choice, not necessarily wrong. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any wrongdoing.\n"
