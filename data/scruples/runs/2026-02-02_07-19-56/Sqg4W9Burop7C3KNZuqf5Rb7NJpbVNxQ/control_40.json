We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned a coworker she's into, and even joked about wanting him. The husband got really upset and is now considering divorce. The wife apologized, says she's into the husband, and is cutting off contact with the coworker. The husband feels hurt and things have changed for him.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, trust and comfort are important. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if they say they're not interested in acting on it, it can cause emotional pain. The husband has a right to feel hurt, especially if the wife was honest but it still affects their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife was upfront about her feelings. She didn't hide the crush, and she's making efforts to remove that person from her life. The husband is choosing to end the relationship because of her feelings, which might be his prerogative. But does that make him in the wrong? Relationships are about mutual respect and dealing with each other's issues. If the wife isn't cheating and is trying to address the problem, the husband's reaction might be harsh. However, if the emotional connection is gone, it's not necessarily wrong for him to want to leave. \n\nIt's a tough call. Some might say he's overreacting because the wife isn't acting on the crush, while others might say he's justified if he can't move past it. The key here is whether the husband's decision is based on valid reasons. Since the wife admitted her feelings and is making changes, but he's still unable to be around her, it might not be his fault. But if he's ending it just because of a crush that's not being acted upon, maybe he's being too harsh. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the husband is hurt and has the right to seek a divorce if he can't reconcile his feelings. The wife's honesty is a plus, but the emotional damage might be too much for him to handle, and it's his choice to end the marriage. However, others might argue that he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own emotional well-being.\n"
