We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker is in the wrong. The situation involves the wife jokingly bringing up an open relationship and mentioning her coworker. The husband is hurt and wants to end the marriage, while the wife has apologized and is trying to cut off contact with the coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife admitted her feelings, which shows honesty. The husband is upset because he feels his trust is broken. But is wanting a divorce a reasonable response? Well, trust is a big part of marriage. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if it's just a fantasy, it can cause emotional distress. The wife compares it to men watching porn, implying it's a common thing, but the husband might see it differently.\n\nThe wife has taken steps to address the issue by cutting off the coworker. Does that help? Maybe, but the husband might feel that the damage is already done. The question is whether the husband's reaction is justified. Divorce is a serious step, so the key is whether the wife's actions crossed a line that makes the husband's decision reasonable.\n\nIn relationships, what's acceptable varies a lot. If the wife's crush is just a fantasy and she's not acting on it, some might say the husband is overreacting. Others might argue that even fantasies can be hurtful if they make a partner uncomfortable. The wife's apologies and attempts to fix the situation might indicate she didn't mean to harm him, but the husband's feelings of betrayal are valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's choosing divorce because of her feelings and not actions, some might say he's being overly sensitive. But others would agree that it's his right to end the marriage if it's causing him so much pain. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values about trust and fidelity. However, since the wife didn't act on the crush, maybe the husband's reaction is too harsh. But again, it's his prerogative. The question is whether he's at fault. If he's being irrational, then yes, but if he's hurt and making a decision based on his feelings, maybe not. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because his feelings are valid, even if the situation is complex.\n"
