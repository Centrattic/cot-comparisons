We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe wife told her husband she had a crush on a coworker. They had a conversation about open relationships, which the husband took as more serious than just joking. The wife apologized, and he's hurt. The key points are: she admitted to having a crush, he's considering divorce, and she's trying to cut off contact with the coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Crushes aren't uncommon, but when one partner is aware and it causes distress, it's a problem. The wife was honest, which is good, but the husband's reaction is significant. He's choosing to leave the marriage because of her crush, even though she's made efforts to address it. \n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, wanting a divorce over a crush could be seen as extreme. However, emotional hurt is valid. If the wife's actions made him feel insecure or betrayed, that's a legitimate reason to reconsider the relationship. On the other hand, if the husband is overreacting and not addressing the issue through communication or counseling, that could be his fault. \n\nThe wife apologized and changed her behavior. The husband might be prioritizing his own hurt feelings over the possibility of resolving the issue. But in a marriage, trust and comfort are crucial. If the wife's actions, even if not physically cheating, eroded that trust, the husband's decision might be his way of protecting himself. \n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because his feelings are valid. However, some might argue that wanting a divorce over a crush is too much. But given the context of the wife's openness and his hurt, it's a tough call. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's choosing to prioritize his emotional well-being.\n"
