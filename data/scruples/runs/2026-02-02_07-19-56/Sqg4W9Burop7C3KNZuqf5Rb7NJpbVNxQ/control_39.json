We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on her coworker. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up an open relationship, which the husband found upsetting. She mentioned a coworker she's been thinking about, even joking about him \"wrecking her.\" The husband is hurt and angry because it's not just a joke\u2014she actually has feelings for this guy. Even though she apologized and says he's just a physical specimen, the husband feels the trust is broken. He can't be around her anymore and is considering divorce. The wife is willing to cut off contact with the coworker, but the husband feels something changed.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and trust. The wife was honest, which is good, but bringing up a crush in a relationship can be really hurtful. The husband's reaction is about feeling betrayed, even if it's just a crush and not an affair. In relationships, boundaries are important. If one partner is uncomfortable with their spouse having such thoughts, it's valid to feel that way. The wife might not have intended to hurt him, but her actions (even if they were honest) led to his decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife did apologize and tried to make amends by cutting ties. But the husband's feelings of being unable to be around her anymore suggests that the damage is done. Whether the husband is in the wrong depends on if his reaction is proportional. Since he's the one initiating the divorce, it's his choice, but it's not necessarily wrong if he can't move past it. People have different thresholds for what they can tolerate in a relationship. \n\nThe key here is that the wife didn't act unfaithful, but her thoughts and the way she expressed them crossed a line for the husband. The husband isn't wrong for prioritizing his own emotional well-being. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong)."
