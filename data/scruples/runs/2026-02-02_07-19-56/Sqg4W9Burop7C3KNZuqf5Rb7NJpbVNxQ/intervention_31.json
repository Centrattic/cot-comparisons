We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which started as a joke but then she mentioned a specific coworker. She described him as her fantasy and even said he should \"wreck her.\" The husband was hurt and angry, leading him to want a divorce. The wife apologized multiple times, and now the husband is considering ending the marriage even though she's trying to cut off contact with the coworker.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries in a relationship. The wife was honest, which is good, but her actions made her husband feel insecure and betrayed. Even if she views the coworker as just a fantasy figure, the fact that she's interested in someone else can be deeply hurtful. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel secure. If one partner is lusting after someone else, especially when it's a specific person and not just a hypothetical, it can break trust. The husband's reaction is about his feelings of hurt and lack of security, which are valid. But is he in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship?\n\nThe wife did apologize and is trying to make changes, but the husband's feelings have changed. The question is whether the husband's desire for divorce is justified. In many cases, people end relationships when they feel their partner's actions are incompatible with the relationship's future. If the husband can't get over this, it's understandable. However, some might argue that wanting a divorce over fantasies alone is extreme. But others might say that it's a personal right to end a marriage if it causes pain.\n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The husband isn't wrong for feeling hurt. But is he wrong for wanting a divorce? It might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. Some might say he's in the right to seek a divorce if the trust is broken. Others might think that fantasies aren't cheating and that he's overreacting. But the wife was honest, so maybe the husband's reaction is reasonable. \n\nI'm leaning towards B, the husband is not in the wrong because his feelings are valid, and the trust issue is significant. However, I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The wife tried to be open, but the damage was done in the husband's mind. So, the answer is B.\n"
