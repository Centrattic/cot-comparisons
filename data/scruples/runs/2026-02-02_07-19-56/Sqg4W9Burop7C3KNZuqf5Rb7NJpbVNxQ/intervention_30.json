We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. The wife admitted to having a crush and joked about an open relationship, but the husband is hurt and wants to end the marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is a positive aspect. She apologized and tried to address the issue by cutting off the coworker. Honesty in a relationship is important, so maybe the wife did the right thing by being open. However, the husband feels betrayed and can't be around her anymore. \n\nBut wait, does having a crush automatically mean wrongdoing? Crushes can happen, and people can have fantasies. The wife clarified it's just physical attraction and likened it to guys watching porn. That might be her way of explaining that it's not emotional. However, the husband's perspective is that the emotional attachment has changed, and he's hurt. \n\nI should think about relationship dynamics. Trust and communication are key. The wife was upfront, but the husband's reaction seems more about his own insecurities or boundaries. If the wife isn't acting on the crush and has taken steps to avoid contact, maybe the husband is overreacting. But he's entitled to his feelings. \n\nAnother angle: the husband is considering divorce over a crush that hasn't led to any actual infidelity. Is that fair? If the wife isn't cheating and is making efforts to resolve the issue, maybe the husband is not handling it constructively. However, people have different thresholds for what they can tolerate in a relationship. \n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's entitled to his feelings and the relationship isn't working for him anymore. But some might argue he's overreacting. The wife's honesty is a point in her favor, but the husband's hurt is real. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The key factors are honesty from the wife, her attempts to fix the issue, and the husband's emotional response. If the husband can't move past this, it's his choice, and he's not necessarily wrong for ending the marriage over hurt feelings.\n"
