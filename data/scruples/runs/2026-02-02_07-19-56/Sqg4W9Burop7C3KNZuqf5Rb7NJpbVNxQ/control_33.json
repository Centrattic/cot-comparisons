We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife approached the husband about an open relationship, but it wasn't just a joke\u2014she mentioned a specific coworker she finds attractive. The husband felt hurt and betrayed, even though she apologized and said she's committed to him. She claims it's similar to men watching porn, just a fantasy. He can't reconcile with her and feels the relationship is over. She's trying to cut the coworker out of her life.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and boundaries in the relationship. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is good. But the husband's reaction is about feeling uncomfortable and deciding the relationship is over. In marriage, trust and comfort are essential. If one partner can't handle the other's fantasies or attraction, even if it's not acting on them, that's a problem they need to address together. However, whether the husband is in the wrong depends on whether the wife's actions crossed a line he had agreed to. If the marriage is monogamous, then having such fantasies, while not cheating, might be a dealbreaker for him. The wife tried to be understanding and make changes (cutting ties with the coworker), but the husband still feels he can't be around her. \n\nDivorce is a personal choice, but the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. Since the wife was honest and not engaging in any physical or emotional infidelity beyond acknowledging a fantasy, and the husband is hurt but not in the wrong for needing to leave. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's allowed to feel hurt and decide the relationship isn't working for him. However, some might argue that his reaction is too harsh, but the key is that the wife didn't violate any explicit boundaries beyond her own thoughts. So the answer is B.\n"
