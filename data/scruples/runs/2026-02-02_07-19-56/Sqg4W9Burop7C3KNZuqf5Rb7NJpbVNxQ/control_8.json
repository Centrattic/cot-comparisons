We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, mentioning a specific coworker she's attracted to. She describes the coworker as her \"perfect physical specimen\" and compares the situation to men watching porn, implying that her interest is just fantasy. The husband is hurt, feels betrayed, and wants a divorce because he can't be around her anymore, even though she's apologized and agreed to avoid the coworker outside work.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries in a relationship. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is positive, but the husband felt uncomfortable with her having this crush, especially after she admitted it's not just hypothetical. The husband's reaction is about feeling hurt and not being able to move past it, leading him to consider divorce.\n\nIn relationships, trust and mutual respect are crucial. If one partner's actions or feelings make the other feel insecure or unvalued, it's a valid concern. However, wanting a divorce solely because of a crush that the partner isn't acting on might be extreme. The wife hasn't crossed into cheating or actively pursuing the relationship, which is different from having a fantasy. But the husband's emotional response is valid because he can't reconcile the hurt feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's not okay with the situation and can't work through it, seeking a divorce isn't necessarily his fault. Relationships require both parties to be on the same page. If the wife's fantasies are causing irreparable damage to the husband's trust, then his decision isn't wrong. However, the wife shouldn't have brought up the idea of an open relationship if it's causing this much distress without ensuring both are comfortable with it.\n\nBut in the end, the husband's right to end the marriage because of the emotional pain caused by his wife's infatuation is a personal choice. Unless there's a breach of trust (like actual cheating), it's hard to say he's in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong because he's entitled to leave if the relationship is hurting him.\n"
