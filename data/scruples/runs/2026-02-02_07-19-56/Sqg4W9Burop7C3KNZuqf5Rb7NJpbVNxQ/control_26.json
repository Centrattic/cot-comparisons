We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife who has a crush on her coworker and the husband wants a divorce because of it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned a specific coworker she finds attractive, and joked about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband was hurt and now wants to end the marriage. The wife apologized and said she's into the coworker only physically, comparing it to guys watching porn. The husband feels the trust is broken even though she's not acting on it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting the divorce. From a traditional perspective, some might say that having a crush isn't cheating, so the husband overreacts. But others might argue that it's about trust and emotional comfort in a relationship. The wife didn't act on the crush, but the fact that she shared it and seems to still be drawn to him could be a dealbreaker for the husband. \n\nAlso, the wife tried to make amends by cutting off contact with the coworker. But the husband feels the relationship has fizzled out. In relationships, expectations vary. If the husband expected monogamy in thoughts and actions, then the wife's crush might not meet those expectations. However, many people have crushes without it affecting the relationship. \n\nThe problem is whether the wife's actions are a valid reason for divorce. Since she's being honest and not cheating, maybe the husband is overreacting. But if the husband can't move past it, maybe he's justified in wanting out. It's a tough call. Some might say the husband is wrong because the wife didn't do anything beyond a crush, while others might side with him because his feelings are valid. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. The key is that both parties have valid emotions. The wife's honesty is commendable, but the husband's hurt is real. The question is whether wanting a divorce is the right response. I think the answer depends on cultural or personal beliefs about boundaries. If the husband felt the trust was broken, he might not be wrong. But if the wife's actions weren't harmful, then maybe the husband is overreacting. \n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's making a choice about his own comfort and trust. But others might say he's wrong for not accepting her honesty and moving past it. It's a bit of a toss-up, but given the information, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
