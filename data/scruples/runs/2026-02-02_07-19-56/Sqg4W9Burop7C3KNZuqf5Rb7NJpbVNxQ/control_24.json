We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned a specific coworker, and gets flustered when the coworker talks to her. The husband is hurt and now wants a divorce. The wife has apologized, said she's not interested in the coworker beyond physical attraction, and is committed to the husband. She's even willing to cut the coworker out of her life.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's honesty and the husband's feelings. The wife was upfront about her crush, which is important. The husband feels hurt and the trust is broken. But is the husband in the wrong for wanting to leave?\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The wife was honest, which is a positive step. However, having a crush on someone else, even if it's just physical, can be a dealbreaker for some people. The husband's reaction is about his own feelings of betrayal, even if the wife isn't acting on the crush. The question is whether the husband is justified in wanting a divorce.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship ethics: some people might find it unacceptable to have a crush on a coworker, even if they don't act on it. Others might think the wife's honesty is commendable and that the husband is overreacting. However, the husband's feelings are valid; if he can't trust her or feel secure, the relationship might not work. So, is he in the wrong? Well, he's allowed to feel hurt and decide that the marriage isn't working for him. He's not wrong for seeking a divorce if he can't reconcile his feelings. The answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his emotional well-being. But maybe some would argue he's being too harsh. However, given the context, the decision is his to make, and he's not wrong for doing that.\n"
