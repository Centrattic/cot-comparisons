We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked the husband if they could try an open relationship, which sounds like it was a joke. However, she mentioned a specific coworker who she finds attractive, comparing him to a fantasy from her teen years. The husband got angry because it wasn't just a hypothetical. The wife apologized multiple times and tried to cut off contact with the coworker, but the husband feels hurt and wants to end the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is a positive point. She also tried to address the issue by removing the coworker from her social circle. The husband, on the other hand, is struggling with the emotional impact of knowing his wife has these feelings. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife's honesty might be appreciated, but the husband's feelings of being hurt are valid. The question is whether the husband is justified in wanting a divorce. Divorce is a major decision and often a last resort. The wife's actions, while potentially uncomfortable, don't necessarily mean she's cheating or being disloyal. She's expressing attraction but hasn't acted on it. \n\nThe husband's reaction could stem from insecurity or jealousy. It's important to consider whether the husband has communicated his feelings effectively and if they've worked through this issue together. The fact that the wife is making efforts to address the problem (cutting off the coworker) shows she's trying to respect his feelings. \n\nHowever, the husband feels that the relationship has \"fizzled out,\" which suggests a deeper issue. Maybe the trust is broken, or he can't move past the situation. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to leave. \n\nIn terms of social norms, having a crush doesn't equate to cheating. The wife hasn't acted on it, so perhaps the husband is overreacting. But if the husband can't reconcile this, wanting a divorce might be his prerogative. \n\nI need to decide if the husband is wrong for wanting to leave. Since the wife hasn't done anything to directly harm the relationship beyond expressing attraction (which is a common human experience), the husband's choice might be his own, but not necessarily in the wrong. However, maybe the husband should explore counseling before deciding on divorce. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's entitled to feel hurt and want to leave if the situation is affecting his trust. But the wife's honesty is a positive aspect. The key is that the husband's decision is based on his emotional response, which is valid even if others might think he's overreacting.\n"
