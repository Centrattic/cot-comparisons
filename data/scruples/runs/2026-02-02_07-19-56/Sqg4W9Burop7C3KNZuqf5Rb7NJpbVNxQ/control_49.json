We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned she had someone in mind, and talked about a coworker she finds attractive. She admitted she gets flustered when he chats her up, even though she says he's just a physical specimen and that the author is the real one. The author feels hurt and wants to end the relationship, even though she's apologized and tried to cut the coworker out of her life.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, trust is a big part. When someone expresses a crush, especially in a marriage, it can feel like a betrayal even if there's no action. The author might be struggling with trust and insecurity. The wife's honesty is commendable, but the fact remains that she's lusting after someone else, which can be a deal-breaker for some people.\n\nBut then again, is it the author's fault for overreacting? The wife says it's similar to guys watching porn, implying it's just a fantasy. However, in a committed relationship, even fantasies about others can cause emotional distress. The author's response is valid because his feelings are legitimate. The key point here is whether the wife's actions (even if they're just thoughts) cross a line that the author can't accept.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable here. If the wife is open about her feelings but the author can't move past it, then the relationship might not work. The fact that she's made efforts to cut the coworker out shows she's trying, but the author's hurt is still there. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the marriage because his emotional needs aren't being met. The answer should be B (No).\n"
