We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (the author) is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, mentioned a specific coworker she's attracted to, and even made a joke about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband was upset, which makes sense because even if it was a joke, she expressed real feelings towards another man. She apologized multiple times and tried to cut off contact with the coworker, but the husband feels hurt and the relationship has changed for him.\n\nI should consider both sides. The wife was honest, which is important in a relationship. She might not have intended to hurt him, and she's making efforts to address his concerns by avoiding the coworker. On the other hand, the husband has the right to feel uncomfortable and hurt. If he can't get past this, it's valid for him to want to end the relationship. \n\nMarriage requires trust and comfort. If the husband can't trust his wife or feel secure knowing she's had these feelings, even if she's not acting on them, it's a legitimate reason to reconsider the relationship. The wife's actions might not be malicious, but they've caused significant emotional distress. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual comfort. The wife was upfront, which is good, but the husband's reaction is also valid. It's not about who is right or wrong in a black-and-white sense, but whether the husband's feelings are justified. Since he's the one experiencing the hurt and can't move past it, it's not necessarily his fault. \n\nAlso, the wife's comparison to men watching porn might trivialize the situation. The husband is in a committed relationship, and her having a crush, even if just in her mind, can be a deal-breaker for some. The fact that her friends and coworkers also find the coworker attractive doesn't excuse her feelings, but it does show that it's not unusual. Still, in a marriage, what's acceptable in social settings might not translate to personal relationships.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's desire to end the relationship isn't wrong. He has the right to his feelings and to seek a divorce if he can't reconcile with this. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
