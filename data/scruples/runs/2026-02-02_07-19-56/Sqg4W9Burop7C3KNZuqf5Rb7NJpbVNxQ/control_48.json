We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a specific coworker she's attracted to. The husband is hurt and wants to end the marriage. The wife has apologized and said the coworker is just a physical ideal, similar to guys watching porn. She's willing to cut ties with him.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the husband is wrong for wanting to leave over this. In relationships, trust and comfort are important. If one partner feels uncomfortable or betrayed by the other's honest confession, it's a valid feeling. The wife was honest, which is good, but the husband can't handle it. Divorce is a big step, but if the emotional connection is broken, maybe it's justified.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the wife's crush is harmless and she's addressing it by cutting off interaction. The husband's reaction might be overreacting. But others might say that in a committed relationship, even a crush can be a dealbreaker. There's no objective right or wrong here, but it's more about personal boundaries and how each person feels about the situation. The husband's feelings are valid, so he's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end the marriage.\n"
