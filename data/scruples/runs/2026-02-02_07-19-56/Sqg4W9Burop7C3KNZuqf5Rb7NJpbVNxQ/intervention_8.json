We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife admitting she has a crush on a coworker, and the husband wanting a divorce because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the story. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship in a joking manner, mentioned a specific coworker she finds attractive. The husband was hurt and wants to end the marriage. She apoloized, tried to cut off contact with the coworker, and claims it's just physical. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to analyze both sides. In relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other having a crush, especially after it's brought up, that's a valid feeling. The wife's actions might not be malicious, but the emotional hurt is real for the husband. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife was honest and made an effort to address the issue by cutting the coworker out of her life. Does that mean the husband is overreacting? Or is it reasonable for him to feel this way? Crushes can happen, but in a committed relationship, one's partner's comfort is important. The husband's decision to end the marriage is about his own feelings of being hurt and not being able to be around her. \n\nBut is wanting a divorce over a crush excessive? Maybe if the crush was just a passing thing and the wife was committed to the marriage, the husband could work through it. However, if the presence of the crush affects his daily life and makes him unable to be with his wife, that's a significant issue. He might not be in the wrong for prioritizing his own emotional well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In some views, the husband is justified because the wife's actions made him feel insecure and hurt. Others might say he's overreacting since she's not actually cheating. But the core of the issue is the harm caused by the wife's disclosure, even if it was in a joking way. \n\nI think the key here is that the husband's feelings are valid. He can't be expected to stay in a relationship if he's constantly hurt. The wife being open and trying to fix it is good, but if the husband can't move past it, ending the marriage isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
