We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife mentioned an open relationship, joked about a coworker, and even said she wanted this coworker to \"wreck her.\" The husband felt hurt and now is considering divorce. The wife has apologized, tried to cut ties with the coworker, and says the husband is the one she wants. \n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries in a relationship. The wife was honest about her feelings, which could be seen as good communication. But the husband felt betrayed even though it wasn't an actual affair. The question is about whether wanting to leave is justified.\n\nIn relationships, trust and comfort are important. If one partner is uncomfortable with certain behaviors or thoughts, even if they're not actions, they can still cause pain. The wife might not have intended to harm, but the husband's feelings are valid. On the other hand, the wife's honesty could be seen as a positive step towards resolving issues.\n\nBut the husband's reaction might be extreme. Divorce is a major decision, and the situation here is about feelings rather than actions. The wife hasn't cheated; she has a crush but isn't acting on it. The husband might need to reflect on whether his hurt is about jealousy or a deeper issue. However, if the emotional connection is gone, maybe the decision isn't wrong.\n\nConsidering societal norms, some might say the husband is overreacting, while others might support his right to end a relationship where trust is broken. But since there's no infidelity, the wife's actions are within her rights as long as she's honest. Still, the husband's feelings are valid. So, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction is reasonable. Since the question is about being in the wrong, if the wife was honest and tried to fix it, maybe the husband is being too harsh. But if the husband can't move past it, he's not wrong for prioritizing his own well-being. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's entitled to his feelings and the decision to end a relationship if he can't reconcile the hurt. But others might argue he's being too quick to leave. However, the key is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the reaction is the best one. Since there's no clear violation beyond emotional discomfort, maybe the answer is B.\n"
