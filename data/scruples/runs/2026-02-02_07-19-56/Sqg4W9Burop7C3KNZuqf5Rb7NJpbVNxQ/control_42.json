We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (TA) is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. The situation is that the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship jokingly, mentioned a coworker, and described him as a physical specimen she's lusted after. The husband feels hurt and the relationship has fizzled out, so he's considering divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is important. She apologized multiple times, showing she regrets making the husband uncomfortable. She also says she sees the coworker as a fantasy figure, similar to men watching porn, and is willing to avoid him. The key here is whether her having a crush, even if not acting on it, is a valid reason for the husband to want the marriage to end.\n\nIn relationships, trust and mutual respect are crucial. The wife's honesty could be seen as a positive, but the husband's reaction is based on his emotional hurt. However, wanting a divorce over a crush that she's not acting on might be extreme. If the crush is a fantasy and she's not engaging in any physical or emotional affair, then maybe the husband is overreacting. On the other hand, if the presence of the coworker is causing ongoing tension even after she's cut ties, his feelings are valid.\n\nThe question is about who is in the wrong. The author (TA) is not acting unfaithfully, but the wife's admission of a crush, even if it's a fantasy, could be a dealbreaker for him. The answer depends on whether having such fantasies is considered acceptable within the marriage's boundaries. If the wife is not cheating and is trying to accommodate her husband's feelings, perhaps the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the marriage over something that might be resolvable. But if the husband's emotional state is severely affected and no reconciliation is possible, then his decision is his own, though not necessarily \"in the wrong.\" The user might be looking for whether the husband's reaction is justified. The wife's actions aren't necessarily wrong if she's not acting on them, so the husband's choice to end the marriage is his right, but it's not the fault of the wife if she's being honest and trying to make amends. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
