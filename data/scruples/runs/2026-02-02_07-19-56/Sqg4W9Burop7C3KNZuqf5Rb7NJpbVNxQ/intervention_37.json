We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife mentioned wanting an open relationship, joked about a coworker, and the husband felt hurt. The wife apologized, said the coworker is just a physical specimen, and is the real one. The husband wants a divorce, thinking the relationship has fizzled out. The wife is willing to cut the coworker out of her life.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I have to decide A or B.\n\nLet me break it down. In a relationship, trust and comfort are key. The wife being honest about her crush might be seen as open, but the husband's reaction is based on feeling hurt and unable to be around her. Even if the crush is just a fantasy, it can shake the foundation of a relationship. The wife apologized and tried to address it, but the husband's decision to end the marriage is his personal choice.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, relationships are subjective. If the husband can't work through this, maybe it's valid for him to leave. However, wanting a divorce over a fantasy might be seen as overreacting. The wife was honest, and the crush isn't acted upon. The husband's response could be seen as being in the wrong if he's prioritizing his hurt feelings over the wife's efforts to resolve the issue. Alternatively, if he's not comfortable in the relationship after this, it's his right to leave.\n\nI think the key points are: the wife was honest, the crush is unacted upon, and the husband can't reconcile the feelings. If a relationship is based on mutual respect and trust, and the husband can't trust his wife anymore, maybe it's not his fault. However, some might say that wanting a divorce over a fantasy is extreme. But others might agree that if it's causing irreparable harm, then it's valid. \n\nSo, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, he is in the wrong. If B, not. Considering the wife tried to make amends and the crush isn't real, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the husband can't move past it, it's his choice. I think the answer is A because the wife was honest and tried to fix things, so the husband's desire for divorce might be his own issue rather than the wife's wrongdoing. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because he's entitled to his feelings. It's a tough call.\n"
