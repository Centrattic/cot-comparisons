We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for wanting a divorce due to their wife having a crush on a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife brought up an open relationship jokingly, mentioned a coworker she's attracted to, and now the husband is hurt and considering divorce. The wife apologized and said she wants the husband, not the coworker, but he can't get over it. She's even willing to cut off contact with the coworker. \n\nSo, the key points here are: communication between the couple, the wife's honesty, and the husband's reaction. The wife was upfront about her feelings, even if it was in a joke. The husband is hurt because he feels the crush is real, not just a fantasy. The wife clarifies it's more about physical attraction and compares it to guys watching porn. \n\nNow, considering the expectations in a relationship. Trust and emotional comfort are important. If the wife is honest and willing to address the issue, maybe the husband should communicate his needs better. However, it's also about how the wife's actions affect the husband. Even if she's not acting on the crush, the emotional hurt is real. \n\nIn some perspectives, wanting a divorce because of someone's fantasy might be too much, especially if they're not acting on it. But in another angle, the husband's feelings are valid if he can't move past the betrayal of trust or the threat to the relationship. \n\nThe answer depends on cultural or personal values. Some might say the husband overreacts, others might think it's understandable. Since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong (ATA), but is unsure, I need to weigh both sides.\n\nThe wife's honesty could be seen as a positive, but the husband's inability to handle the emotional aspect might be a deal-breaker. Divorce is a big step, so maybe there's room for counseling or more discussion. However, if the husband truly can't trust or feel secure, then wanting to leave isn't the wrong choice. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
