We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned she had someone in mind\u2014her attractive coworker. They were joking, but she later gets flustered when the coworker chats her up. Her friends and coworkers also aren't bothered by their attraction to him. The wife apologizes multiple times, says he's just a fantasy, like guys watching porn. The husband feels hurt and can't be around her anymore, leading him to consider divorce. The wife is willing to cut ties with the coworker. The husband argues that it's not just about the crush but feeling like the relationship has fizzled out.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the perspective. So, I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective: He's hurt because his wife admitted to lusting after someone else, even if it's just a fantasy. He might feel that the trust is broken, or that her feelings aren't exclusive. Even if she's not acting on it, the fact that she's thinking about another person could make him feel insecure or unworthy. Also, the mention of open relationship discussions could be a trigger for him. He's considering divorce because he can't be around her, which might indicate he's reached his breaking point.\n\nFrom the wife's side: She was honest, which is good. She apologized and tried to address the issue by cutting ties with the coworker. She views him as a fantasy, not a real threat. She's surrounded by others who also find him attractive, so maybe it's not just her. She's trying to make things right but the husband is still hurt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting divorce. In relationships, trust and communication are key. If the wife being honest is her way of resolving issues, but the husband still can't move past it, maybe the fault isn't entirely on one side. But does the husband have a right to feel this way? People have different thresholds for what's acceptable in a relationship. If the wife isn't acting on her feelings and is open about them, maybe it's the husband's insecurity or inability to accept certain behaviors that's the issue. \n\nHowever, if the husband feels that the emotional connection is gone and the marriage can't be salvaged, he might not be in the wrong for seeking divorce. It's about whether the situation is irreparable. The wife's actions might not be malicious, but if they've caused lasting damage, the decision to leave could be understandable. \n\nBut is it fair for him to end the marriage just because of a crush, even if it's a fantasy? Some might argue that as long as there's no actual infidelity, it's a personal issue that shouldn't lead to divorce. Others might say that if it's causing irreparable harm to the marriage, it's a valid reason. \n\nI think it's a bit nuanced. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong if he feels the relationship can't continue. But he could also be overreacting. The key here is whether the wife's actions are the dealbreaker. Since the wife is making efforts to change her behavior (cutting ties), maybe the problem is deeper, like the husband's own insecurities or the relationship's deterioration. \n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's making a difficult decision based on his feelings and the impact on their marriage. However, it's possible that the wife's openness is a positive, and the husband's reaction could stem from deeper issues. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting a divorce. If the wife admitted to having these feelings and the husband can't move past it despite her efforts, then it's a valid reason to seek divorce. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
