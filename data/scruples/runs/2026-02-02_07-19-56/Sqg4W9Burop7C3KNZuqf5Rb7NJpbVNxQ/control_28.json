We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife came to the author and jokingly asked about an open relationship, mentioning a specific coworker she's attracted to. The author felt hurt and angry, which makes sense. Jealousy and trust issues are big in relationships. The wife apologized multiple times and tried to reassure him that the coworker is just a physical attraction and that the husband is her real partner. She even said she wouldn't interact with him beyond work.\n\nThe author, however, felt that the relationship had fizzled out and wanted to distance himself. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, being honest about one's feelings is important, but so is respecting a partner's boundaries. The wife was honest, which is good, but the author feels betrayed. It's a tough spot. \n\nIn many relationships, the idea of a partner being physically attracted to someone else can be a deal-breaker. Even if it's just a crush and not an affair, the emotional impact can be significant. The author's decision to seek divorce is based on his hurt feelings, which is valid. However, some might argue that wanting to end a marriage over a crush, especially when the partner is committed and taking steps to address the issue, could be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut there's no right or wrong in these situations; it's about personal boundaries. If the author can't get over it, maybe it's not fair to expect him to stay in the marriage. The wife did what she could to make amends, but if the trust is broken, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting out. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because everyone has different thresholds for what they can accept in a relationship. His feelings are valid, and he's entitled to make that decision.\n"
