We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife told her husband she has a crush on her coworker, even joking about an open relationship. The husband is upset and considering divorce because he can't handle her having these feelings, even though she says she's committed to him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of a healthy relationship. Trust and communication are super important. The wife did communicate her feelings, which is good because hiding it would be worse. But the husband is hurt because he can't accept her having these attractions. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners should feel comfortable and respected. The wife's crush might not mean she's cheating, but for the husband, it's a dealbreaker. The question is whether his reaction is justified. \n\nOn one hand, everyone has fantasies or attractions, and the wife isn't acting on them. She's even cutting off contact with the coworker. So maybe the husband is overreacting. But on the other hand, if one partner's feelings make the other extremely uncomfortable, it's a valid reason to consider the relationship's future. \n\nIs it the husband's fault for not being able to handle her attractions? Or is it the wife's fault for having such a crush? The key here is mutual respect and whether both can meet each other's needs. If the husband can't get over it, he might be right to seek a divorce, but maybe he should work on trust instead. However, given that he's already decided the relationship has fizzled out, it's his choice. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's justified in prioritizing his own emotional well-being.\n"
