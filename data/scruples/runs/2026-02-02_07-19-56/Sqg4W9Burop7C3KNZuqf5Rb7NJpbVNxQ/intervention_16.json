We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife admitted to having a crush on her coworker and even joked about an open relationship. The husband is hurt and wants a divorce now. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife was honest about her feelings, which the husband found hurtful. She apologized multiple times and tried to cut off contact with the coworker. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out and can't be around her anymore.\n\nNow, is being in love with someone else a valid reason for divorce? Well, in many cultures, infidelity or emotional infidelity can be grounds for divorce. But here, the wife hasn't actually cheated, just has a crush and discussed it. The husband's reaction is emotional\u2014feeling hurt and wanting to end the marriage. However, is it fair for him to want a divorce just because his wife has a crush? That might depend on the relationship dynamics. \n\nThe wife was open and honest, which is a positive trait. She tried to make amends by cutting the coworker out of her life. But the husband felt that this wasn't enough. The wife's actions might not cross into actual betrayal, but the emotional impact is significant. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's response is to end the marriage. Is that overreacting? If a crush isn't an actual affair, maybe the husband is being too harsh. However, trust and emotional comfort in a relationship are important. If the husband can't move past this, it's valid for him to seek a divorce. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the wife hasn't done anything beyond having a crush and being honest about it, then the husband's decision might be his personal choice. But if the wife had been dishonest or acted on the crush, that would be different. In this case, since she was honest and tried to resolve it, the husband's hurt is valid, but wanting a divorce solely because of a crush might be his prerogative. \n\nTherefore, whether he's in the wrong could depend on whether the wife's actions were acceptable. Since she didn't actually act on the crush, the husband's reaction is his own emotional response. So maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship because of his feelings, but it's also possible that he's overreacting. But in terms of right and wrong, it's more about his personal choice rather than being in the wrong morally. So answer B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
