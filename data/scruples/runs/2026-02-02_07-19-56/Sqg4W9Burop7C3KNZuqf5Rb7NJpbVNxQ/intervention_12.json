We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife who admitted to having a crush on her coworker, and the husband wants a divorce. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which might have been a joke, but she mentioned a specific coworker. The husband was hurt by this, leading him to consider divorce. The wife apologized, tried to cut the coworker out of her life, and insists the husband is the real partner. \n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is wrong for wanting to leave. In relationships, trust and comfort are key. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's attraction, even if it's just a crush, it can damage the relationship. The wife's actions might not be malicious, but the husband's feelings are valid. The wife's behavior, even if not infidelity, can lead to hurt and distrust. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is reacting strongly to a crush that hasn't translated into action. Maybe he's overreacting. The wife is honest and trying to fix things. But the husband's emotional response is real. Divorce is a big step, but if the trust is broken and they can't reconcile, maybe it's justified. \n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to leave. The wife's actions, while maybe not a deal-breaker for others, caused significant hurt here. The answer would be B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
