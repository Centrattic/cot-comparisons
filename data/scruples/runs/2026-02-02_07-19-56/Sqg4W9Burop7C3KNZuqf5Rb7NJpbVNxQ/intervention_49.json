We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if it's their fault for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which the author took seriously. She mentioned a specific coworker and even joked about being \"wrecked\" by him. The author felt hurt and angry, especially because she gets flustered around this coworker. The wife apologized multiple times and tried to explain that it's just about physical attraction, comparing it to men watching porn. She also agreed to cut off contact with him outside work. However, the author still feels hurt and decided to separate.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are open communication and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is a positive step. She tried to make amends by limiting interactions. On the other hand, the author is feeling betrayed even if it's just a crush. Crushes can be a red flag for some people, especially if they feel their partner isn't fully committed. \n\nBut is the author wrong for wanting to leave? Well, relationships require both partners to be okay with each other's feelings. If the wife's crush is causing significant emotional distress and she's making efforts to address it, maybe the author is overreacting. However, if the author can't get past it and the trust is broken, then wanting to separate might be their right. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the author has valid reasons for feeling hurt. The wife's actions might not be malicious, but they can still impact the relationship's stability. It's a tough call. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they feel the relationship isn't sustainable. But the wife's honesty is a point in her favor. So maybe the answer is B (the author isn't in the wrong), because wanting to leave due to unresolved hurt is understandable, even if the wife made efforts.\n"
