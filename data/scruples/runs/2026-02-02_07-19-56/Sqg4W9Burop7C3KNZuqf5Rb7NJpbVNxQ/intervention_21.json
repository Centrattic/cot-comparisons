We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted about wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she's into. The husband got upset, they had discussions, she apologized, and now the husband wants to end the relationship. The wife is willing to cut off contact with the coworker.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust, boundaries in a relationship, and whether having a crush is a valid reason to end a marriage. The wife was honest, which the husband acknowledges, but he feels hurt and can't be around her anymore. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if they don't act on it, it can feel like a breach of trust to the other. The husband's reaction is understandable\u2014he's hurt because his wife is emotionally attached to someone else. However, the wife hasn't acted on the crush; she's just admitted to having feelings. She's also making efforts to address this by cutting off contact, which shows she's trying to respect the marriage's boundaries.\n\nBut the husband is choosing to end the relationship now. Is that right? Well, it's his choice, but does he have the right to be upset? Yes. But whether he's in the wrong for wanting a divorce... Well, if the wife is being honest and hasn't been unfaithful, maybe the husband is overreacting. The question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting to leave because of a crush. \n\nCrushes themselves aren't necessarily a deal-breaker. Many people have attractions to others. If the wife hasn't done anything physically or emotionally to cross the line beyond the crush, then the husband's decision to end the marriage might be based on something that's not a violation of the relationship's terms. However, if the husband can't trust his wife or feel secure, that's a personal issue. But the wife is trying to make amends. \n\nThe husband says the relationship has \"fizzled out,\" implying that trust is broken. If the wife is still committed to the marriage and is taking steps to address the issue, maybe the husband is the one choosing to end it without giving it a chance to resolve. That could mean he's in the wrong if he's not handling it through communication and support. \n\nOn the other hand, if the husband genuinely feels that the trust is irreparably damaged and that he can't move forward, then maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a gray area. Some people might say he's justified because of the emotional hurt, others might say a crush isn't enough to end a marriage. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife admitted to the crush, apologized, and is making efforts. The husband is responding with divorce. If the marriage was otherwise healthy, maybe the husband is overreacting. But if the husband's happiness is contingent on not being around someone who has these feelings, then he's not in the wrong to seek a divorce. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the wife's actions are a betrayal. Since she hasn't done anything physical or even necessarily emotional beyond the crush, the husband's decision to end the marriage might be his prerogative. However, some might argue that he's being too harsh. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (No), because he's not wrong to want to leave if he can't reconcile the hurt he's feeling, even if the wife is trying to change.\n"
