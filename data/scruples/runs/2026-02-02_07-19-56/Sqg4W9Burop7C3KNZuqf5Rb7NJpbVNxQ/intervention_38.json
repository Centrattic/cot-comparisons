We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong regarding wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife mentioned an open relationship and joked about having someone in mind, specifically a coworker she finds attractive. The husband was hurt and now wants a divorce. He feels that even though she's apologized and cut off contact with the coworker, something has changed between them. The wife says the coworker is just a physical specimen and that the husband is the real one.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking an opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nIn relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. If the husband feels betrayed by his wife's confession, even if it was in a joking manner, his reaction is valid. People have different thresholds for what they can handle in a relationship. The wife was honest, which is good, but the husband's hurt feelings are real. The key here is whether the wife's actions crossed a line that the husband couldn't handle. \n\nThe wife hasn't acted on the crush, just expressed it. The husband's decision to end the relationship is about his emotional response to her infatuation, not her cheating. In that case, he's within his rights to prioritize his own feelings. However, some might argue that wanting a divorce over a crush, especially if it's not ongoing, is harsh. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife was honest and didn't act on it, and the husband still can't move past it, maybe the husband is in the right to seek a divorce. However, others might say that the wife's confession, even if not a betrayal, caused unnecessary pain and the husband's reaction is extreme. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might think that wanting a divorce over a crush is overreacting, while others might support the husband's decision if he feels his trust is broken. It's subjective, but the fact that the wife was open and tried to make amends might support the husband's position that he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the husband's feelings are valid, and he's choosing to end the marriage based on his own emotional response. The wife didn't cheat, but the husband can't reconcile the hurt. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for wanting to leave.\n"
