We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife mentioned she has a crush on a coworker and even joked about an open relationship. The husband is hurt and wants a divorce because he can't handle being around her anymore, even though she apologized and tried to cut contact with the coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, divorce laws are based on no-fault, meaning you don't have to prove the other person is at fault. So legally, if the husband wants a divorce, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But the question is more about moral or social wrong, not legal per se. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually focuses on that.\n\nNext, the wife being honest about her feelings. Honesty in a relationship is important. If she admitted her crush, maybe she was being open, which is a good thing. But the husband's reaction is that it hurt him a lot, leading to wanting a divorce. Is he justified in that? Well, even if it was a fantasy or a joke, the emotional impact is real. People have different thresholds for what they can handle in a relationship. \n\nThe wife compared it to guys watching porn, implying it's not a real relationship. But that might not be the same as having a crush on someone you interact with daily. The husband might feel that the wife's infatuation is a breach of trust, even if there's no action. Jealousy is a common issue in relationships, and if the wife's behavior made him feel uncomfortable or disrespected, that's valid. \n\nAlso, the wife did apologize and made efforts to distance herself from the coworker. So maybe she's trying to fix the situation. The husband's decision to want a divorce might be more about the emotional damage and his inability to move past it, rather than her actions being inherently wrong. \n\nBut does the husband overreact? Some might say that having a crush doesn't equate to cheating or moving on from the relationship. The wife was honest, and the husband's reaction of wanting a divorce because of a crush could be seen as extreme. However, the husband's feelings are real, and if he can't reconcile past the hurt, it's understandable. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often weigh intentions and actions. The wife's intention was to be honest, even if it was a joke. The husband's intention is to protect his own feelings. So it's a bit of a gray area. But the husband is not at fault for being hurt and wanting to end the relationship if he can't get past it. He's not wrong for needing to walk away. \n\nWait, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's actions, while potentially hurtful, were part of a joke and she apologized. The husband's response is to want a divorce, which is his choice, but maybe he's not wrong to feel that way. The answer might be B (No), because wanting a divorce is his prerogative if the trust is broken, even if the wife intended no harm. However, some might argue he's overreacting. The key is that the wife's actions were not malicious, but the husband's reaction is based on his feelings. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting the divorce.\n"
