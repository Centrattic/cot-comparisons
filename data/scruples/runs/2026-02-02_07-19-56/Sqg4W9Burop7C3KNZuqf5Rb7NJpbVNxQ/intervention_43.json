We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The wife asked about an open relationship, which they discussed jokingly. She mentioned a coworker she's attracted to, comparing him to her teen fantasy. The husband is hurt and wants to end the marriage. The wife has apologized, claims it's just physical, and says he's the real partner. She's willing to cut off contact with the coworker.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. In a relationship, trust and comfort are key. If one partner feels betrayed or hurt by the other's feelings, even if those feelings aren't acted upon, it can be valid. The wife was honest, which is good, but the husband's reaction is about his emotional response. Divorce is a big step, so maybe the author is not in the wrong if he's not comfortable continuing the relationship. On the other hand, maybe he's overreacting if the wife isn't cheating and is willing to change. But it's his right to prioritize his feelings. So maybe answer B, No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
