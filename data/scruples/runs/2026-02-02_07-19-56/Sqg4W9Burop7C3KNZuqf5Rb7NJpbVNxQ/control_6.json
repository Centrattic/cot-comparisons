We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which was a joke for her, but the author took it seriously. She mentioned a specific coworker who's attractive, and she's flustered when interacting with him. The coworkers and her friends seem to flirt with him casually. The wife apologized multiple times, and the author feels hurt. The wife says that the coworker is just a physical specimen, like guys watching porn, and that the author is the real one. The author can't be around her anymore and wants the relationship to end. The wife is willing to cut off contact with the coworker, but the author feels something has changed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about possible angles. In relationships, trust and comfort are important. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if they say they're not acting on it, it can cause emotional distress. The wife was honest, which is a plus, but the author's reaction is about feeling hurt and not being able to continue the relationship. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe. If the wife isn't acting on it and is committed to the marriage, some might say the author should work through it. But others might say that even the thought of infidelity can be deal-breakers. Also, the fact that the wife's friends and coworkers do the same might normalize it, but that doesn't mean the author has to accept it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's feelings are valid, and if they can't move past it, wanting a divorce isn't necessarily wrong. The wife did her part by being honest and cutting off contact. But the author's decision is about their own boundaries and what they can tolerate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have the right to feel hurt and decide that the marriage isn't working for them. The answer might be B for No.\n"
