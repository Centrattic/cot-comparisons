We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on her coworker. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which they joked about. She mentioned a coworker who's a \"perfect physical specimen\" and that she wanted him to \"wreck her.\" The husband got really upset because it wasn't just a joke to him. She later apologized multiple times, and he feels awful for making her feel bad, but he's still hurt. The wife says the coworker is just a fantasy and that he's like a porn star, and she's committed to the husband. She's even willing to cut off contact with the coworker outside of work. The husband, however, feels the relationship has fizzled out and wants to not be around her anymore, considering divorce.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not in the wrong). \n\nLet me think about this from different angles. In relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. The wife admitted her feelings and fantasies, which she might consider harmless, but the husband is hurt by this. The wife apologized and tried to make amends by cutting off the coworker, but the husband still feels the relationship is over. \n\nIs the husband overreacting? Well, jealousy and insecurity can be real emotions. Even if the wife claims it's just a fantasy, if it upsets the husband to that extent, it's valid for him to feel that way. On the other hand, some people might argue that having a crush or fantasy about someone else, as long as there's no action, isn't a dealbreaker, and that the husband is being too controlling. \n\nBut in the scenario, the wife was open about it, and the husband didn't seem to have boundaries set beforehand. If they hadn't discussed what's acceptable in the relationship, the wife might not have known it would hurt him. However, once she realized it upset him and apologized, maybe the husband should work through the issue instead of wanting a divorce. But if the trust is broken and the husband can't be comfortable, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nAlso, the wife's actions (cutting off the coworker) show she respects the relationship. The husband's reaction is about his own feelings of hurt and loss of trust. Divorce is a big step, but if the emotional connection is gone, it's understandable. \n\nSo, is the husband wrong? It depends on whether his reaction is reasonable. If he's not the one who initiated the conversation about open relationships, maybe he's within his rights to feel hurt. However, the fact that the wife was honest and made amends might mean the husband is overreacting. \n\nIn some perspectives, having fantasies isn't a betrayal, so wanting a divorce over that could be seen as inconsiderate. But in others, if it's causing irreparable damage to the relationship, it's a valid reason. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife was honest and made efforts to fix it, but the husband still can't move past it, maybe the husband is not in the wrong for wanting to leave. On the other hand, maybe the wife's honesty was a strength, and the husband's inability to handle it is his issue. \n\nSo, in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and actions. The wife's intent was to be honest, which is positive. The husband's intent is to protect his feelings and the relationship's integrity. If the wife is willing to adjust, but the husband can't reconcile, it's a tough call. However, since the husband is the one choosing to end the relationship due to his hurt feelings, and the wife has taken steps to address it, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
