We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce from his wife because she has a crush on her coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The wife casually mentioned wanting to try an open relationship and joked about a specific coworker. The husband felt hurt, even though she clarified it was a fantasy similar to guys watching porn. She apologized and tried to cut the coworker out. The husband now feels the relationship has fizzled out and wants to end things.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So I need to consider both sides. \n\nThe wife was honest about her feelings, even if it was uncomfortable. She apologized and made changes. But the husband's reaction is also valid\u2014he's allowed to feel hurt and to want to leave if he can't get over it. Trust and emotional well-being in a marriage are important. \n\nHowever, the key question is whether the husband is in the wrong. He's not doing anything illegal or unethical by ending the marriage. He's justified in feeling hurt and making a decision based on that. Divorce is a personal choice, and unless he's being unreasonable without cause, he's not the asshole here.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife had been unfaithful, that would be different. But this is just a crush and fantasies. The husband's reaction is about emotional hurt, which is valid. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut I need to check if there's more to it. The wife tried to address the issue by cutting out the coworker. The husband's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious; it's about his own feelings. So he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his emotional needs.\n"
