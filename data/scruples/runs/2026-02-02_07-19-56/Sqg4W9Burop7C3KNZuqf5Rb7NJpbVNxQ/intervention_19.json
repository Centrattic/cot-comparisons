We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce due to their wife's crush on a coworker. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The wife admitted to having a crush on a coworker, even joking about an open relationship. The husband was hurt and wants to end the marriage. The wife has apologized, tried to cut off contact with the coworker, and claims the husband is the one she's in love with. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship, trust, and personal feelings.\n\nIn a committed relationship, sharing fantasies or attractions that make the partner uncomfortable can be a problem. The wife being honest is a good thing, but the husband's reaction is about feeling betrayed or disrespected. The question is whether the husband's desire for a divorce is justified. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, the wife's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if it's just a crush and not actual infidelity, the husband's emotional pain is valid. However, the wife's willingness to change her behavior (cutting off the coworker) shows she's taking it seriously. The husband's decision to end the marriage might be about his own needs and whether he can move past this. \n\nLegally and morally, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave if the trust is broken and the relationship is no longer fulfilling. The wife's actions, while perhaps not malicious, contributed to the breakdown. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but the situation is complex and depends on the couple's values and communication.\n"
