We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for considering a divorce because their wife has a crush on her coworker. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife asked about an open relationship, which was presented as a joke but then she mentioned a specific coworker. The husband got upset because she had someone in mind and reacts flustered when the coworker chats her up. The wife apologized multiple times and clarified that it's just a physical attraction, comparing it to men watching porn, and she's with the husband in reality. She's also agreed to cut the coworker out of her life.\n\nNow, the husband feels hurt and wants to end the relationship. The key here is whether his reaction is justified. The wife was honest, apologized, and is making changes to address his concerns. On the other hand, the husband's discomfort is valid since he's in a committed relationship and her feelings for someone else, even if not a full affair, can be damaging.\n\nIn relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. If one partner can't handle their partner's fantasies, even if they're not acting on them, that's a personal issue. But the wife's honesty and willingness to change might show she's not a bad partner. However, the husband's feeling that the relationship has fizzled out could be his way of coping with the hurt. \n\nLegally, in some places, infidelity is a factor in divorce, but here, there's no actual infidelity\u2014just a crush. Emotionally, though, the husband's feelings matter. He might be in the right to want to leave if he can't trust her, but others might argue he's overreacting because it's just a fantasy. \n\nConsidering both sides, the answer isn't black and white. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife is honest and trying to fix things, the husband's decision to leave could be seen as a personal choice rather than being wrong. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
