We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship jokingly and mentioned having a coworker in mind. The husband was upset because she was actually lusting after someone else, even if it's just a fantasy. She apologized, and he's hurt. She says she's into the coworker's looks and compares it to guys watching porn, but claims the husband is the real partner. He wants to end the relationship, even though she's trying to cut off contact with the coworker.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So, I need to analyze both sides. \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's hurt because his wife is lusting after someone else. Even if it's just a fantasy, it might feel like a betrayal. He's feeling insecure or unloved. The fact that she's flustered when the coworker chats her up and that others also find him attractive might make him feel inadequate. He's honest about his feelings and wants to leave because he can't handle the emotional turmoil.\n\nOn the wife's side, she was open and honest, even if it was in a joking way. She apologized and tried to make changes, like cutting off contact. She says it's just physical attraction, not actual infidelity. She mentions it's like how men watch porn, implying it's a common fantasy. She's still committed to the relationship and feels bad about hurting him.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if not acting on it, it can cause emotional distress. However, fantasies themselves are common and not necessarily a deal-breaker. The key is how each partner handles it. The husband might feel that his boundaries were crossed, but the wife didn't engage in any actual cheating. She was honest, which is a positive point.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems extreme to some. Wanting a divorce over a crush that hasn't led to action might be seen as overreacting. However, if the emotional pain is too much for him to handle, then his decision is valid. The question is whether the wife's actions were wrong. Since she didn't cheat and was honest, maybe the husband is wrong to end the relationship. But if the trust is broken and he can't move past it, maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the husband might need to consider if his jealousy is justified. If the wife isn't acting on her feelings, but just has a crush, is that something the husband should accept? Some might say he's being too possessive, while others might say it's okay to feel hurt. The fact that she's making efforts to avoid contact could help, but if the emotional damage is done, then the husband's decision isn't entirely his fault.\n\nIn the end, whether the husband is in the wrong depends on cultural and personal values. The wife's actions might not be morally wrong, but the husband's emotional response is valid. However, wanting a divorce just because of a crush that hasn't led to action might be seen as overreacting. But if the relationship has already broken down, maybe it's not his fault. It's a bit of a grey area. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the husband's feelings are legitimate, and if the relationship is beyond repair, ending it isn't wrong. However, some might argue A if they think it's too harsh. But given the information, B makes sense.\n"
