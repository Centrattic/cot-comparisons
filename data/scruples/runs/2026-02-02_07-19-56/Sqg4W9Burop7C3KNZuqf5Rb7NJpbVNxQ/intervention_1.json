We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether wanting a divorce because the wife has a crush on a coworker is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, not seriously, but mentioned a specific coworker. The author felt hurt and decided to end the relationship. The wife apologized multiple times, claims it's just a fantasy and that he's her physical ideal. She compares it to guys watching porn. The author feels he can't be around her now, even though she's trying to cut ties with the coworker. The author is torn because he appreciates her honesty but feels hurt.\n\nSo, what's the main issue here? Jealousy or insecurity? The key points are: the wife didn't act on the crush, she was honest, and she tried to make amends. The author is choosing to end the marriage because of her feelings for someone else, even if it's just a fantasy. But is that a valid reason?\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are important. The wife's honesty might be a positive, but the author's reaction is to end the relationship. Depending on cultural or personal values, some might say that having a crush isn't a deal-breaker unless it leads to actual infidelity. Others might argue that trust is broken if one partner has such feelings, even if they don't act on them.\n\nBut the wife didn't have an affair. She expressed attraction, which is different from cheating. The author might be struggling with insecurity, which is a personal issue. In that case, maybe the author is projecting his own insecurities onto the situation. However, if the wife's behavior made the author feel uncomfortable and distrustful, then it's valid for him to want to leave. \n\nMarriage counseling might be an option, but if the author feels the relationship has \"fizzled out,\" maybe the marriage was already having issues. But is the author justified in ending it solely because of a crush? That's the crux.\n\nIn some perspectives, wanting a divorce over a crush without cheating is taking it too far. The wife made it clear she's committed. In others, if the author can't move past it, ending the relationship is understandable. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author has the right to his feelings, but ending a marriage over someone else's fantasies might be extreme. However, if the emotional pain is too much, it's his choice. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer isn't straightforward. But given that the wife hasn't cheated and is trying to address the issue, maybe the author is being overly harsh. So I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
