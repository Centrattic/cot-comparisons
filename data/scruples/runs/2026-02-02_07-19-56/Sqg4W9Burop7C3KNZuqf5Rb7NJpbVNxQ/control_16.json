We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned a specific coworker, and the husband was upset. The wife then apologized multiple times and tried to cut off contact with the coworker. The husband feels hurt and thinks the relationship has fizzled out.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife being honest about her feelings might be a positive, but the husband's reaction is about feeling insecure or betrayed. Whether the husband is in the wrong depends on context. If the wife wasn't acting on the crush and was making efforts to address the issue, maybe the husband's reaction is more about his own feelings rather than her actions. However, if the husband can't move past this and the trust is broken, it's a valid reason to consider divorce. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the husband's reaction is reasonable. Since the wife isn't cheating but has a crush, and the husband is struggling with the emotional impact, it's a complex situation. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The wife's honesty could be seen as a strength, but the husband's decision to end the relationship might be his personal choice, not necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (No), because he's not in the wrong for feeling hurt and wanting to end the marriage due to his own emotional state, even if the wife hasn't done anything illegal or actively harmful.\n"
