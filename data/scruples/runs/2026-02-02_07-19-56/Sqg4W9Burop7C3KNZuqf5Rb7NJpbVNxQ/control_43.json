We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on her coworker. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the situation: The wife approached her husband about the idea of an open relationship, jokingly mentioned having someone in mind (a coworker), and made a comment about wanting this coworker to \"wreck her.\" The husband was upset and felt hurt. The wife apologized multiple times, clarified that it's just a physical attraction, and said it's like guys watching porn. She's willing to stop interacting with the coworker outside of work. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out and wants to distance himself.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Communication and Honesty**: The wife was honest about her feelings, which is a positive in a relationship. Honesty is important for trust. However, the way she expressed her crush might have been inappropriate depending on the context and the husband's comfort level.\n\n2. **Boundaries in Relationships**: In a committed relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The wife's crush on her coworker, even if it's just a fantasy, might cross a boundary that the husband is not comfortable with. The husband's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal or insecurity, which is valid for him.\n\n3. **Impact on the Relationship**: The husband feels he can't be around her anymore, indicating that the trust might be broken. Trust is a crucial element in a marriage. If one partner feels the other is prioritizing someone else, even if it's just a crush, it can lead to emotional distress.\n\n4. **Willingness to Resolve the Issue**: The wife is trying to mitigate the problem by cutting ties with the coworker beyond work. The husband, however, is not willing to continue the relationship, which might be due to lingering hurt. It's a matter of whether the husband's reaction is proportional to the situation.\n\n5. **Expectations and Jealousy**: The husband might have expected his wife to not have such a crush, and the wife might not have realized how hurtful her comments were. Jealousy is a natural emotion but needs to be managed through communication. The wife's perspective is that it's a fantasy, similar to men watching porn, which the husband might find dismissive.\n\n6. **Cultural and Personal Values**: Different people have different thresholds for what they can accept in a relationship. What one person sees as a harmless crush, another might see as a breach of trust. This is subjective and depends on the couple's agreed-upon norms.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the husband's decision to want a divorce stems from feeling hurt and unable to move past his wife's actions. While the wife was honest, the husband's emotional response is valid. The wife may have not intended to cause harm but didn't consider how her actions affected him. In terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the husband's reaction is based on his personal feelings and the impact on their relationship. Since the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong, it's possible that he isn't, as it's about his emotional response and the state of the relationship. However, some might argue that wanting a divorce over a crush, even if it's a dealbreaker for him, is a personal choice and not inherently wrong.\n"
