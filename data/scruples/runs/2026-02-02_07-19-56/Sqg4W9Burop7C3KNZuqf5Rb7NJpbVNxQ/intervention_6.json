We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, so the user wants an analysis of whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, jokingly, but actually had a co-worker in mind. She mentioned this guy as her \"perfect physical specimen\" and even made a joke about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband was upset, felt hurt, and now is considering divorce. The wife has apologized multiple times, claims she's loyal, and is willing to cut contact with the coworker. The husband feels that the relationship has changed and he can't be around her anymore.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The wife's actions: she was honest about her feelings but in a hypothetical or joking context. She might have crossed a line by mentioning a specific person, especially if it made the husband uncomfortable. However, she's shown willingness to address the issue by cutting off contact with the coworker. The husband's reaction is to want a divorce, which seems extreme, especially since the wife hasn't acted on her crush, just acknowledged it. \n\nBut in a relationship, trust and comfort are crucial. If one partner feels their spouse is lusting after someone else, even hypothetically, it can be a deal-breaker. The husband might be justified in feeling betrayed, depending on the boundaries they had. However, the wife was honest and apologetic, which could mean she didn't intend to hurt him. \n\nThe key here is whether the wife's actions were inappropriate. Expressing attraction to someone else, even as a fantasy or joke, can be seen as disrespectful, but since she's not acting on it, it's a gray area. The husband's response of wanting a divorce might be an overreaction if there's no actual infidelity. But if the husband can't overcome the hurt and the trust is broken, then his decision isn't unjustified. \n\nIn some relationships, such feelings are considered a problem, and the husband might have valid reasons to end it. However, the wife's honesty and attempts to fix the situation could mitigate blame. The question is whether the husband's reaction is in the wrong. If the relationship isn't salvageable, maybe not. But if he's ending it without giving it a chance, he might be at fault. \n\nConsidering all factors, the husband's desire to end the relationship might not make him the asshole, especially if he can't reconcile the hurt. But the wife's actions, while honest, could be seen as crossing a boundary. However, since she didn't act on the crush, the husband's response might still be acceptable. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because his feelings are valid if the trust is broken.\n"
