We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is considering divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. The wife brought up an open relationship joke, mentioned the coworker, and gets flustered when he chats her up. The wife has apologized multiple times, and the author feels hurt. The wife says the coworker is just a physical specimen and that the author is the real one. They've talked about it, and the wife is cutting off contact with him outside work. The author feels the relationship has fizzled out and wants to be away from their wife.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The wife admitted to having a crush, which the author found hurtful. The wife has apologized and is taking steps to address it (cutting off contact). The author is hurt and considering divorce. But is that justified?\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if they don't act on it, it can cause emotional distress. The author's feelings are valid here. However, the wife is being honest and trying to fix the situation. The author might be overreacting if the wife isn't actually cheating but just has a crush. Divorce over a crush without infidelity is a big step. But if the author can't get over it, maybe they are right to want to end the relationship.\n\nBut then again, maybe the author is being too harsh. Crushes are common, and the wife isn't acting on it. The author's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy. The wife is open and apologetic. However, the author's right to feel hurt is real. So, is the author wrong for wanting to leave? It's a tough call.\n\nIn some perspectives, wanting to end a marriage because of a crush, even if not cheating, could be seen as overreacting. Others might say if it's causing significant distress and the marriage is suffering, it's reasonable. The key factors are the wife's actions: not acting on the crush, apologizing, and cutting contact. The author's response is to want a divorce, which might be extreme unless the wife's behavior is beyond a crush. Since the wife isn't cheating, just lusting, the author's reaction could be seen as inconsiderate of her honesty and efforts to fix things. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong for wanting to end it over something that isn't a betrayal.\n"
