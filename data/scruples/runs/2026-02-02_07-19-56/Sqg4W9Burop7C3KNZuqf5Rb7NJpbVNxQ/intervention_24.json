  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting a divorce from my wife because she has a crush on her coworker?\nAbout a month ago my wife asked me if I'm ever willing to try an open relationship. We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is about a husband considering divorce because his wife admitted to having a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife brought up an open relationship joke, mentioned her coworker as someone she's attracted to, and the husband felt hurt and wants to leave. The wife has apologized multiple times and tried to distance herself from the coworker. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out.\n\nSo, the key points: The wife was honest about her feelings, which was appreciated, but the husband is hurt. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting a divorce. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The wife's honesty might be commendable, but the husband's feelings are valid too. Jealousy and insecurity can play a role here. However, deciding to end a marriage over someone else's attraction might be seen as a personal choice. \n\nI need to consider if the husband's reaction is disproportionate. The wife hasn't acted on the crush; she just acknowledged it. The husband might need to work on trust issues, but if the trust is broken beyond repair, then wanting to leave isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that it's unfair to end the marriage because of unacted-on feelings. But others might say that the foundation of the relationship is compromised if one partner has such attractions. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the husband's decision is based on valid reasons. Since the wife hasn't cheated, the husband's choice is his, but he might need to reflect if his reaction is justified. However, he's allowed to feel hurt and decide to leave if he can't reconcile. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because it's a personal choice versus the impact on the wife.\n"
