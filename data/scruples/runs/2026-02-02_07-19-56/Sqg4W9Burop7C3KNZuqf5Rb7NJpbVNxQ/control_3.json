We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife mentioned wanting an open relationship and joked about a specific coworker. The author was hurt and felt it wasn't just a joke. The wife apologized and said the coworker is just a physical specimen, comparing it to guys watching porn. She also said she's loyal to the author.\n\nThe author feels the relationship has fizzled out and can't be around the wife anymore. The wife is trying to cut the coworker out of her life. \n\nNow, the key points here: communication is important in relationships. The wife was honest, which is a positive. But the author felt betrayed even though there's no actual infidelity. Crushes can happen, but they might cause discomfort for partners. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction is justified. In many relationships, having a crush isn't grounds for divorce. However, if it's causing emotional pain and affecting trust, it's a valid concern. The author might be overreacting, but their feelings are real. The wife's comparison to porn might not fully address the emotional aspect for the author. \n\nSince the wife is honest and willing to cut the coworker out, maybe the issue is more about the author's insecurity or the boundary between fantasy and reality. However, if the author can't reconcile this despite the wife's efforts, wanting to end the marriage isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the wife didn't violate any actual agreements (no affair), then the author's decision is based on personal discomfort. That might make the author not in the wrong, but also not necessarily right. However, the answer options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nConsidering that the wife was honest and tried to make amends, but the author is struggling with his feelings, it's a complex situation. But since there's no actual betrayal, the author's decision to end the marriage might be seen as his choice, not necessarily wrong. So answer B.\n"
