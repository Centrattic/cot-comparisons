We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the wife told her husband she has a crush on a coworker. They discussed it, and the husband is really hurt and wants a divorce. The wife apologized and said she's not interested beyond physical attraction, comparing it to guys watching porn. The husband feels he can't be around her anymore, and the wife is trying to cut off the coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. In a relationship, trust and communication are key. The wife was honest about her feelings, which is commendable. But having a crush on someone else, even if it's just a fantasy, can be really hurtful. The husband's reaction is understandable because he's feeling betrayed or insecure. However, wanting a divorce over a crush that the wife isn't acting on might be extreme. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might not be doing anything wrong by acknowledging her attraction to another person, as long as it's not affecting their relationship through actions. But the husband's feelings are valid too. The line between personal desires and relationship boundaries can be blurry here. If the husband can't move past this, maybe the marriage isn't working for him, but does that make him in the wrong? \n\nAlso, the wife did apologize and try to resolve the issue by cutting off contact with the coworker. She's committed to the marriage. The husband's decision to end the relationship might be about his own insecurities rather than her actions. But if he can't trust her or feel secure, staying might be painful. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The wife opened up, which is good, but the husband's reaction is extreme. The question is whether the husband has a right to be hurt and seek a divorce. Since he's the one deciding to end the marriage, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue he's overreacting. However, in a marriage, if one person can't trust the other, the relationship is over. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
