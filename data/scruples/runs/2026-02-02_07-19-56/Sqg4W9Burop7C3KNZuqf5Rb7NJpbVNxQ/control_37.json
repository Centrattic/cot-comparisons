We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker.\n\nFirst, the wife approached the husband about an open relationship, which is a big deal. She mentioned a specific coworker she's been attracted to. The husband felt hurt and angry because it wasn't just a hypothetical. The wife apologized multiple times, but the husband still feels hurt. She says the coworker is just a physical fantasy and that the husband is her real partner. She's willing to cut off contact with the coworker. The husband is considering leaving the relationship because he can't be around her anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. In a relationship, trust and emotional security are important. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if they don't act on it, it can cause hurt. However, the wife was honest and even tried to make amends by cutting ties with the coworker. The husband's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal and hurt. On the other hand, wanting a divorce over someone else's crush might be seen as overreacting if there's no actual infidelity. \n\nBut in relationships, how people feel matters. Even if there's no physical cheating, emotional or psychological reasons can justify ending a relationship. The husband is hurt because the crush exists and affects their dynamic. The wife admitted her feelings and tried to address it. The husband's decision to seek a divorce is a personal choice. Whether he's in the wrong depends on perspectives. Some might say he's right to prioritize his emotional well-being, while others might think he's overreacting. However, since the wife didn't act on the crush and was honest, the husband's decision isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. However, the key is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife didn't cheat and communicated, the husband isn't wrong for feeling hurt. So answer B.\n"
