We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. The situation is that the wife jokingly mentioned an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she's attracted to. The author is hurt and wants a divorce, while the wife has apologized and said she's committed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The wife was honest about her feelings, even if it was in a joking context. Honesty is important in relationships, so maybe she's not wrong for being open. However, the author feels betrayed and can't handle it. That's a valid emotional response. But does that make him in the wrong?\n\nThe wife says she's committed and that the coworker is just a physical specimen, comparing it to guys watching porn. That's a common analogy, but it might not address the emotional impact on the partner. The author's reaction is about trust and feeling uncomfortable being around his wife anymore. Divorce is a major step, but if he's not happy, is he justified?\n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In many societies, even a crush can be seen as a betrayal, especially if it's causing marital distress. However, others might say that having a crush doesn't equate to cheating and that the author is overreacting. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. The wife tried to apologize and change her behavior, but the author feels the relationship has fizzled out. \n\nThe author's decision to want a divorce is based on his feelings of hurt and loss of trust. While it's a significant decision, his emotional response is valid. However, is he in the wrong for ending the marriage? Not necessarily. But is he wrong for not being able to move past this? That's debatable. The wife's honesty is a positive, but the author's reaction is about his own boundaries and what he can tolerate. \n\nUltimately, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. From a relationship standpoint, wanting a divorce because of a crush might be seen as too extreme, but if the author can't reconcile and the marriage is causing him pain, he's acting within his rights. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, as his decision is based on his emotional well-being.\n"
