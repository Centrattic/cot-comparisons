We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife told her husband about having a crush on a coworker. They had a joke conversation about an open relationship, and she mentioned this coworker specifically. The husband got really upset, felt hurt, and now wants a divorce. The wife apologized multiple times, tried to cut off contact with the coworker, and says the husband is the one she's with. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to end the marriage because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Trust and communication are crucial in a relationship. The wife was honest about her feelings, even if it was in a joking manner. She later apologized, which shows she recognized that it might have upset her husband. The husband's reaction is about feeling hurt and not being able to be around her anymore. \n\nBut is it wrong for him to feel that way? Well, everyone has different boundaries in a relationship. What one person finds acceptable, another might not. The wife's actions, while honest, might have crossed the husband's boundaries, leading to his hurt feelings. However, the husband's response is to want a divorce, which seems extreme if the wife was honest and willing to change her behavior (cutting off the coworker). \n\nOn the other hand, having a crush on someone else, even if just a fantasy, can be seen as a breach of trust or emotional commitment. The husband's hurt is valid, but does that justify ending the marriage? The wife's actions might not be a deal-breaker for some people, but for others, it could be a sign of deeper issues. The key here is whether the wife's actions were a one-time incident and if she's making efforts to fix the situation. The husband might need to consider if the issue is the crush itself or a lack of trust in the relationship overall. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's reaction is proportional. The wife was honest, apologized, and took steps to avoid contact. The husband might still be in pain, but wanting a divorce over a crush that she's not acting on could be seen as overreacting. However, if the husband feels that his emotional needs aren't being met and the relationship has fizzled out, then his desire for a divorce might be justified from his perspective. But is he in the wrong? Probably not, because relationships are about mutual respect and comfort. If the wife's actions caused enough distress that the husband can't continue, then it's not necessarily his fault. But maybe he should have tried working through the issue instead of jumping to divorce. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The situation is complex, but his feelings are valid, and boundaries in relationships are personal. Wanting out if the trust is broken isn't wrong.\n"
