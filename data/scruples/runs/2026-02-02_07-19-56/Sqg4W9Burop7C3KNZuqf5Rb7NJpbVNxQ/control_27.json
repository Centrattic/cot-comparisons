We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned a coworker, joked about wanting to be \"wrecked\" by him, and gets flustered when he chats her up. The husband is hurt and wants a divorce, even though she apologized and says he's the real one. She's willing to cut off the coworker from her friends but the husband can't be around her anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here: The wife is honest about her feelings, but the husband feels betrayed and hurt. Is it the husband's fault for being upset, or is he overreacting? \n\nIn relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. Even if the crush is just a fantasy, the fact that she's lusting after someone else can be painful. The husband might feel insecure or that the emotional connection is gone. On the other hand, she's being open and trying to make amends. \n\nBut the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. If he can't handle it and the marriage is suffering, maybe his reaction is justified. However, wanting a divorce over a crush might be a bit extreme if there's no actual infidelity yet. \n\nStill, in a marriage, both partners need to feel secure. If the wife's fantasies are causing significant distress and she's not able to fully cut ties (even if she tries), the husband's decision to seek divorce might be his way of protecting himself. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that he's being too harsh. However, the wife's actions\u2014admitting to a crush and the husband's emotional response\u2014are valid. The answer probably leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave because the emotional hurt is real, even if it's not an actual affair.\n"
