We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned having a coworker in mind, and joked about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband was upset, felt hurt, and now wants a divorce. The wife has apologized multiple times, says she sees him as a physical specimen and that he's just a fantasy, like guys watching porn. She's also willing to cut off contact with him outside work. \n\nThe key points here are about trust, boundaries, and emotional impact. In a relationship, trust is crucial. The wife's actions\u2014admitting to having a crush and even joking about an open relationship with a specific person\u2014might have crossed a line for the husband. Even if it's just a fantasy and not an action, emotions can feel real and hurtful. \n\nThe husband's reaction is about feeling hurt and not wanting to be around her anymore. The wife is open and apologized, but maybe the husband can't move past it. Now, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal norms and relationship expectations. Some might say that having a crush isn't cheating, but the way it was presented (joking about an open relationship, referencing a specific person) could be a breach of trust. \n\nBut others might argue that having fantasies or crushes without action isn't the same as infidelity, and the husband overreacting. However, relationships are about mutual respect and comfort. If the wife's behavior made the husband uncomfortable and he can't reconcile that, it's his right to seek a divorce. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. However, in this case, the wife did share her feelings, which could be seen as honest, but the husband's feelings of being hurt are valid. Since he's the one initiating the divorce due to her crush, which isn't an actual affair, some might think he's overreacting. But others might side with him if he can't trust her anymore. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf the answer is A (yes, he's wrong), it would be because wanting divorce over a crush without action is excessive. If B (no), it's because his feelings are valid and he's entitled to leave if trust is broken. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). The husband is not in the wrong because he's entitled to his feelings, and if he can't trust his wife, the relationship's foundation is compromised. Even if the wife didn't act on the crush, the emotional impact is real. So, he's justified in wanting to end the marriage.\n"
