We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife mentioned the open relationship idea jokingly, but then brought up a specific coworker. The husband is hurt because she's lusting after someone else, even if it's just a fantasy. She apologized and tried to cut him out, but the husband feels the relationship has fizzled.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: the wife's honesty about her crush, the husband's reaction, and whether his decision to want a divorce is justified. The user thinks the author (husband) is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nIn relationships, trust and comfort are crucial. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's fantasies or attractions, it's a problem. The wife might believe that having a crush is normal, like how men watch porn, but the husband is hurt and wants to leave. The fact that she tried to address it by cutting the coworker out shows she's trying, but the husband still feels it's over.\n\nBut is it the husband's fault? Well, if he can't get over it, maybe he's right to seek a divorce. People have different boundaries. If the wife's actions, even if not physical, breach what the husband can tolerate, then his reaction might be valid. However, some might argue that having a crush isn't cheating and the husband is overreacting.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's honesty is a positive, but the husband's emotional response is valid too. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. But in the end, if the husband can't move past it and the wife's actions have caused lasting damage to their trust and emotional connection, then his decision might be understandable. So, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
