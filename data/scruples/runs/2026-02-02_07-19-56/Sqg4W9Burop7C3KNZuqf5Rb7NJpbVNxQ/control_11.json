We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a co-worker. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned having someone in mind, a co-worker. She joked about wanting him to \"wreck her,\" which upset the husband. He's hurt and considering divorce. She apologized, says he's the real one, and that the co-worker is just a physical specimen. She's willing to cut ties with him. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out.\n\nHmm. So, is he in the wrong? Well, infidelity or emotional attachment can be a dealbreaker for some. The wife didn't cheat, but she had feelings and fantasies. The husband might feel betrayed even if it's not physical. But maybe he's overreacting? The key points are communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe wife was honest, which is good, but the husband's reaction is about trust and emotional hurt. If he can't move past it, maybe he's not wrong to want out. But is it wrong to react this way? It's subjective. Some people might think he's being too sensitive, others might think she crossed a line by even considering it. Divorce is a big step, so maybe he should consider counseling first. But the question is about right or wrong. \n\nIn many relationships, mutual respect and boundaries are crucial. If the husband feels his boundaries were violated by her fantasies, he has a right to feel hurt. However, the wife didn't act on the crush, just acknowledged feelings. So maybe the husband is in the right to want to end things if he's not comfortable. But others might argue that she was honest, tried to fix it, and he's being too harsh. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. But the options are A or B. The answer depends on cultural or personal values. If the story is from the husband's perspective, he's in the right because he's hurt and wants out. The wife made a choice that hurt him, so he's not wrong to seek a divorce. So answer B.\n"
