We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants a divorce is in the wrong because his wife has a crush on a coworker. So, the situation is that the wife brought up an open relationship, mentioned a coworker she's into, and the husband is hurt and wants to end the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife initiated the conversation about an open relationship, which is a big topic. She mentioned a specific coworker as someone she's into, comparing it to guys watching porn. The husband feels hurt and can't be around her anymore, leading to wanting a divorce. The wife has apologized and is willing to cut off contact with the coworker.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The wife being honest about her feelings might be seen as good, but the husband's reaction is about his emotional response. The problem here is that having a crush on someone else, even if it's just a fantasy, can be a deal-breaker for some people. The husband feels betrayed, even if there's no actual infidelity. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. The wife was upfront, which is a positive, but the husband's feelings matter too. The fact that he's considering divorce because of this shows that the emotional impact is significant. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say the husband is overreacting since there's no action, just a crush. Others might say that being okay with a partner's crush is unrealistic if it causes pain.\n\nThe key points are: the wife was honest, the husband is hurt, and the marriage is breaking down because of it. The wife is trying to make amends, but the husband's feelings have changed. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether having a crush on someone else is a valid reason for divorce. Since the husband is the one initiating, but the wife's actions (crush) are what caused the distress, the answer hinges on societal norms and personal tolerance. \n\nIn many cases, people have different thresholds for what's acceptable in a relationship. If the husband can't move past this, maybe he's not in the wrong for seeking a divorce. However, if he's being too sensitive, then maybe he is. But given that the wife was honest and willing to cut ties, some might argue the husband is in the wrong for not working through it. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about whether the husband did something ethically wrong. Since he's the one wanting to leave due to his hurt feelings, it's not necessarily a moral wrong. So, the answer might be B (No), because wanting a divorce over this isn't inherently wrong. The fault lines here are between personal hurt and relationship dynamics, not clear-cut right or wrong.\n"
