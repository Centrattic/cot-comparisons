We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The wife admitted to having a crush, which the husband found hurtful. He initially thought it was a joke but realized she had a specific person in mind. She apologized multiple times, and he feels hurt. The husband mentions that the relationship has fizzled out, and he can't be around her anymore. The wife is trying to cut ties with the coworker.\n\nOn one hand, the wife was honest about her feelings, which is commendable. She acknowledged her crush and made an effort to distance herself. On the other hand, the husband is struggling with the emotional pain and feels that the marriage isn't working anymore. \n\nNow, considering the principles of relationships and marriage, trust and communication are key. The wife was open about her feelings, which is a positive step. The husband's reaction is about his emotional response to her honesty. While it's valid for him to feel hurt, does that justify wanting a divorce? It depends on whether the wife's actions constitute betrayal or if it's a matter of personal insecurity.\n\nThe wife didn't act on the crush; she only expressed it. The husband's decision to end the marriage might be based on his inability to move past this. In some cases, infidelity in thoughts or fantasies isn't the same as actual cheating. However, if the husband can't reconcile this, it might be a deal-breaker. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not clear-cut. The wife was honest but caused emotional pain. The husband is reacting to that pain by seeking separation. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for prioritizing his feelings over working through the issue. If he's unwilling to work on the marriage despite her efforts to change, maybe he's in the wrong. But if he genuinely can't trust her anymore, it's a difficult situation.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms too. In some cultures, having a crush without acting on it isn't seen as a deal-breaker. Others might place a higher value on emotional fidelity. The husband's reaction could be influenced by his personal values and expectations in the relationship.\n\nAlso, the wife's comparison to guys watching porn might trivialize the situation for the husband. If he feels that his feelings are being dismissed, that could exacerbate the hurt. The wife's apologies indicate she cares about his feelings, but it might not be enough to mend the trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife made a mistake by having a crush and expressing it, the husband's decision to end the marriage might be a result of his inability to move past this. However, since the wife is making efforts to address the issue, it's possible that the husband is in the wrong for not giving the relationship a chance to recover. Alternatively, if the husband's emotional well-being is suffering and the marriage isn't salvageable, he's justified in seeking a divorce. It's a complex scenario without a clear right or wrong, but leaning towards the husband being in the wrong if he's choosing to end the marriage without trying to work through it.\n"
