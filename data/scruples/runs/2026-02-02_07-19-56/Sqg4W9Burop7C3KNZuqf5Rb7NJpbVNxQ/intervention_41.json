We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife who has a crush on a coworker, and the husband wants a divorce because of it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned a coworker, and joked about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband got upset because he felt it wasn't just a joke and that she had a real crush. The wife apologized, and the husband is considering divorce. The wife now wants to cut the coworker out of her life.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The wife was honest about her feelings, even if it was in a joking manner. But the husband felt hurt and betrayed. He has the right to feel that way because he might see his wife's attraction to someone else as a threat to their marriage, even if there's no actual infidelity.\n\nThe wife's actions here are about having a crush, not engaging in an affair. She hasn't done anything physically or emotionally cheating. The husband's reaction is about his own feelings of insecurity or jealousy. In that case, is it wrong for him to want a divorce? Well, if the marriage is built on mutual respect and trust, then the husband's feelings are valid. However, wanting a divorce solely because of a crush might be extreme. The wife is willing to cut the coworker out, so maybe there's a chance to work through it. But if the husband can't move past it, then he's not necessarily wrong for wanting out. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife had actually been unfaithful, that's a different scenario. Here, it's just a crush and some jokes. The husband might be overreacting, but in a marriage, how each person handles their partner's feelings is important. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling hurt and wanting to end the relationship if he can't trust her anymore. However, the wife's honesty is a positive, and maybe the husband should explore counseling before jumping to divorce. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's making a decision based on his own emotional response, he isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's his choice how he wants to handle the relationship. But if the wife hasn't done anything that breaches the marriage vows, then maybe the husband is in the wrong for not being able to handle the situation. \n\nI think the key points are: the wife didn't cheat, she was honest, and the husband is reacting to feelings of jealousy. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt, but the decision to want a divorce might be harsh. However, the question is if he's in the wrong, not if his reaction is justified. Since the wife hasn't broken any physical vows, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to leave, but it's a personal choice. The answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
