We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she has a crush on. The husband got upset, they had discussions, she apologized, and now he wants a divorce. The key points here are about consent, honesty, and whether the crush is a valid reason for divorce.\n\nIn many relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The wife was open about her feelings, which is good. The husband felt hurt and wants to end the marriage. Divorce is a personal decision, but is it wrong to want it in this case? \n\nLegally, in many places, wanting a divorce isn't about being right or wrong but about the decision to end the marriage. Emotionally, the husband is hurt. The wife may not have done anything illegal or necessarily wrong in terms of the relationship rules they had. If they had agreed that the relationship should be monogamous, her having a crush might be a breach, but if they hadn't discussed boundaries, maybe not. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They mention that the wife apologized, tried to cut off the coworker, and the husband is being hurt. But the husband might feel that the trust is broken. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting divorce. \n\nIf the wife didn't engage in an affair and was honest, maybe the husband's reaction is overly sensitive. But if he feels the relationship is over and can't move past it, is he wrong to want to leave? In some perspectives, if the wife's actions don't constitute cheating and she's being honest, the husband might be overreacting. So, the author could be in the wrong because he's ending the marriage over something that doesn't involve betrayal. \n\nAlternatively, if the husband can't handle the emotional pain and feels the relationship is irreparable, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a tough call. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife's actions are within the boundaries they previously agreed upon, then the husband is within his rights to want to leave, but if they had an implicit agreement of monogamy and she's violating it, maybe he's justified. \n\nIn this case, the wife didn't engage in an affair or have physical contact. The husband is upset about the emotional attachment. It's more about emotional trust. Some might say that having a crush is part of being human and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem if the relationship is otherwise healthy. So the author might be in the wrong for wanting to leave over a crush that's not resulting in actual infidelity. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (author in the wrong) because the wife was honest, didn't cheat, and the author is ending the marriage over a crush that's not a breach of trust in a monogamous relationship. But if the husband feels the relationship is over and that's his choice, maybe it's B. However, societal views often consider wanting a divorce due to jealousy without actual infidelity as the person's own choice, not necessarily wrong. But the question is if he's in the wrong. If the wife's actions are not violating any agreed-upon rules, then the husband is choosing to end the marriage, which is his right, but some might say he's overreacting. So depending on the perspective, the answer could be A or B. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, so I need to consider that. The key is whether the wife did something wrong. If not, and the husband is ending the marriage unilaterally, maybe he's in the wrong for not addressing the issue first, like couples counseling or discussing boundaries. However, if he's made a decision that he can't move past it, then it's his choice. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because wanting a divorce is a personal decision based on his feelings, even if others disagree. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, so if the wife didn't do anything wrong, then the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
