We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. The wife admitted to having a crush but clarified it's just physical and she's committed. The husband is hurt and wants to end the relationship.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife was honest, which is a positive. She apologized and tried to address the issue. The husband, on the other hand, is hurt and feels the relationship is over. But is he justified in seeking divorce just because she has a crush? Crushes aren't uncommon, especially if they're not acting on them. The key points here are trust, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nThe wife made an effort to cut the coworker out of her life outside work. That shows she's trying to respect her husband's feelings. However, the husband is still unable to be around her. Maybe he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt. The fact that she mentioned it's similar to men watching porn suggests she doesn't see it as a betrayal, which might be a point of contention. But does that make her wrong? Not necessarily. People have different perspectives on fantasies versus reality.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is important. If the husband can't trust her or feel secure despite her efforts, it's understandable he's considering divorce. But is he in the wrong for that? Or is he just prioritizing his own emotional needs? Divorce is a major decision, but if the relationship is causing him significant hurt and there's no resolution, maybe it's not his fault. However, maybe he should have tried to address the issue more constructively before deciding to end it. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions (having a crush) alone don't necessarily mean she's at fault. The husband's reaction might be an overreaction, but it's also his right to feel hurt. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to leave. If the wife is committed to the relationship and he's not, maybe he's being unfair. But if he's not able to move past this, it's his prerogative. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's reaction is proportionate. The wife admitted the crush exists but isn't acting on it. The husband's decision to leave might be his way of protecting his own emotional well-being, which isn't inherently wrong. But does that make him not in the wrong? Alternatively, maybe he should have tried to work through the issue more thoroughly. \n\nI'm leaning towards the answer being B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on his feelings of hurt and lack of trust, and the wife's actions, while honest, might have crossed a line for him. However, there's a counterargument that he could be overreacting. But in the end, it's his right to want to end the relationship if he can't reconcile the hurt.\n"
