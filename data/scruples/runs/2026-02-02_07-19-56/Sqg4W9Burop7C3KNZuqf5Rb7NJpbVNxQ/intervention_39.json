We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. The situation involves the wife jokingly bringing up an open relationship and mentioning a colleague she finds attractive. The author feels hurt and is considering divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship, which the author found upsetting. The wife has apologized and tried to cut off contact with the coworker. The author is struggling with the emotional impact of this situation.\n\nIn a relationship, trust and communication are key. The wife's openness about her feelings might be seen as honesty, which is positive. However, the author's reaction is about feeling betrayed and unable to continue the relationship. It's important to note that having a crush isn't the same as acting on it. The wife hasn't done anything physically or emotionally intimate with the coworker beyond work interactions.\n\nDivorce is a significant decision, and it's about whether the relationship can be salvaged. The author's reaction could be justified if the trust is irreparably broken. However, the wife is making efforts to address the issue. The author might need to consider counseling or further discussions before deciding on divorce.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's decision to end the relationship is a personal choice. If the wife's actions (even if just emotional) have caused unbearable distress, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking to end the marriage. However, some might argue that the wife's honesty is a positive, but the author's reaction is the main issue here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's making a decision based on his own feelings of hurt and inability to move past this, then perhaps he's not in the wrong. But if the wife's actions are within bounds and the author is overreacting without valid reasons, maybe he is. Since the wife hasn't acted on her feelings and is trying to address the issue, the author's decision might be seen as a personal choice rather than him being at fault. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), but I need to think carefully.\n"
