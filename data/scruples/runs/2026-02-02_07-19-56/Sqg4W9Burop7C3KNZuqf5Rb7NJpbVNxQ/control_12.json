We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a co-worker she finds attractive, even joking about it. The husband got upset, and now he's considering divorce. The wife has apologized and says she's into the husband, not the co-worker, just as a physical specimen. The husband can't get over it, even though she's cutting contact with the co-worker.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and emotional impact. The wife was honest, which is a positive, but the husband feels hurt and betrayed. The question is whether wanting a divorce over this is justified. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner can't move past the other's confession of having a crush, even if it's just a fantasy, it's a valid feeling. Jealousy and insecurity are common, but if it's causing irreparable harm, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting out. However, some might argue that the wife's honesty was appropriate and that the husband's reaction is extreme. \n\nBut the wife did cross a boundary by bringing up the crush and the open relationship. Even if it was joked about, the husband felt it was real. So, the author's reaction might be understandable. On the other hand, if the wife is now making efforts to cut ties, maybe the husband could work through it. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the wife's actions didn't involve any physical or emotional infidelity, just a crush, then the husband's desire to leave might be his personal choice. However, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's entitled to his feelings. Alternatively, if the wife was honest and tried to fix things, the husband might need to consider if his reaction is fair. \n\nThis is tricky. Different people have different thresholds for what they can handle in a relationship. The author's hurt is valid, but if the wife is willing to change, is walking away the only option? It's possible that the author is justified in feeling this way, but whether it's right to end the marriage is subjective. The question is about being in the wrong, not whether ending the marriage is the best choice. \n\nSince the wife was open and tried to address the issue, maybe the author is not in the wrong for being hurt and wanting to leave. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
