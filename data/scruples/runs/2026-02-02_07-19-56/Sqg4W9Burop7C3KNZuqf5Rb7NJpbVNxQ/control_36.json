We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wife confessing she has a crush on a coworker, and the husband wants a divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship jokingly. She mentioned a coworker she's attracted to, comparing him to a fantasy from her teenage years. The husband was hurt and wants to end the relationship. The wife apologized, explained it's just physical, and offered to cut contact with the coworker. The author is conflicted but feels the relationship has fizzled out.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the wife's honesty, the husband's reaction, and the nature of the relationship. \n\nFrom the wife's side, she was honest about her feelings, even if it was in a joking context. She apologized and tried to address the issue by cutting the coworker out of her social circle. Honesty in relationships is often praised, even when the truth is painful. \n\nOn the husband's side, he's hurt and wants to end the relationship. His reaction is emotional, which is understandable given the situation. But does that make him in the wrong? Well, if the wife's actions didn't involve actual cheating or deceit, just expressing a fantasy, then the husband's decision is about his own feelings of betrayal or insecurity. \n\nIn many relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife being honest might be the right approach, but the husband's feelings are valid. The decision to end the marriage is his to make, but whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on whether he had a duty to stay despite her feelings. However, if she's not acting on the crush and is committed to the marriage, then the husband might not be wrong for feeling hurt and choosing to leave. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that wanting a divorce over a crush that's not acted upon is extreme. However, emotions in relationships are subjective. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own emotional well-being if he can't reconcile the hurt. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's dealing with his own hurt feelings and the relationship dynamics. The wife wasn't cheating, just expressing a fantasy. The husband's choice to end it is a personal one, not necessarily wrong.\n"
