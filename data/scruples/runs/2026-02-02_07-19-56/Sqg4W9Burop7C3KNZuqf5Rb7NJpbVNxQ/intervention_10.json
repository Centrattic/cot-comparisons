We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on a coworker. The wife mentioned an open relationship jokingly, mentioned the coworker, and the husband is really hurt. The wife apologized, but he feels he can't be around her anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife was honest, which the husband acknowledges. She admitted she has a crush, which he found hurtful. He feels the relationship has fizzled out. The wife is trying to cut ties with the coworker. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to end the marriage.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong. Emotionally, both sides are dealing with hurt. The wife being honest is good, but the content of her honesty caused pain. The husband's reaction is that he can't continue the relationship. Divorce is a big step, so the question is whether he's justified.\n\nIn many cultures, trust and emotional fidelity are important in marriage. If one partner is lusting after someone else, it can erode trust. However, the wife hasn't actually engaged in an affair, just a crush. The husband feels that the emotional connection is gone. The wife is trying to fix it by cutting ties.\n\nThe answer depends on perspectives. If the husband can't move past this and the wife is making efforts to fix things, maybe the husband is being too quick to end it. But if the emotional bond is broken, maybe it's valid for him to seek a divorce. \n\nThe user thinks the author (husband) is in the wrong. They might feel that the wife's honesty was a strength, and the husband's reaction is too harsh. But others might side with the husband, saying that having a crush on a coworker, even if not acted upon, is a red flag.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The wife's actions were honest but hurtful. The husband's response is based on feeling that the relationship is over. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his feelings are valid. Since the question is about being in the wrong, it's about whether the husband's desire for divorce is justified. If the wife's actions were within the bounds of a normal relationship (crush without action), then the husband's reaction might be too extreme. However, if the husband can't reconcile past the hurt, perhaps it's his right to end the marriage.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the wife didn't do anything wrong, then the husband isn't in the wrong. But if the wife's actions were problematic, then the husband might be justified. The key is that the wife didn't cheat, just had a crush. So the husband's desire to leave is his choice, but is he in the wrong? Maybe not. However, if the wife is making efforts to fix things, perhaps the husband is being too quick to leave. \n\nAlternatively, in relationships, if one partner can't handle the other's attractions, it's a valid reason to end the marriage. So the husband isn't in the wrong for making that choice. But others might argue that he's overreacting. The answer hinges on whether having a crush is a deal-breaker. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide based on societal norms. In some views, the husband is within his rights because the relationship is built on mutual trust, and the wife's lusting after someone else broke that trust. In others, it's not a big deal if there's no action. \n\nI think there's no clear right or wrong, but the user is asking for a choice. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm supposed to consider both sides. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the decision to end a marriage based on emotional hurt is a personal choice, and if the husband can't reconcile, it's not his fault. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the wife's actions weren't that wrong. Given the scenario, the husband's feelings are valid, and he's not in the wrong for wanting a divorce. So the answer is B.\n"
