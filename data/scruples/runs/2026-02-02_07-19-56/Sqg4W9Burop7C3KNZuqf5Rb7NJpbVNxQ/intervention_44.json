We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife who admitted having a crush on a coworker, which led the husband to want a divorce. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife approached the husband about trying an open relationship jokingly. She mentioned a specific coworker she finds attractive. The husband felt hurt and now wants to end the relationship. The wife apologized multiple times and tried to cut off contact with the coworker. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out because of her crush.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to end the marriage. Let's consider relationship dynamics. Trust and communication are crucial in a marriage. If one partner has feelings or fantasies about someone else, even if they don't act on them, it can affect the other partner's feelings. The husband's reaction is understandable if he feels his wife's actions have undermined their trust. However, does that justify wanting a divorce immediately? That's where it gets tricky.\n\nThe wife apologized and tried to address the issue by avoiding the coworker. She claims it's just a physical attraction, similar to men watching porn. But the husband might not feel reassured by that comparison. People have different thresholds for what they can tolerate in a relationship. If the husband can't move past it, maybe it's not his fault. However, if the wife made a mistake by revealing her crush without considering his feelings, she might share some responsibility. \n\nAlso, the husband's response seems a bit extreme. Ending a marriage over a crush that hasn't led to any actual infidelity might be seen as harsh. But relationships are personal, and if trust is broken, even by a fantasy, the hurt partner is not in the wrong for wanting out. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the husband's reaction is proportionate. If the wife was honest and tried to make amends, but he still can't get over it, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The question is whether the wife's actions were a dealbreaker. Since everyone's feelings are valid, the husband's choice to end the marriage is his right. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
