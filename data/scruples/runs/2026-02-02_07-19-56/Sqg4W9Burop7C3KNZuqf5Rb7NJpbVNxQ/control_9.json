We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. The user is asking for an A or B answer, where A means the author is in the wrong and B means not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, which they joked about. Then she mentioned a specific coworker, a \"perfect physical specimen,\" and that she wants him to \"wreck her.\" The husband got really upset, felt hurt, and now wants to consider divorce. The wife has apologized multiple times, is honest, and even agreed to cut off contact with the coworker outside work. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out because of this, even though she says she's into him just physically and it's like guys watching porn.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a relationship, trust and comfort are crucial. If the wife is openly admitting to a crush and even considering an open relationship, that might be a deal-breaker for some. But is the husband justified in wanting a divorce? On one hand, he's hurt and feels the relationship is over. On the other, the wife was honest and tried to make changes. Open relationships are a choice, and if the husband is uncomfortable with the idea, he's not obligated to stay. However, wanting a divorce over a crush that wasn't acted upon might be seen as overreacting. But from the husband's perspective, the emotional hurt is real. \n\nIs there a cultural or personal context that matters here? The wife's friends and coworkers don't care about her crush, which might imply that in their social circle, such things are more accepted. The husband's reaction is based on feeling betrayed, even if the wife hasn't done anything beyond having a crush. The fact that they discussed it and she apologized suggests she's remorseful and willing to change. The author's decision to want to end the marriage could be a personal choice based on his emotional response, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nAlso, the wife says he's her fantasy and she's with the author for real. That might indicate she sees the coworker as an ideal, not someone she wants to replace the husband with. However, the husband might not be able to move past the fact that she even has such a fantasy. It's about whether the wife's actions (admitting a crush) are a valid reason for divorce. \n\nIn some views, wanting a divorce because of a non-action (like a crush) without infidelity or active pursuit could be seen as the husband's choice, not necessarily the wife's fault. The author is hurt, but if the wife is not acting on it, maybe the author is overreacting. However, if the husband can't reconcile this and the marriage is no longer working for him, then his decision to end it is his right. \n\nSo, the key points: the wife was honest, the crush hasn't led to any action, she's making efforts to avoid contact. The husband is hurt and feels the relationship is over. The author wants a divorce because of the crush. The question is if that makes him in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer here would be B, no, the author isn't in the wrong. It's his personal feeling and decision. Even though the wife didn't act on it and apologized, the emotional impact is real. However, some might argue that he's overreacting, but the user's question is about whether he's in the wrong. In terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But since the wife admitted it and the husband can't handle it, he's not obligated to stay. So the answer is B.\n"
