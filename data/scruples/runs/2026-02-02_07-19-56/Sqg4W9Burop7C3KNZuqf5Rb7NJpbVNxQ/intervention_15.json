We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship, mentioned a specific coworker she's into, and got flustered when he hits on her. The husband is hurt and wants to end the relationship. The wife apologized multiple times and tried to cut off contact with the coworker. The husband feels the relationship has fizzled out because of this.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. In a marriage, trust and comfort are important. If one partner is lusting after someone else, even if it's just a fantasy, it can definitely hurt the other. The wife's honesty is commendable, but maybe she didn't realize how her actions affected her husband. \n\nOn the other hand, wanting a divorce over a crush might be a strong reaction. Is it reasonable for the husband to want to end the marriage just because his wife admires someone else physically, especially if she's not acting on it and has apologized? Maybe the husband is overreacting. But if he can't get over the betrayal feeling, even if it's not an affair, it's his right to seek a divorce if he's unhappy. \n\nI should also consider cultural norms. Some might see the wife's behavior as not a big deal, just a fantasy, while others see it as a breach of trust. The husband's emotional response is valid. The key is whether the wife's actions cross a line that the husband can't accept. If the wife isn't cheating and is trying to distance herself from the coworker, maybe the husband's reaction is too harsh. But if the husband can't move past the hurt, he's not wrong for wanting out. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If someone is genuinely hurt by their spouse's infatuation, even without cheating, it's their choice to leave. So maybe answer B. But some might argue that wanting to leave over a crush is too extreme, making the author wrong. I need to decide based on typical perspectives. In many cases, people might say the husband is justified if he can't trust her anymore. So perhaps B.\n"
