We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife asked about an open relationship and mentioned a coworker she finds attractive. She even joked about wanting him to \"wreck her.\" The husband was upset because it wasn't just a joke and she had a specific person in mind. The wife apologized and explained it's similar to guys watching porn, but the husband is hurt and considering divorce. She's willing to cut ties with the coworker.\n\nSo, the key points here are the wife's honesty and the husband's reaction. The wife was open about her feelings, which is good. But the husband is hurt and doesn't want to be around her anymore. The wife is making efforts to address the issue by cutting off contact with the coworker. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about right or wrong. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The wife was honest, which is a positive step. However, the husband's feelings of hurt and wanting to end the relationship is also valid. People have different thresholds for what they can tolerate in a relationship. The fact that the wife admitted her feelings and tried to fix the problem by avoiding the coworker is in her favor. \n\nBut the husband is choosing to end the marriage because of her past feelings. Is that fair? Well, if the wife isn't acting on those feelings and is making an effort to avoid the situation, maybe the husband is overreacting. However, if the husband feels that the trust is broken or he can't move past it, then it's his right to seek a divorce. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a divorce if he's genuinely hurt and the situation is affecting his ability to be in a healthy relationship. The wife's actions were honest, but the husband's feelings are valid. So, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). \n\nBut I need to consider if there's something else. The wife admitted to having a crush and even joked about it in a way that might have been inappropriate. The husband's reaction is based on trust issues. But the wife is making an effort to fix it. If the husband can't trust her after her efforts, then maybe it's a matter of the husband's own inability to move past it, which isn't her fault. \n\nHmm. So, the author's desire for divorce is a personal choice, but isn't inherently wrong because everyone has different deal-breakers. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
