We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. The situation seems a bit complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the wife brought up the idea of an open relationship in a joking manner. She mentioned a specific coworker, someone she's been flirting with or at least has a crush on. The husband is upset because even though she apologized, he's hurt and wants to end the relationship. The wife claims she's into the coworker only physically and that the husband is her real partner. She's willing to cut off contact with the coworker outside work.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author (husband) is in the wrong. The question is whether I agree. The options are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the wife was honest, which is a positive. She might not have intended to hurt him, but she had feelings for someone else, which is a big deal in a relationship. On the other hand, the husband is feeling betrayed and can't reconcile, which is valid. In relationships, trust and emotional connection are crucial. If one partner is fantasizing about another person, even if it's just physical, it can erode that trust. The wife's actions might not be as severe as cheating, but they can still cause significant emotional distress. The decision to end the marriage is the husband's choice, but it's not necessarily \"wrong\" because he has the right to his feelings. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on context. If the wife hasn't done anything physically wrong and is making efforts to change, maybe the husband is overreacting. But if the emotional attachment is causing him to feel this way, it's understandable. It's hard to say. I think both parties have valid points, but since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the wife was honest and willing to adjust, maybe the husband is being unfair. But in terms of his right to end the marriage, it's his choice. The answer might hinge on whether the wife's actions cross the line. Since she hasn't actually cheated and is open about her feelings, maybe the husband is wrong to end it. But if he can't overcome the hurt, then he's not in the wrong for choosing to leave. Hmm. The user's answer is A (he's wrong), which suggests that the wife's honesty and lack of infidelity justify his decision not to be in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn. In many cases, wanting a divorce because of someone else's attraction can be seen as valid if it's causing emotional harm. However, if there's no infidelity, maybe the husband is overreacting. I think the answer is A or B depending on perspective. But the user is asking for an opinion. Given that the wife is honest and hasn't done anything physical, the husband's reaction might be excessive. So leaning towards A. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is A.\n"
