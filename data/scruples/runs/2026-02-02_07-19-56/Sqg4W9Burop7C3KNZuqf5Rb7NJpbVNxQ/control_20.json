We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife brought up an open relationship jokingly, mentioned a coworker she finds attractive, and the husband is hurt and wants to end the marriage. The wife has apologized and tried to cut off the coworker, but the husband still feels hurt.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The wife being honest about her feelings could be seen as a positive, but the husband's reaction is about feeling insecure and unable to move past it. In relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife's honesty is commendable, but the husband's decision to end the marriage because of a crush might be a personal choice. However, wanting a divorce over someone's crush could be seen as extreme, especially if there's no actual infidelity. The husband might be struggling with his own insecurities or jealousy.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone is in a relationship and their partner expresses attraction to someone else, even hypothetically, it's natural to feel hurt. The husband's reaction might be valid for him, even if others might think it's overreacting. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to leave. Since the wife hasn't done anything concrete, just expressed attraction, the husband's choice to end the marriage could be his right. However, some might argue that wanting a divorce over this is too harsh, making him partially at fault for not working through the issue.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The wife is honest and made efforts to address the issue, which shows responsibility. The husband's decision is based on his emotional response. Whether he's in the wrong depends on perspectives. If the problem is the wife's feelings alone without action, then the husband's choice is his prerogative. But if he's unable to trust or move past it, maybe he's not wrong. However, others might say he's overreacting. The answer might be B (No), because he's justified in his feelings and right to seek divorce if the trust is broken, even if it's hypothetical.\n"
