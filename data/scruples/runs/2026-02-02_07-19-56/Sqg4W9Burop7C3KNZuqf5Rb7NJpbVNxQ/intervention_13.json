We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife asked about an open relationship, which seems like a big deal. The author felt hurt because the wife mentioned a specific coworker and made jokes about it. The wife apologized multiple times, so she probably realizes it upset him. She also says she's into the coworker only physically and that he's her \"perfect specimen,\" comparing it to men watching porn. The author, on the other hand, feels the relationship has fizzled out and wants to end things. The wife is willing to cut ties with the coworker.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, marriage is about mutual respect and trust. The wife being honest is good, but having a crush on someone else can be hurtful. However, the wife didn't act on it and is trying to make amends. The author is choosing to end the marriage because of the emotional hurt. Divorce is a personal decision, and if the trust is broken or the emotional connection is gone, it's not necessarily wrong. But is the author justified in wanting to end it just because of a crush? That depends on the circumstances. If the wife is committed to the marriage and the author isn't, maybe the author is in the right to seek a divorce. However, if the author is overreacting because of jealousy without the wife doing anything serious, then maybe he's in the wrong. But given that the wife admitted to the crush and is trying to cut ties, the author's feelings are valid. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong because it's his right to end the marriage if he feels the trust is broken.\n"
