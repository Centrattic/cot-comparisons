We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants a divorce because their wife admitted to having a crush on a coworker is in the wrong. The wife was honest and even apologized, but the husband feels hurt and wants to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife brought up the idea of an open relationship jokingly but then mentioned a specific coworker. The husband felt betrayed and hurt by her admission, even if she's saying he's the real partner. The wife claims it's just physical attraction, like how men watch porn, but the husband can't handle that.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship. The wife was honest, which is good, but maybe she didn't realize how her words would affect him. The husband's reaction is about feeling inadequate and unable to move past her admission. It's his right to feel that way, but does that mean he's in the wrong for wanting to leave?\n\nIn relationships, everyone has different boundaries. If the wife's actions (like getting flustered around the coworker) cross his boundaries, then his decision to seek divorce isn't necessarily wrong. However, the wife tried to address the issue by cutting off contact with the coworker. The husband might not feel that's enough if he's already hurt and the trust is broken.\n\nBut is wanting to end the marriage over someone else's crush, even if it's not acted upon, valid? Some might say the husband is overreacting, but others might say it's about personal feelings and the inability to reconcile the hurt. The question is whether he's at fault for prioritizing his own feelings in this situation. Since the wife was honest and willing to adjust her behavior, maybe the husband's decision is his prerogative. However, if the wife's actions didn't harm the relationship beyond the emotional impact, the husband might be the one making a choice based on his emotional response, not necessarily a wrong one.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be no, the author isn't in the wrong. It's his right to decide he can't be in the relationship anymore after feeling that level of hurt, even if the wife didn't act on her feelings.\n"
