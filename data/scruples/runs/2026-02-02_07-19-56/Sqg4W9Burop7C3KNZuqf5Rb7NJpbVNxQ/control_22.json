We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife told her husband she has a crush on a coworker, which he found hurtful and wants a divorce. The user is asking if he's the asshole for wanting to leave because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether having a crush on someone is grounds for divorce. Crushes aren't uncommon, but how they're handled matters. The wife admitted she has a crush, and the husband feels hurt. The wife apologized multiple times and said she sees the coworker as a physical specimen, not a real emotional connection. She also said she's with the husband. \n\nThe husband says he can't be around her anymore because the relationship has fizzled. The wife is trying to cut off contact with the coworker. So, is the husband right to want a divorce? Well, in a relationship, trust and comfort are important. If one partner's actions or feelings make the other uncomfortable to the point of wanting to end the marriage, that's a big deal. The wife might not have done anything physically wrong, but the emotional impact is significant. \n\nHowever, maybe the husband is overreacting. Crushes happen, and if the wife is committed to the marriage, maybe this is a solvable issue. But if the husband can't get over it, maybe his reaction is justified. It's also about mutual respect. The wife was honest, which is good, but the husband's feelings are valid too. \n\nI think it's a tricky situation. The wife's honesty is a positive, but the husband's hurt is real. If the wife is willing to cut ties with the coworker and the husband still feels he can't continue the relationship, maybe it's not his fault. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But some might argue he's too sensitive. But given the information, the husband's feelings are legitimate, and the wife's actions (even if not cheating) caused enough distress to consider divorce. So probably B.\n"
