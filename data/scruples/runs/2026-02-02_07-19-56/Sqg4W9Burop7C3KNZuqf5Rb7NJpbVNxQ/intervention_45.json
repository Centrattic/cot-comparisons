We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because their wife has a crush on a coworker. The situation starts with the wife asking the author if he's open to an open relationship. They joked about it, and she mentioned a coworker who reminds her of a fantasy. The author got really angry, and now he's considering divorce. The wife has apologized and tried to cut off contact with the coworker, but the author feels hurt and things have changed between them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife was honest, which is a positive thing, but the author is struggling with the emotional impact. The key points here are consent to an open relationship versus having a crush. The wife proposed an open relationship, which implies some level of non-exclusivity, but the author wasn't into it. However, she later admitted she had a crush, which might cross into territory the author didn't agree to.\n\nIn many relationships, especially monogamous ones, discussing or even having a crush on someone else can be a big deal. The wife's actions, even if she later apologized and tried to fix things, might have breached the author's trust. The author's reaction is understandable; feeling hurt and considering divorce isn't uncommon in such cases. The wife's comparison to guys watching porn could be a way to downplay her feelings, but that might not validate the author's hurt. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife was upfront about her feelings, which is good. She's made efforts to address the issue by cutting contact with the coworker. But the author is still unable to reconcile, which could be due to past trust issues or personal boundaries. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to end the marriage. If the wife's actions violated the terms the author set for the relationship (like expecting monogamy), then he's justified. However, if he agreed to an open relationship at some point and is now changing his stance, that's a different scenario. Here, it seems the author didn't agree to an open relationship, so the wife's admission of a crush is a deal-breaker for him. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe the wife's honesty is a virtue and the author shouldn't be so triggered? However, relationships are about mutual boundaries. If the wife's actions crossed those, the author's feelings are valid. So my analysis is that the author isn't in the wrong because the wife's actions went against his expectations and trust, leading to the breakdown. The answer should be B, No.\n"
