We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife admitted to having a crush on a coworker. She mentioned it jokingly, but the author is really hurt and wants a divorce. The wife has apologized multiple times and is trying to cut off the coworker. The author feels that the relationship has fizzled out and can't be around her anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife was honest, which is a positive point for her. She even tried to make amends by cutting off the coworker. But the author is struggling with the fact that she lusted after someone else, even if it was just a fantasy. \n\nIn relationships, trust and emotional security are crucial. The wife's actions, even if they were in a joking manner, might have crossed a line for the author. The comparison to guys watching porn is interesting. Some people might see it as a normal fantasy, but others might find it offensive or a breach of trust. \n\nThe key here is that the author feels hurt and can't reconcile that. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to leave. Well, if the wife was honest and tried to fix the situation, maybe the author is justified in his feelings. However, some might argue that having a crush isn't cheating, and the author overreacting. \n\nBut the author's feelings are valid. He's the one who's hurt and can't move past it. The decision to end the marriage is a personal one. Since the wife didn't act on the crush and took steps to address it, maybe the author is not entirely at fault. On the other hand, if he can't get over it despite her efforts, it's still his prerogative. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, emotions in relationships can be complex. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he feels this strongly. The wife did the right thing by being open, but the author's reaction is about his own inability to handle the situation. So, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
