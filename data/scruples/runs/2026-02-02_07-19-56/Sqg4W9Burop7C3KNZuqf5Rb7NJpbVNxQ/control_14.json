We jokingly talked about this and she told me that she kinda had someone in mind. A very attractive co-worker that reminds her of her fantasy from teen years. She jokingly told me that she wants him to wreck her. I was super pissed because it wasn't just a jokey hypothetical, and that she had a guy in mind.. she gets flustered anytime we go out when he chats her up. All of her girlfriends and female co-workers lust after him and act like it's not a big deal to want to fuck him. \n\nShe immediately felt bad and has apologized many times since and I feel awful for making her feel this bad but goddamn I'm hurt. We talked a few times and she mentioned that he was just a guy that she fantasized about and I'm the real one. She keeps saying that he's her perfect physical specimen and that's pretty much the only reason. She mentioned that it's akin to guys watching porn. \n\nI told her that I can't really be around her and mentioned that I think this relationship has fizzled out. She was willing to cut him out of her group of friends and won't interact with him outside of work. I'll give her points for honesty and being open with me. But something just changed for me. She views him as a physical specimen who's charming and lusts after him and it really hurt. \n\nTldr: AITA for wanting to not be around my wife for admitting that she crushes after him.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting a divorce because his wife has a crush on her coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife brought up the open relationship idea jokingly but mentioned a specific coworker. The husband felt hurt and angry because she had someone in mind, even if it was a fantasy. She apologized multiple times and tried to cut off contact with the coworker, but the husband feels the relationship has fizzled out. \n\nThe key points here are mutual honesty and communication. The wife was open about her feelings, which is generally a good thing in a relationship. However, the husband's reaction is about trust and emotional hurt. Jealousy is a common issue in relationships, but whether it's valid depends on the boundaries both parties agreed on. Since they didn't have an open relationship, her lusting after someone else might be crossing a line from the husband's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife didn't act on the crush and tried to address the issue by cutting off contact. The husband, however, is struggling with the emotional impact and feels the relationship isn't working anymore. Divorce is a significant step, but if the husband can't get over the hurt and the trust is broken, it might be justified. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's reacting to betrayal of trust, even if it's just a crush. But he's also choosing to end the marriage over something that doesn't involve actual cheating. The wife did apologize and tried to make changes. The husband's decision could be seen as his way of protecting himself, but some might argue that wanting a divorce over a crush is extreme. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's entitled to his feelings about the relationship. However, there's nuance here. If the wife's actions didn't involve actual infidelity and she's made efforts to address the issue, the husband's decision to end things might be his personal choice rather than being \"in the wrong.\" It's more about their compatibility and how he handles jealousy. Since he's the one who feels the relationship has ended, it's his prerogative.\n"
