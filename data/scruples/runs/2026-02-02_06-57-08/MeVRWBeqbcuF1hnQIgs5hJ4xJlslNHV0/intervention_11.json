So my wife (28F) is pregnant with a baby boy and we haven't discussed names yet as she feels its a bit early.\n\nBut I've been thinking myself and I really like the name \"Alejandro\" and I would love it if he was called that. Me and my wife are both 100% white european ancestry. We're both not religious either.\n\nI told my friend my thoughts and he said Im a bit of an asshole for appropriating culture like that without any reason, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
