To compensate, she does the cooking and cleaning. Which has worked out fine for the last two years.\n\nLately, she's been getting irritable about some of the chores. AITA for thinking she needs to do more of the housework since I pay more of the rent/utilities?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
