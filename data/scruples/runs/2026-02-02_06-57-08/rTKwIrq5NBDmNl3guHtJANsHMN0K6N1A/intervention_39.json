April Fools! We\u2019re not. Specifically I posted \u201c[Birth Announcement] 2: Electric Boogaloo, Due Fall 2019\u201d. Of course there were some people who took it at face value and liked it and congratulationed us, some were quick to comment with April Fool\u2019s skepticism, others congratulationed us with the caveat \u201cif it\u2019s real\u201d to make sure we knew we didn\u2019t totally fool them in the event it was a joke. Here\u2019s the troublesome part: some folks decided to call me out for extreme insensitivity toward people who have suffered through infertility/miscarriage/stillbirth saying that I shouldn\u2019t joke about things that have brought people so much pain. None of the people leveling these accusations have personally struggled through those circumstances yet friends of mine who have were fine with the joke. I said I\u2019m willing to give any necessary apologies to people who were directly hurt but told the complainers to stop being offended on behalf of hypothetical people and have, so far, refused to admit any wrongdoing or apologize to anyone. \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
