Also, she is not pregnant.\n\nAnyway, me and my GF were sitting talking about shit and the topic of pregnancy comes up. She doesn't really *want* to have kids anytime soon, but she said that she wouldn't abort/give away a kid if she had one. I made a joke about her \"not giving the baby away on her own then\", and she got pretty upset. After some pushing I got annoyed and told her flat out that if she ever gets pregnant, birth control or not, I'm leaving her.\n\nI love her, but I can't stand children, never have, probably never will, and I would never let a kid ruin my life, or at least fuck me financially. She's really upset, saying that I'm not loyal and that I have a shitty view on women and responsibilities, but I just told her the truth. The moment she says she's pregnant, I would be out of there. \n\nSad but true. But am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?
