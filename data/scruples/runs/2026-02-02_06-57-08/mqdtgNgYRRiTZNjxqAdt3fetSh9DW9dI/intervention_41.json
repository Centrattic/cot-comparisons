  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I did a 23andMe test when my parents don't want me to?\nWhen I was around 13 (seven years ago) my parents told me that there was some uncertainty regarding my paternity. My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. \n\nSo my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said \"yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically\"\n\nMy mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
