So instead of severely punishing the students who kept getting caught they just shut down that restroom permanently for the rest of the school year. Now this really pissed me off because 1 they're not really fixing the problem and 2 I'm nearby this bathroom for the majority of the day. So now I have to walk to the other side of school just to go to the bathroom.\nLast week when I went to the bathroom on the other side of the school I saw a whole group of idiots in there vaping (to make it clear I don't really have a problem with vaping, it's that they're doing at the school to please their peers). I didn't really say anything to them I just did my business and walked out. When I walked into the hallway I saw my schools resource officer. When I saw him I thought about and said screw and told what was currently happening in the bathroom and went in and busted a whole bunch of kids. I didn't really think anything of it cause I figured \"screw those guys\". Later I found out that one of the kids had been caught so many times they took serious action and expelled him. The reason I feel bad is because they were all freshmen(so like 14-15 year olds) who haven't fully realized how the world works.
