I'm 186 cm (6'1\") tall so when I do that, there isn't much room next to me. If someone asks that I move my bag, I obviously oblige.  \n  \nThe reason for doing this is that often the mentally challenged person is loud, has bad personal hygiene or is just generally unpleasant to sit next to. Often they are also quite obese and take up a lot of space. They also may ignore when I need to exit the bus, as I often am the only one who exits at my stop.  \n  \nThe reason I'm writing here is that someone sort of called me out on it today, as they loudly remarked to a mentally challenged person that \"they could sit next to them, and people shouldn't have their bags on the empty seats. \"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
