I don\u2019t ask him to do anything particularly gross or meticulous and even set up his coffee pot for when he wakes up. \nIt\u2019s not a lot and should take less than an hour to accomplish. \nHe can\u2019t/won\u2019t do it and gets snippy when I don\u2019t hit my knees to praise him for only doing 3/4s. \nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
