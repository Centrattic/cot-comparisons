We have no problems with others eating meat in general but we often find the smell or look of it to be kind of gross. We never say anything about other people eating meat around us but on our wedding day we'd rather just not have to deal with it. AITA if the reception has no meat options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
