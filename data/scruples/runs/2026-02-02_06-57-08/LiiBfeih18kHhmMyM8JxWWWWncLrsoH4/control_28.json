Last night's game was a big back and forth and when the eagle's tied it up late, she jumped on me on the couch and went for a flurry of kisses. My response was \"Yo get off me\" and I gave her a stern yet gentle stiff arm.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of no talking she calls me an asshole and then got even angrier when I was happy Dallas won.\n\nI tried to explain to her how she gets emotional during Grey's Anatomy is comparable to how I get angry/excited while watching sports, but she  still insisted I'm an ass for it. Am I?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",
