She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an almanac, which is a notebook containing personal notes about his wife. The situation is that his wife found out about it and is upset, feeling that it cheapens his gestures and feels betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's intention was good: he wanted to remember important details about his wife to show his love and avoid being someone who forgets things. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. On the other hand, his wife is hurt because she thought he remembered things organically, and the existence of the almanac made her feel like he's using a \"playbook,\" which could imply insincerity or manipulation.\n\nI need to think about what's wrong here. Was the act of keeping a personal journal wrong? If the husband's actions were meant to be thoughtful and the wife is upset for a different reason, maybe the issue isn't with the almanac itself but with the wife's reaction. But maybe the husband should have considered that keeping a list might make gestures feel less genuine to his wife. Alternatively, maybe the wife is overreacting.\n\nAnother angle: trust and transparency. The husband didn't hide the almanac, but he kept it private. When the wife found it, she felt betrayed. Is the act of keeping a personal record a breach of trust? Or is the issue that the wife didn't like the implications of the almanac (like it being a set of strategies rather than heartfelt actions)? The husband's intention is to love her, but the wife's feelings are hurt. \n\nIn relationships, intentions vs. perceptions matter. Even if the husband's intention was good, if his wife perceives the almanac as manipulative, then the husband might need to address her feelings. But is he in the wrong? Or is it a misunderstanding that needs communication?\n\nThe key points here are: the husband's actions were meant to be loving, he kept it private and never shared it, the wife is now upset because she feels the gestures are less genuine. The husband isn't doing anything malicious, but his wife is hurt. So, maybe the almanac itself isn't wrong, but the husband should consider her feelings and maybe explain his reasoning better. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the answer often depends on whether the person's actions were reasonable and whether they caused harm. The husband didn't intend harm, but the wife is hurt. If the wife's reaction is about feeling that the love is insincere, that's a valid feeling even if the husband's intention was good. However, the husband isn't doing anything that's inherently wrong. Maybe the wife's reaction is an overreaction, and the husband isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the husband should have considered that keeping a list might affect how his gestures are perceived.\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because his actions were well-intentioned and he kept the almanac private. The wife's reaction is about her feelings of being manipulated, which might be a misunderstanding. The husband needs to communicate his intentions and reassure her, but he isn't the one at fault here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
