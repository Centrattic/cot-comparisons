She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author started writing down things his wife mentioned, like her favorite things, to remember them and do nice things for her. He kept it private, and now she's upset, thinking it's a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. He feels this is a sign of his love, not trying to manipulate or anything.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and perspective. The author's intention was to remember things to be thoughtful. He didn't share it with anyone, which shows he meant it for her. But she took it as manipulative, like he's using a script for sweet gestures. That's a big difference in how they perceive the same action.\n\nWhy would she feel that way? Maybe she thinks he's not being genuine, that he's planning these things rather than spontaneously caring. It might make her feel like she's an object with a list of preferences, rather than a person he's connecting with naturally. Also, the term \"playbook\" implies a strategy, which she might see as inauthentic.\n\nBut the author's defense is that he just wanted to remember things so he wouldn't forget. He's trying to avoid being the forgetful husband. The fact that he kept it private and only used it to do nice things suggests no malicious intent.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, maybe not in intent. He didn't mean to hurt her. However, the action of keeping a detailed list, even with good intentions, might have made her feel uneasy. It's possible that transparency could have helped. If he had mentioned it before, maybe she wouldn't have reacted this way. But he thought it was a sweet gesture, and she's interpreting it as insincere.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if something is done with good intentions, if it makes the partner feel uncomfortable, it's a problem. The author didn't consider that keeping such a list might not sit well with her. So maybe he's not in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action did cause harm, so he's responsible for addressing it.\n\nThe question is whether he's \"in the wrong.\" If \"wrong\" means he acted unethically or maliciously, then B (No). But if it's about causing harm unintentionally, it's a gray area. Since the question is likely following the \"Am I the Asshole?\" format, where the answer depends on intent and whether the action was genuinely harmful without malice.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author had good intentions and was trying to be loving. However, he needs to address her feelings and maybe adjust how he shows his care. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about perspective. Since the action wasn't malicious, he's not the asshole.\n"
