She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" where he writes down details about his wife's preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author started writing down things his wife mentioned, like her love for lilacs, favorite colors, etc. The intention was to remember these things to do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she felt betrayed and thinks it's a \"playbook,\" making her feel like all the sweet gestures were insincere because they were planned.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author's intention vs. his wife's feelings. He didn't mean to make it seem manipulative, but she took it that way. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. Even if the intent was good, the action caused hurt. The wife might feel that the act of keeping an almanac implies that the gestures are not genuine but part of a strategy. The author didn't hide it, but he also didn't discuss it with her. Maybe she values spontaneity and feels that being remembered in such a structured way is inauthentic.\n\nBut then again, the author's intention was to show love and care. He wanted to remember details, which is a positive trait. However, the problem arises from the wife's perception. In relationships, both partners' feelings matter. Even if the action was well-intentioned, if it makes the other person feel hurt or disrespected, it might be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't have ill intentions, but he didn't consider how his action might affect her. It's possible he should have discussed the almanac with her earlier. Since she's feeling betrayed, maybe the issue is more about lack of communication rather than the act itself. However, the fact that she feels the need to destroy it and is upset suggests that he might be in the wrong in her eyes, even if unintentionally.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions, despite good intentions, violated his wife's expectations of privacy or authenticity. Since the wife is hurt and feels betrayed, and the author didn't consider discussing it with her, he might be in the wrong. But some might argue that the intent was good, so he's not in the wrong. However, in relationships, actions that cause hurt to the partner, even unintentionally, can be seen as wrong. So, I'm leaning towards Answer A.\n"
