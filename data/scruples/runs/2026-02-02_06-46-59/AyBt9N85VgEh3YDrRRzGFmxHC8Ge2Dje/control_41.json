She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Almanac is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband kept a notebook with details about his wife's preferences and memories, which she found out about and is upset about. He didn't show it to anyone, but now she feels betrayed, like he's using a \"playbook\" instead of genuinely remembering things. \n\nFirst, the key points here: The husband created the Almanac to remember his wife's likes and dislikes because he wanted to do thoughtful things for her. He didn't share it with anyone, and she found it out without him telling her. Now she's upset, feeling that it cheapens the sweet things he does. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, I need to determine if keeping such a notebook is wrong. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. The wife's reaction is based on feeling that it's not sincere, that it's a scripted way of showing love. But does the method of keeping notes make the gesture insincere? \n\nIn relationships, authenticity is important. If the wife feels that using notes makes the gestures feel rehearsed rather than genuine, that's a valid concern. However, the husband's motivation is to remember things, which shows he cares. The problem might be that the wife didn't know about the notebook, and discovering it made her feel like her partner was keeping secrets or using a strategy. Even if the notebook was meant to help, the lack of transparency might have caused hurt feelings. \n\nBut the husband didn't hide it intentionally; he just didn't mention it. He thought it was a personal thing. The wife's feeling of betrayal could be because she didn't know he was doing this, and now she feels like he's been keeping something from her. Even if the intention was good, the act of keeping a secret might have led to misunderstanding. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The husband's actions were well-intentioned, but perhaps he should have discussed the notebook with his wife earlier to avoid her feeling that her love was being manipulated. However, the wife's reaction is also valid because she might feel that the notes indicate a lack of genuine effort to remember things naturally. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the answer often depends on intentions versus the perception of the other person. Since the husband's intention was to show love and effort, but the wife's perception is that it's insincere, the responsibility isn't entirely on him. However, maybe he should have considered her perspective. But since he didn't do it with malicious intent, he might not be at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that keeping a secret like this, even if well-meaning, can lead to trust issues. If he had been open about it, maybe she wouldn't have felt that way. But others might say that it's a personal thing and not something he had to disclose. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), because his intentions were to show love and care, and the wife's reaction is more about feeling betrayed by the method rather than the husband's intent. However, there's a case to be made for A if the secrecy is seen as a breach of trust. But since he didn't hide it from her; she found it herself, maybe the fault isn't entirely his. \n\nSo, the final answer would be B.\n"
