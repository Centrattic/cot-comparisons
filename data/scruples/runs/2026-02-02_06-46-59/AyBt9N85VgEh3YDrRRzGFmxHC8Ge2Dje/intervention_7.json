She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband keeping an Almanac with notes about his wife's preferences and memories.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The husband created this notebook to remember details about his wife because he wants to do sweet things for her. He never showed anyone, kept it a secret. Then his wife found it, and she's upset, feeling betrayed. She calls it a \"playbook\" and the sweet gestures are now cheapened in her eyes. The husband is confused because he thought it was a sign of love and commitment.\n\nSo the question is, was he in the wrong? The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. The possible answers are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband's intention was good. He wanted to remember important things about his wife, which shows he cares. He kept it private, not to deceive but to organize. But on the other hand, his wife felt betrayed. The key here is communication. Even if the intention was good, if the wife didn't know about it and now feels like the gestures were insincere or planned, that's a problem.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. If he kept it a secret, even if it was for a good reason, it might have made his wife feel that he wasn't being genuine. The fact that she felt the sweet actions were cheapened suggests that she values spontaneity and sincerity. Having a written list might make her feel like the gestures were premeditated and not heartfelt, which could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is significant. She's not just upset; she's considering destroying the notebook. That's a strong reaction. The husband might not have realized that keeping such a detailed record could be perceived as manipulative or insincere, even if it was intended to be thoughtful.\n\nHowever, the husband's intention was to remember and show love. He didn't share it with others, so there's no deceit. But maybe the issue is that he didn't communicate his actions to her. In a relationship, sharing such a personal collection might be important for her to feel that his love is genuine and not calculated.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The intention was good, but the action (keeping a secret) led to hurt feelings. The wrong might not be in the act of keeping the notes, but in not discussing it with his wife. If he had shared his method of remembering things, maybe she wouldn't have felt betrayed. But since he kept it a secret, it's possible he was wrong in not being transparent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife's reaction is over the top. She could have just asked about it instead of feeling betrayed. But from her perspective, finding out he had a \"playbook\" could make her feel like his love is transactional. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the mistake is not in the action itself but in the lack of communication. So the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the Almanac with his wife. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes), he is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his intentions and actions, leading to hurt and mistrust.\n"
