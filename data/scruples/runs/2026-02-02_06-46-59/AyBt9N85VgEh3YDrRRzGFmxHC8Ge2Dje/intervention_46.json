She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an Almanac, which is a notebook of personal details about his wife. His wife found it and feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like the sweet gestures were cheapened.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was good. He wanted to remember important things about his wife to do thoughtful things for her. But the issue here is about trust and transparency. The fact that he kept this notebook a secret is key. Even though he didn't show it to anyone, the act of keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge might have made her feel like he was strategizing or planning, rather than genuinely remembering her preferences from the heart.\n\nThe wife's reaction is significant. She says that the Almanac cheapened every sweet thing he did. That suggests she feels like his gestures were insincere because they were based on a written list. People often value spontaneous or heartfelt actions more than those that seem rehearsed or planned, even if the intention is good. The term \"playbook\" implies that he's following a script, which can undermine trust because it might seem like he's trying to manipulate or impress her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's trying to be a good husband and not forget her preferences. But in relationships, transparency is important. If he had shared this with her earlier, maybe she would have understood his intentions. The secrecy might have contributed to her feeling betrayed, even if he had no ill intent.\n\nAnother angle is the perception of privacy. The notebook contains personal details about her, and keeping it private might be seen as a violation of trust. Even if it's for good reasons, keeping such a thing hidden can lead to misunderstandings. The wife might wonder if there's more to it, like if he's keeping track for other reasons or if her personal details are being used in a way she's uncomfortable with.\n\nAlso, the wife's emotional reaction is a red flag. She's dejected and considering destroying the notebook, which shows a significant impact on their relationship. The author's fear of losing the notebook and wanting to keep it suggests he values his own method of remembering things over her feelings in this situation, which isn't ideal.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had discussed his method of taking notes with her and explained his intentions, maybe she would have seen it as thoughtful. But since he kept it a secret, her reaction is a natural response to feeling like she's been kept in the dark about something personal.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were good, the lack of communication and the secrecy around the Almanac likely caused the problem. The wife's feelings of betrayal and the impact on their relationship indicate that the author is in the wrong for not being open about his actions. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
