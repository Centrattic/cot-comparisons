She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Almanac is in the wrong. The situation is that he kept a notebook with personal details about his wife to remember things he likes her, but she found out and felt betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook\" and cheapening his efforts. The author is confused because he thought it showed love, not manipulation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife to show his love. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. On the other hand, his wife felt that by having a list, it made her feel like he was just using a script to get brownie points, which undermined genuine efforts. She might feel that the sweet gestures should come from the heart, not from a written list, which could make her feel like he's not truly attentive or present in the moment.\n\nIs keeping the Almanac inherently wrong? Maybe not. But the issue here is the wife's reaction. If the husband had discussed this with her first, maybe they could have had a conversation about how she felt about it. Since he didn't, and now she feels betrayed, maybe he should have considered her feelings more. The problem isn't the notebook itself, but the lack of communication and the fact that his actions didn't align with her expectations of what genuine love looks like.\n\nAlternatively, if the husband's intention was pure and he didn't mean to manipulate, then he's not in the wrong. But the fact that his actions led to hurt feelings and a sense of betrayal suggests that there was a misstep in how he expressed his love. It's possible that the wife values spontaneity and personal connection over planned gestures from a list, so the husband's approach clashed with her preferences.\n\nIn relationships, what matters is how both partners feel. Even if the intention is good, if the action causes distress, it's something to address. The husband might need to acknowledge her feelings and find a middle ground. However, whether that makes him \"in the wrong\" depends on whether he had a duty to consider her perspective beforehand. Since he didn't know how she would react, maybe he wasn't wrong, but he should have communicated better.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be that he isn't in the wrong (B), but he should work on understanding her feelings. However, if the act of keeping a secret list to \"script\" gestures is seen as manipulative, then maybe he is (A). The line here is between a genuine effort to remember and a manipulative playbook. Since he stated he did it out of love and not for status, it's more about differing perceptions. So perhaps the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but he needs to address her feelings.\n"
