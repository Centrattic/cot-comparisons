She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who created an \"Almanac\" to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite things and such. The problem is that she found out, and she's upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that he's betraying her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author didn't mean any harm; he made the Almanac to remember things he wanted to remember because he loves her. He never showed it to anyone, kept it private. But when his wife found out, she felt it cheapened the sweet things he did, and she's upset. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was good. He wanted to remember important details about his wife, which shows he cares. People often use notes or lists to help them remember things, especially if they're trying to be attentive partners. The fact that he's been doing this for years and it's a personal notebook seems like a positive thing. He didn't use it to manipulate or anything, just to remember.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is feeling betrayed. Maybe she felt that he was being inauthentic, that he's relying on a script rather than genuinely remembering from his heart. She might have expected that if he truly loved her, he would remember these things naturally without needing to write them down. There's a sense that the act of having a written list makes the gestures feel less genuine, which could hurt her feelings.\n\nThe key issue here is about perception and expectations in a relationship. The husband's actions were well-intentioned, but they didn't align with his wife's feelings. Even if he had good intentions, if the effect is negative, that's a problem. However, the husband isn't doing anything malicious. He didn't share it with others, and it's meant to help him be a better partner.\n\nIn relationships, communication is important. The husband might not have realized that his wife would see the Almanac as a playbook. Maybe a better approach would have been to discuss with her how he keeps track of these things, but since he didn't, her reaction is valid. But is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions crossed a line. Since he didn't use the Almanac to deceive or manipulate, and his intentions were good, it's more about a misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). The problem is more about differing perspectives and how the wife interprets his actions. The husband isn't at fault for wanting to remember important things about his wife, even if his method led to her feeling hurt. The responsibility might also be on the wife to communicate her feelings, but the husband isn't wrong for creating the Almanac in the first place.\n"
