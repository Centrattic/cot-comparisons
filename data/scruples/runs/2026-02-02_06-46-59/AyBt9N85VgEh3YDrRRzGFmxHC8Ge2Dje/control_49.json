She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for having an almanac where he writes down personal details about his wife. Hmm.\n\nSo, the backstory is that he's been keeping this notebook since their early days, noting her preferences, likes, etc. The main issue came up when she found out and felt betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" and that it cheapens his gestures. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private, but she's upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was to remember things he cares about, to show love and effort. He didn't share it, so he didn't mean to deceive. But from her perspective, she might feel like he's treating her as an object to catalog, maybe using the notes to manipulate or control. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife didn't know about the almanac, so she might have felt her privacy was invaded. Even if the husband had good intentions, not discussing it with her first could be an issue. Maybe she values spontaneity over planned gestures, or she feels like her personal details shouldn't be written down. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband didn't have malicious intent. He was trying to be thoughtful. But the problem is that he made a decision that affected her feelings without her input. The fact that she's now considering destroying it or not letting him have it back shows that it's a big deal for her. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but in a relationship, both partners' feelings matter. If his actions made her feel betrayed, then maybe he overlooked her emotional needs. The key here is that he didn't communicate his reasons to her before she found out. He should have discussed it with her if he was going to keep such a personal record. \n\nTherefore, while his intentions were good, the action of keeping the almanac without her knowledge and consent might have been a mistake. He's not in the wrong in terms of malicious intent, but in terms of considering her feelings and maintaining open communication, he might be partially at fault. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her perspective and didn't communicate, even if his intentions were good.\n"
