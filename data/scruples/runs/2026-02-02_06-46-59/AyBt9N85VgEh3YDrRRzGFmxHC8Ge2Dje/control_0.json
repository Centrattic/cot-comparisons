She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author, who's married to Sara, started keeping a notebook called \"The Almanac\" to remember important details about her. He started this after their first date when she mentioned loving lilacs. He wrote down her favorite things, and used it to remember and do sweet things for her. But when Sara found the notebook, she was upset. She felt like it was a \"playbook\" and that he was using it to do sweet things, which made her feel betrayed. Now the author is worried she might destroy the Almanac and is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intention behind the Almanac and how Sara perceived it. The author's intention was to remember important details about his wife to show his love and care. He didn't intend to deceive or manipulate; he just wanted to be a thoughtful partner. However, Sara's reaction is about feeling that her husband's actions were insincere. She might feel that instead of genuinely remembering these things, he was using a list, which made her feel like his gestures were premeditated rather than heartfelt. \n\nIn relationships, trust and how each person perceives actions are crucial. The author didn't hide the Almanac maliciously; he just kept it private because it's personal. But when Sara found out, she felt betrayed, which suggests that the issue might be about the perception of authenticity. Even though the author's intentions were good, Sara might feel that keeping such a detailed record implies that he can't remember things without it, or that he's treating their relationship like a strategy. \n\nHowever, the author argues that he's trying to avoid being the kind of husband who forgets important things. The act of writing things down to remember is a common practice for many people. The problem here is that Sara took it as manipulative rather than a genuine effort to remember her preferences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions were wrong in intent or if the issue is purely about Sara's feelings. Since he didn't lie about the Almanac's purpose and was using it to enhance their relationship, maybe he's not in the wrong. But from Sara's perspective, the way she felt (betrayed, like it's a playbook) is valid. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong, not whether Sara's feelings are justified. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the answer often hinges on whether the person did something objectively wrong or if it's a misunderstanding. Here, the author didn't do anything deceitful; he kept notes to be thoughtful. So maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But I need to make sure. The problem is that Sara feels the gestures are now cheapened because he used a list. The author should have considered how she might feel about being reminded that he needed a list to remember things. Perhaps he should have discussed it with her earlier, but he didn't have bad intentions. So overall, the author isn't in the wrong; it's more about their communication and differing perspectives.\n"
