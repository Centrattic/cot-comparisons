She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac, which is a notebook with info about his wife. The wife got upset and felt betrayed.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to remember things about his wife, which is a good thing. He wasn't sharing it with anyone, so maybe his privacy was the issue. But why did the wife get upset? She thought he remembered things naturally, and the almanac made her feel like he was just using a playbook. That could make her feel like he's not genuine, like he's just going through a list. \n\nIn relationships, authenticity is important. If she felt like his gestures were insincere because he was using a list, that could hurt her feelings. Even if his intention was good, the way it came across might have been the problem. Maybe she didn't like the idea that he needed to write things down to remember, making her question if he truly values her naturally.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author was trying to show love by remembering details. He didn't share it with others, so he didn't mean to deceive. The wife's reaction might be about her personal feelings rather than the author's actions. So, is it the author's fault or the wife's sensitivity? \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that keeping such a list is a personal choice, but when it affects the partner's perception, it's a gray area. The key is whether the author's actions were harmful. He wasn't using the list for anything bad, just to remember. But the fact that it made his wife feel betrayed is significant. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were good. But there's a middle ground where maybe he should have considered her feelings more. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the wife's reaction. Since the author didn't do anything malicious, it's not entirely his fault.\n"
