She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he created this \"Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and stuff she told him. He used it to remember things to do sweet things for her. But she found out, and now she's upset, feeling betrayed, thinking it's a playbook rather than a genuine effort.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's intention was to remember important details about his wife to show he cares, right? He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. He thought by writing things down, he could avoid forgetting and make her feel appreciated. But when she found out, she took it as insincere. She felt that instead of him genuinely remembering, he was just using a notebook, which made her feel like his gestures weren't heartfelt.\n\nSo the question is whether the author did something wrong. The key factors here are: the intent, the wife's reaction, and the perspective of the relationship. The author says he had no ulterior motives, just wanted to remember. But the wife saw it as a tactic, not genuine love. \n\nIn relationships, trust and feeling genuine are important. If the wife feels that his actions are not authentic, that could be a problem. But the author didn't do anything deceptive. He didn't show the Almanac to anyone, and he used it to remember. However, maybe the issue is that she felt he was not truly paying attention and instead relied on a notebook. Some might argue that being attentive without needing to write things down is better, but others might say that using a tool to remember is okay as long as the intent is good.\n\nBut the wife's reaction is strong. She felt betrayed and cheapened. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of actions, but maybe in terms of not considering her perspective. Maybe she wanted him to remember without needing to write it down, seeing the notebook as a crutch that makes his gestures less sincere. So the problem isn't the notebook itself, but the way it made her feel about his intentions and effort.\n\nIs the author at fault? It depends on whether the method of using the Almanac is a problem. If the intention was good and the action was not harmful, but the wife feels hurt, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the Almanac was a way to manipulate or insincerely impress her, then yes. But the author says he didn't use it for brownie points. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But the real issue is communication. He didn't realize that she might have a different view on how he keeps track of her preferences. So maybe he should explain his intentions, but he's not necessarily wrong. The problem is more about differing perspectives in the relationship. So the answer would be B.\n"
