She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" with notes on his wife's preferences and memories. His wife found it and now feels hurt, thinking it's a playbook, and is upset. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's intention was to remember important things about his wife because he loves her and wants to be a thoughtful partner. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. On the other hand, the wife feels betrayed and like the sweet gestures were insincere because they were from a list. \n\nPossible reasons why she's upset: Maybe she felt like he wasn't genuinely paying attention, that he's using a list instead of naturally remembering, or that he's keeping secrets. The term \"playbook\" suggests she might think he's strategizing his affection, which could feel manipulative. Even though his intent was good, her emotional reaction is valid. \n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, keeping notes isn't inherently wrong. People have different ways of showing love. However, not considering how she might feel about it could be a misstep. He didn't think about her perspective\u2014maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory over written reminders. Also, the secrecy around the notebook might have contributed to her feeling like he wasn't open with her. \n\nBut he didn't have malicious intent. He was trying to be romantic. So maybe the issue is more about communication and differing love languages. The husband isn't wrong in his actions, but perhaps he should have discussed it with her to ensure it aligned with her feelings. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, not just a misunderstanding, it's a bit tricky. \n\nIn relationships, intentions matter, but so does how actions affect the partner. If his actions caused her pain, even unintentionally, maybe he's not in the wrong, but he needs to address her feelings. The answer could hinge on whether the action itself was wrong or if it's a matter of differing expectations. Since the husband's intent was good and the issue is about perception, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for interpretation. However, considering that he kept it secret and she felt betrayed, maybe there's a case for A. But the key is that he didn't do anything deceptive beyond keeping the notebook private. The main conflict is about how she perceives his gestures. So ultimately, the husband's action isn't wrong; it's more about their communication styles. Therefore, answer B.\n"
