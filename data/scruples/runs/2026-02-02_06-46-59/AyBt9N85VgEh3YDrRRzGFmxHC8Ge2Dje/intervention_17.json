She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" where he writes down personal details about his wife. The situation is that the wife found out and feels that it cheapens the sweet things he does for her, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. The author is confused because he meant it as a romantic gesture to remember important things about her, not as a manipulative list.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good; he wanted to remember her preferences to show his love. He didn't share it with anyone and only used it for his own benefit, which seems genuine. On the other hand, the wife's reaction is about feeling like he's treating their relationship like a script, which could make her feel objectified or like he's using the notes to get points rather than truly being in love with her as a person. \n\nThere might be a cultural or emotional component here. Some people might see keeping a detailed list as insincere, like he's planning every gesture rather than naturally remembering, which could come off as manipulative. Others might see it as thoughtful. The key point is that the wife felt betrayed, which suggests that the action, although well-intentioned, caused harm. \n\nThe author didn't consider her perspective beforehand. Maybe he should have discussed the idea with her to ensure she felt comfortable with it. The fact that she was upset by it without him realizing shows a possible lack of communication. However, the author's intent was positive, so it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the action caused emotional distress, then the author might be in the wrong, even if unintentionally. But if the intentions were good and the wife's reaction is about personal boundaries, it's a matter of differing expectations. The question is whether the author's actions were inherently wrong or if the issue is a misunderstanding. Since the wife's feelings are valid, and the author didn't consider her potential discomfort, it's possible he's in the wrong. However, some might argue it's a misunderstanding rather than being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because the author's action, while well-meaning, led to his wife feeling betrayed and objectified. He didn't consider her perspective, and even if he didn't mean to, the effect was harmful. The fact that she felt the need to take the book and potentially destroy it shows the depth of her hurt, which the author may bear some responsibility for.\n"
