She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an Almanac where he writes down personal details about his wife. So, the author started keeping notes on his wife's preferences and things she mentioned, like her love for lilacs. He uses this to remember stuff and do sweet things for her. But his wife found out and is upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. She's considering destroying it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the intention versus the effect. The author's intention was to remember his wife's preferences and show his love by keeping track. But the wife perceives it as insincere or manipulative, like he's using a \"playbook\" instead of genuinely remembering things from their relationship. So the question is whether his action was wrong.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, some people might feel uncomfortable if they think their partner is keeping notes as a strategy rather than organically remembering. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the wife's reaction is valid. Trust and authenticity are important in relationships. The author might need to consider why she feels that way. Maybe she values spontaneity or feels that the notes make his gestures feel rehearsed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that he wants to be a considerate partner and avoid being forgetful. He's not sharing it with anyone, just using it as a personal tool. But the issue is how his wife interprets it. The problem isn't the act of taking notes per se, but the perception that it's inauthentic. The answer might depend on whether the intention is seen as genuine.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of his actions, but maybe in how it's affecting his wife. The real issue is the wife's feelings of betrayal and the sense that the notes cheapen his efforts. The author should probably reflect on whether there's a way to show his love without making her feel like he's using a script. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't intend to hurt her, but the action caused harm, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his intent was good, but he needs to address her feelings.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that keeping such a detailed record could be seen as manipulative, regardless of intent, making him at fault. But given the context, the author's actions seem well-meaning. So the answer is likely B.\n"
