She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who keeps an almanac, a notebook with all the personal details about his wife, like her favorite things, etc. He did this because he wanted to remember things to do sweet things for her. But his wife found out and felt betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" and that he's cheapening their relationship.\n\nHmm, first, the guy's intention was good. He wanted to remember important things about his wife, which shows he cares. But the problem is how his wife perceived it. She felt like he was treating their relationship like a strategy, using a playbook. That's a big issue because trust and respect are crucial in relationships. Even if his intent was good, if it made her feel like he's manipulating or keeping track for his own purposes, that could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the fact that he kept it a secret might play a role. If he had shared this with her before, maybe she would have understood his intention. But keeping it hidden might make her feel like he wasn't being transparent. Secrets, even small ones, can cause mistrust. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be overreacting. Maybe she's feeling insecure or there's another issue in their relationship. The guy didn't do anything harmful, but the way he kept the almanac might have made her feel less trusted. The key here is communication. If he had talked to her about his reasons, maybe they could have resolved this without conflict. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he might have handled it differently. The secrecy and the perception of using a \"playbook\" could be why the wife is upset. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the wife's feelings and the lack of communication, maybe he is partially at fault. But the main issue is the wife's reaction. Hmm, this is tricky. I'll go with B because his intentions were positive and he didn't mean to harm, but the situation could have been handled better.\n"
