She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having an almanac where he writes down personal details about his wife. \n\nFirst, the backstory: He started writing down things she told him because he wanted to remember them. He thought it was sweet and a way to show he cares. But now his wife is upset, feeling that it's a playbook and that it's cheapened his gestures. She feels betrayed and is considering destroying it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's feelings versus the husband's intentions. The husband's intention was to remember things to do nice things for her. But the wife's reaction is that it feels manipulative or like he's not genuine. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything malicious. He kept the notebook private, didn't share it with anyone. He thought he was showing love. But maybe the problem is that he didn't consider her perspective. The wife might feel that the notebook makes the acts feel insincere because they're planned based on written notes. Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory over something that's been documented. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying his best to remember things, which is a positive trait. But the issue is the method. The wife's reaction is valid because she feels hurt. The husband might not have realized that keeping a list could be perceived as a tactic rather than a heartfelt effort. \n\nSo, is he at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. If the husband had discussed the notebook with her before, maybe she would have appreciated it. But he didn't, and his actions, though well-intentioned, caused hurt. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If something causes a partner distress, even if the intention is good, it might be considered wrong because it affects the relationship negatively. So maybe answer A: Yes, he's in the wrong because his action, while well-meaning, didn't consider her feelings and caused harm. But others might say B, arguing that his intentions were good and the fault is hers for being upset. \n\nBut given that the wife's feelings are valid and he could have communicated better, I think A is the answer. He should have considered her feelings before keeping such a notebook.\n"
