She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The main issue is about the Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife. The wife found out and felt betrayed, thinking it's his \"playbook\" and that it cheapens his gestures.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the intentions. The author says he created the Almanac to remember important things about his wife because he didn't want to forget. He mentions that he uses it to do sweet things for her. So his intention is good\u2014he wants to show love and remember her preferences. But the wife is upset. She feels like he's using a playbook, which might imply she feels he's calculating or not genuine.\n\nBut why would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and authenticity. If he's using a notebook to remember, she might think he's not paying attention naturally. However, he's doing it because he wants to remember, which is a positive trait. The problem is the perception. Did he keep it a secret? Yes, he never showed it to anyone. Maybe she felt it was a lack of trust if he didn't share it before, but he explained he kept it private. \n\nIs keeping it a secret a problem? The author didn't hide it from her; the book just had the name on the cover. So she found it by accident. But maybe the act of keeping it private made her feel like he wasn't being open. However, he didn't lie about it when she asked. \n\nAnother angle: the wife's reaction might stem from feeling objectified. If he's keeping a list of her preferences, she might feel he's reducing her to a collection of traits. But the author's intention is to remember her, not to use her. It's a bit of a nuanced situation. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The wife's feeling of betrayal suggests that she might have felt her privacy was invaded. Even if he meant well, she might see it as him keeping something that shouldn't be documented. But he didn't do it maliciously. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends. If he never intended to hurt and was trying to be thoughtful, maybe not. But if the act of keeping the Almanac without discussing it with her beforehand caused her distress, maybe he should have considered her feelings more. However, the question is whether he is objectively in the wrong. \n\nThe answer might be B (No), because his intentions were good, and he didn't mean to betray her. The problem is more about differing perspectives on privacy and authenticity in relationships. It's a communication issue rather than a clear wrongdoing.\n"
