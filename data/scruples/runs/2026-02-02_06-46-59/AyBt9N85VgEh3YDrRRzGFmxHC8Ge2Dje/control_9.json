She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The story is about the author keeping an almanac of their wife's preferences and details to remember them. The wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like the sweet gestures were cheapened.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the intent behind the almanac and the wife's reaction. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife because he wanted to show his love and avoid forgetting. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. The wife, on the other hand, felt that having a written list made his actions seem insincere, like he was just following a script. She might value spontaneity or genuine memory over written notes.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, intent is important. He didn't have malicious intent; he wanted to be a good partner. But maybe the action of keeping a detailed list is what caused the problem. The wife might have felt that the effort should come from the heart rather than being premeditated. Also, the fact that she's hurt shows that he didn't consider her feelings about how she prefers to receive affection.\n\nHowever, the author wasn't hiding it maliciously. He didn't know she felt that way. He kept it private, thinking it was a good way to remember. The problem is more about differing expectations in relationships. Some people might see it as a sweet gesture, others as inauthentic. Since the wife clearly expressed feeling betrayed, even though the intent was good, the action caused hurt. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not considering her perspective. But is that his responsibility? He tried to be thoughtful, but missed how she perceived it.\n\nIn relationships, sometimes intentions matter, but so does how the other person feels. Even if the intent is good, if it causes harm, the person might need to adjust. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't realize that his method of showing love was making his wife feel unappreciated or like she was being played. So the answer could be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. The key is whether the action itself is wrong. Since the author had good intentions and no malicious intent, maybe it's not his fault. But the result is that he hurt her feelings. In that case, maybe it's a gray area. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer might be B, but I'm not sure. Wait, the user wants a clear A or B. Given that the author's intention was to be loving and helpful, but the wife felt it was inconsiderate, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intention was good, but maybe A because he should have considered how she might feel. Hmm. The story is from AITA (Am I the Asshole), so usually the answer depends on context. In this case, the wife's reaction is valid. The author kept something private that she found out about and was upset. He didn't consider her feelings. So maybe the answer is A. Alternatively, if the answer is B because the intention was good. But in the context of the relationship, if the wife is hurt, then the author is at least partially responsible for not understanding her feelings. So maybe A. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The author didn't do it to hurt her, but the action caused pain. So it's a relationship issue where both sides have valid points. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he didn't have malicious intent, but the outcome was negative, maybe the answer is B. But some might argue he should have known better. It's a tough call. I think in AITA, if the person's intent was good and they didn't do anything illegal or unethical, they might be considered not in the wrong. So B.\n"
