She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who kept a detailed notebook called \"The Almanac\" with information about his wife's preferences and memories. His wife found out and felt betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine effort to remember things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was to remember important details about his wife because he wanted to show his love and care. He didn't share the notebook with anyone and kept it private. On the other hand, the wife felt that having the notebook made her feel like her husband wasn't genuinely remembering her; instead, he was just using a list. She might see it as a lack of authenticity or even manipulation, even if that's not his intention.\n\nIs the husband wrong for keeping the notebook? Well, his actions were meant to be loving. However, the issue here might be about transparency and how his actions made his wife feel. The wife's feelings of betrayal and being cheapened suggest that the husband's method of remembering things through a written list might not have been the right approach for her. Maybe she values spontaneous, heartfelt gestures more than planned ones based on a list. The husband didn't intend to make her feel that way, but the result is that she's hurt. \n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The husband's intent was to be loving and attentive, but the impact on his wife was negative. In relationships, communication is crucial. If the husband had explained his reasoning behind the notebook, maybe she would have understood better. However, since he kept it a secret, even though it was for a good reason, it could be seen as a lack of trust or respect for her autonomy. \n\nAnother angle is trust. By keeping the notebook a secret, the husband might have unintentionally made his wife feel like he wasn't fully honest with her. Even if the purpose was good, the act of keeping such a detailed record without sharing it could be perceived as manipulative. The wife's reaction indicates that she felt her personal information was being used in a way she didn't agree to. \n\nBut then again, the husband had no malicious intent. He was trying to be a good partner by remembering important things. The problem is more about differing perspectives on how to show love and affection. Some people might see a notebook as a helpful tool, while others might find it impersonal. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If the answer hinges on intent, then he might not be in the wrong because his actions were well-meaning. But if the answer focuses on the impact and communication, then he could be at fault for not considering how his actions would be received. The fact that he didn't discuss the notebook with her before or after creating it might be a point against him. \n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's intentions were positive, the lack of communication and the way his actions affected his wife's feelings could place some responsibility on him. Therefore, he might be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the wife's justified feelings of betrayal, the answer could lean towards A (Yes). But others might argue he's not in the wrong because his intentions were good. It's a bit of a tricky call.\n"
