She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the Almanac, which is a notebook where the husband writes down personal details about his wife. The wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand their positions. The husband created the Almanac as a way to remember important things about his wife so he could do sweet things for her. He kept it private, never showed anyone else, and didn't mention it before. The wife, on the other hand, feels that having the Almanac cheapened his gestures and called it a \"playbook,\" implying she felt like he was just following a script instead of genuinely caring.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's trying to be thoughtful and attentive, which he believes shows his love. He didn't share it with anyone and didn't mean any harm. From the wife's side, she might feel that keeping such a detailed record of personal information is an invasion of privacy or that it makes his actions seem insincere. She might also feel that he didn't trust his memory or that he's treating their relationship like a game.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions vs. the perception. The husband's intentions were good, but the wife perceived it negatively. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the husband didn't have bad intentions and the wife's reaction is based on her feelings rather than any actual wrongdoing by him, then he might not be in the wrong. However, if he should have considered her feelings and privacy, maybe he was wrong to keep the notebook without discussing it.\n\nIn relationships, communication is often key. The husband might have assumed that keeping the notes was a good idea without realizing how it could make his wife feel. Even if he had good intentions, if his actions caused his wife emotional distress, then he might be at fault. But since he didn't use the notes to manipulate or deceive, just to remember things, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal boundaries.\n\nIn some contexts, keeping a personal journal is private and harmless. But in a relationship, sharing such personal information might require mutual consent. The husband didn't ask her if it was okay, so maybe he overstepped. However, since he was trying to be loving, he might not be in the wrong. It's more about the wife's feelings here. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the intentions were good, but he should have discussed it with her earlier. But since he didn't, maybe A (in the wrong) because he didn't consider her perspective. Hmm.\n"
