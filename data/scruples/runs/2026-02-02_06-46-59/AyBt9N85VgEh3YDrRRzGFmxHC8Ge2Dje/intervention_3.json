She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down his wife's preferences and personal details. The wife found it and felt betrayed, thinking it was a playbook rather than a genuine love gesture.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the husband's intention was to remember things about his wife to show he cares, but he never told her about it. The wife's reaction was feeling like the sweet things he did were just from a playbook, which cheapened them. She's upset and the husband is confused, thinking he's done something good. \n\nThe user says they think the husband is in the wrong, but want my opinion. I need to figure out if not sharing this notebook was a mistake. On one hand, the husband's actions were from a place of love and effort to remember important things. On the other, the wife might have felt that keeping such a detailed record was inauthentic or manipulative. \n\nBut was the husband wrong? Well, he didn't lie about the content when asked, and the wife found it without him revealing it. Maybe the issue is about transparency. If he had shared it with her before, maybe she would have appreciated it. However, he kept it secret, which might have made her feel that he was hiding something. The wife's reaction could stem from insecurity or feeling that the gestures were insincere because he needed to reference them. \n\nBut intentions matter. The husband's intention was to remember, not to exploit. The problem is that the wife didn't know about the notebook and felt betrayed. So, the question is whether keeping a personal notebook of one's partner's preferences is inherently wrong. In my view, it's not wrong to want to remember things about your spouse. However, the lack of communication might be the issue here. The wife might have preferred that he told her about the notebook so she could understand his efforts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife is overreacting. The husband didn't use the notebook in a manipulative way; he created it to help himself remember. The term \"playbook\" could imply she thought he was scripting his actions, but that's her interpretation. The husband's secrecy might have led to her misunderstanding. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think maybe not. The act of keeping notes isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be more about the wife's perception and the lack of communication. The husband didn't use the notebook for any ulterior motive, but the fact that he kept it a secret and she found out this way caused hurt. \n\nBut does that make him the asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. The wife's feelings are valid, but the husband's intention was good. In relationships, transparency is important. If he had shown her the notebook earlier, maybe she would have seen it as a thoughtful gesture. However, since she found it without prior discussion, her reaction is understandable. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his intention was to remember and be thoughtful. The issue is more on the wife's side in terms of how she perceived it, but the husband didn't do anything malicious. The real problem might be a communication breakdown rather than him being in the wrong.\n"
