She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and personal details. He wrote this to remember things and do sweet things for her. However, his wife found the notebook and now feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like everything he did was cheapened. He's confused because he thought it was a loving gesture.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The answer should be A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are:\n\n1. The husband made a secret notebook about his wife's likes, which he used to remember things to do nice stuff for her. He didn't share it with anyone, not even her.\n2. The wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed. She thinks it's a playbook and that his gestures aren't genuine anymore.\n3. The husband is confused and thinks he was being loving and thoughtful.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Privacy and trust are important. Even if the intention was good, keeping such a detailed secret might be an issue. The wife might feel that the fact that he kept it secret implies that he wasn't being fully open with her. In relationships, transparency is key. If he had shared that he kept notes to remember her preferences, she might have appreciated it. But keeping it hidden could lead to mistrust. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction suggests that she values authenticity. If she feels that the gestures are based on a playbook rather than genuine effort, that's a problem. However, the husband's intent was to remember things he might forget, which is a valid reason. The issue is the secrecy. Maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he was trying to be loving. On the other, not discussing such a personal thing with his partner could be seen as a breach of trust. The wife's feelings are valid because she feels betrayed. So, the husband's mistake was keeping it a secret instead of being open about it. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong for not being transparent), but some might argue B (not in the wrong since the intent was good). However, in relationships, intent vs. impact matters. The impact here was negative, so maybe he's at least partially responsible for not considering her perspective and keeping it secret.\n"
