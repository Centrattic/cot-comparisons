She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The story is about a husband who kept a notebook called The Almanac with notes about his wife's preferences, like her favorite color, restaurants, etc. He did this to remember sweet things to do for her. But his wife got upset when she found it, feeling it cheapened the gestures and that it's like a \"playbook\" for him, leading to betrayal. The husband is confused and heartbroken because he thought it was a good thing, and now they're having issues.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes) and B (No). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband's intention: he wanted to remember his wife's preferences to do sweet things for her. That's good. He didn't share it with anyone and did it in private. But the wife's reaction is negative. Why?\n\nPossible reasons the wife is upset: maybe she felt it was inauthentic. Like, instead of genuinely remembering the things, he was just using a list, which made her feel like he wasn't truly paying attention or caring. The idea of a \"playbook\" suggests she thought he was being strategic or manipulative, using the notes to gain points in the relationship rather than showing real, spontaneous love. This could make her feel like her preferences are just part of a game to him, not something he truly values.\n\nAnother angle: trust and transparency. The husband kept the Almanac a secret, which might have made the wife feel like there was something hidden. Even if the intention was good, keeping it secret could be seen as a lack of trust or openness. She might have preferred that he share these gestures as they happened, rather than having a compiled list that he hadn't mentioned before.\n\nAlso, the wife might have felt that the notes were a way to control or predict her reactions, which could come off as insincere. If she thought he was using the list to plan things instead of being present, that could hurt her feelings. The betrayal could stem from not knowing about this secret list, making her question the authenticity of his actions.\n\nBut the husband's defense is that he was trying to be attentive and not be the guy who forgets important things. He didn't mean to make it a playbook. The question is whether his action, while well-intentioned, is wrong because it caused his wife emotional distress. The wife's reaction is valid from her perspective, even if the husband didn't intend it that way.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to understand each other's perspectives. If the wife felt this way, the husband should acknowledge her feelings. The fact that she found out and was hurt suggests that the method he used to remember wasn't the best approach. It's possible that she values genuine effort more than a written list, even if the list is kept private.\n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong in terms of intention, but maybe in how he went about it. The key issue here is the wife's feelings. Even if the action was meant to be loving, if it made her feel the opposite, then there's a problem. Whether it's the husband's fault depends on if he should have considered her perspective. Since he didn't realize it might come off as a playbook, maybe he didn't do anything malicious, but the lack of open communication could be a factor. However, the main point is the wife's emotional response. The husband should probably take responsibility for not understanding her feelings and work on finding a better way to show love without making her feel that way. But is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. The wife's feelings are valid, so maybe the husband is in the wrong for not seeing how it might affect her, even if it was unintentional.\n"
