She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Almanac is in the wrong here. The story is about a guy who kept a detailed notebook of his wife's preferences, things she likes, etc., to remember and use for sweet gestures. His wife found out and now feels betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook\" and cheapening his actions. The author is confused and heartbroken, thinking he's being a good husband by remembering these things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's intention was good\u2014to remember important details about his wife to show his love. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. But the wife's reaction is strong. She felt that having a written list made his gestures feel insincere, like he was just following a script. This could make her feel like he wasn't being genuine, that his actions were calculated rather than heartfelt. \n\nIn relationships, authenticity is often key. If one person feels that another is using a \"playbook,\" it can create a sense of inauthenticity. Even though the husband's intentions were good, the wife's feelings are valid. He might have thought he was doing something sweet, but the way it was received is negative. The fact that she took the book without him knowing could also be a point\u2014maybe she felt it was an invasion of privacy to see that he had a list. But he didn't show it to anyone, so maybe she felt it was a breach of trust when she found it. \n\nAnother angle: the husband didn't mention the Almanac to her before, even though he used it. If he had shared this with her, maybe she would have appreciated the effort. Keeping it secret might have made her feel like he wasn't being transparent. Trust and communication are important in a relationship. Not discussing something that personal might have contributed to her feeling betrayed. \n\nBut then again, the husband's actions were meant to be a way to express love and care. He wasn't using the book to manipulate or deceive; he genuinely wanted to remember. The problem seems to be a mismatch in expectations and how they perceive gestures of love. The wife might value spontaneous, heartfelt actions over planned ones, even if they're based on genuine care. \n\nIs he in the wrong? If his intention was pure, but the execution led to her feeling hurt, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, not considering her perspective on the matter and not communicating could be a fault. He might have assumed that documenting things was a good idea without realizing how she might perceive it. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the husband's actions, though well-intentioned, crossed a line into making his wife feel manipulated, even if that wasn't the intent. If the wife's feelings are valid and he should have considered her perspective earlier, then he might be at fault. But if his actions were meant to be loving and the problem is her interpretation, then maybe he's not. \n\nIn similar \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the line is often about intent vs. impact. The impact here was negative, but the intent was positive. However, if he didn't consider how she might feel about being treated like a list, that's a problem. Maybe he should have discussed his approach with her. \n\nSo, I think the answer is that the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider how his secret list might make his wife feel. Even though his intentions were good, the method of keeping it secret and using it as a \"playbook\" without her knowledge led to her feeling betrayed. The key is that he didn't communicate his intentions, and she interpreted the list as a script rather than a genuine effort. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings and for not being transparent.\n"
