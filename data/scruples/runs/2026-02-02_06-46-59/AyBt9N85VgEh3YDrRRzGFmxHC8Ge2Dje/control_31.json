She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an Almanac of his wife's preferences. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband created a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife\u2014her favorite things, etc. He uses it to remember and do sweet things for her. But when she found it, she felt betrayed, called it a \"playbook,\" and now they're having issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband's intention was to be thoughtful, he kept it secret, and the wife felt it was inauthentic or manipulative. \n\nWhy would the wife feel that way? Maybe she felt like he wasn't genuinely remembering things because he had to write them down, or she saw it as a strategy rather than true care. Some people might feel that writing things down implies they can't remember naturally, which could hurt her feelings. Others might see it as a thoughtful way to keep track.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, his intentions were good. He wanted to show love by remembering things. But maybe he didn't consider her perspective. If she felt like the notes were a trick or that he wasn't really paying attention, then maybe he should not have done it that way. However, everyone has different ways of showing love. Some people are naturally good at remembering, others need to write things down. The issue might be about communication\u2014maybe he should have talked to her about his method before she found out.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his actions were meant to be caring and they backfired because of miscommunication, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if his approach made her feel like he was insincere, then perhaps he should have chosen a different method. The fact that she felt betrayed suggests that the method wasn't appropriate for her. \n\nIn relationships, what matters is how each person perceives actions. Even with good intentions, if the action causes hurt, it's a problem. But the husband didn't have bad intentions. So maybe it's a matter of differing expectations. He might need to discuss why she felt that way and find a compromise. \n\nSo, based on the info given, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong) because his intentions were positive, but he needs to address her feelings. She's upset because of her perception, not his actual intent. Unless there was a breach of trust (he didn't hide it maliciously), he's not wrong for trying to remember things. The problem is more about their communication styles than his actions being inherently wrong.\n"
