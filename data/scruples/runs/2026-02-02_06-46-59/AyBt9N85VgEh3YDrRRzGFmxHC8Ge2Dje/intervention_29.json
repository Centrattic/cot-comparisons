She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who kept an almanac with notes about his wife's preferences. The wife found out and felt betrayed, thinking it's a playbook instead of a genuine effort to remember things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's intention. He wrote things down because he wanted to remember important details about his wife to show he cares. That's a positive intention. But the wife interpreted it as manipulative, like he's using a playbook, which made her feel cheapened. \n\nThe key points here are communication and perception. The husband didn't mean to hurt her, but he didn't realize that keeping such a detailed record could be seen as insincere. Even if his actions were genuine, the way he went about it might have been misunderstood. \n\nDid he do anything inherently wrong? He kept the notes private, didn't share them with anyone, and used them to do kind things. But the problem is that his wife's feelings were hurt. So while his intent was good, the effect was negative. \n\nIn relationships, how we express care matters. The wife might need to feel that her partner's efforts are spontaneous and heartfelt, not rehearsed or written down. The husband's method, though well-meaning, crossed into making her feel like she was being cataloged instead of genuinely remembered. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't have bad intentions, but he failed to consider her feelings. In that sense, he might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his reasons and didn't foresee how she might feel. Alternatively, some might say he's not in the wrong because he was trying to be thoughtful. \n\nBut considering that the wife's reaction is valid and her feelings matter, the husband should have been more mindful of how she might perceive his actions. Therefore, even if unintentionally, his actions caused hurt, making him at least partially in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
