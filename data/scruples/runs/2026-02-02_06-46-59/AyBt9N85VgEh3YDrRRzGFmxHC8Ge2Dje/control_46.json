She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of his wife's preferences. \n\nFirst, the almanac started as a way for the husband to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite things. He created it because he wanted to do sweet things for her and not forget. That seems like a good intention.\n\nHowever, his wife found out and felt betrayed. She called it a \"playbook,\" which makes her feel like he's just using it to manipulate her. The key here is the perception. Even though his intentions were good, she might feel that he's being insincere or manipulative by keeping track so meticulously. \n\nThe husband didn't show it to anyone else, which suggests he didn't intend to use it in a negative way. But the fact that he kept it a secret could have contributed to her feeling that he was hiding something. Maybe she would have preferred him to remember things naturally rather than relying on notes. \n\nAlso, she mentioned that it \"cheapened\" every sweet thing he did. This implies that she feels the gestures are not genuine anymore because they're based on a list. The husband might need to consider that some people prefer spontaneous acts of love rather than planned ones from a list. \n\nThe problem here is a mismatch in expectations. The husband thought keeping notes was a way to show love, but his wife interpreted it as manipulative. The question is whether the husband's actions, although well-meaning, were wrong because they caused his wife emotional distress. \n\nSo, while the husband isn't malicious, his actions led to hurt feelings. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he might need to understand her perspective better. However, since the wife is upset, he might need to adjust his approach. \n\nThe options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong). Considering the intentions vs. the impact, the answer might lean towards B (No) because he had good intentions and didn't mean to hurt her. But some might argue that he should have considered her feelings before keeping such a list. \n\nBut in the context of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format, usually, if someone's actions, even with good intentions, make the other person feel uncomfortable or betrayed, it might be considered AITA. However, since the community often looks at intentions and context, maybe here it's B. \n\nBut the wife's reaction is strong, and the husband didn't think about how she might perceive it. Maybe the issue is that he kept it a secret, which could imply lack of transparency. So maybe A. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The key points are: good intentions, but the wife felt betrayed. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he didn't mean to, but it's a communication issue. So B.\n"
