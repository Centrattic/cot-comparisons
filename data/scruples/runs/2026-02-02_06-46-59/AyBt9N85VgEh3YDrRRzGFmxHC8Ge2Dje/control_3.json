She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author wrote down personal details about his wife in something called \"The Almanac.\" He did this to remember things she mentioned, like her favorite flowers, colors, restaurants, etc. The idea was to have a reference so he could do sweet things for her. But now she's upset, feeling betrayed, and thinks it's a \"playbook.\" She might even destroy it.\n\nHmm, why is she upset? Well, maybe she feels like he's not genuinely remembering these things from his heart, but instead is just using a list. It's possible that she wanted him to remember without needing notes, which might be an indicator of how much he truly cares. If he's relying on notes, maybe she feels it's not sincere. Like, if you have to write it down, does that mean you can't remember it on your own?\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's intention was to show he cares. He didn't want to forget important things about her. It's a way to personalize his gestures. Maybe in his mind, keeping notes is a way to ensure he's thoughtful. However, his wife's reaction suggests that she values genuine memory over written references. There's a difference between remembering because you care and remembering because you wrote it down. \n\nAnother angle: privacy. Did he share the Almanac with others? The author says he didn't show it to anyone. So it's private. But the act of keeping a secret collection of personal notes might have been something she expected to be known about, or maybe not. If he made a point of not telling anyone, including her, maybe she feels it's a lack of transparency. She didn't know about it, and now that she does, she's upset. \n\nEmotionally, she might feel like the notes make his affection seem insincere or like he's going through the motions. If he's using the Almanac to plan gestures, maybe she wants the spontaneity and authenticity of him remembering on his own. The betrayal could come from feeling like his actions are premeditated from a list rather than heartfelt.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it depends on the perspective. If the intention was good, but the action caused hurt feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong, but he's made a misstep. However, if his wife clearly values his genuine memory and the act of writing things down undermines that, then maybe he shouldn't have done it. But he did it to remember, which is a positive intent. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The problem isn't that he's wrong, but that there's a mismatch in expectations. He thought keeping notes was a loving gesture to ensure he remembers; she feels it diminishes the sincerity of his gestures. In relationships, communication is key. He didn't mention the Almanac before, so she discovered it on her own, leading to hurt feelings. Perhaps he should have discussed it with her earlier, but the act itself might not be wrong. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the question is whether his action was wrong regardless of intent, then maybe not. But if the issue is that he didn't consider her feelings about it, then maybe. But the question is whether AITA. The answer usually depends on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In many cases, the husband's actions are seen as loving, but the wife's feelings are valid. The author might not be in the wrong, but he needs to address the communication gap. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
