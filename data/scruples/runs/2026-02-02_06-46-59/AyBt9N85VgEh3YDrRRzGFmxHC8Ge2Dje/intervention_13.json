She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of his wife's preferences and things. \n\nFirst, the backstory: He started writing things down because he wanted to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite flowers, colors, etc. The idea was to make sure he didn't forget and could do sweet things for her. Now his wife found the notebook and feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" which made her feel like the gestures were insincere.\n\nHmm. The husband's intention was good, right? He wanted to remember things to show his love. But the wife's reaction is negative. That's the crux. The key points here are about transparency and trust. Did he keep this secret from her? Yes. He never told her about the notebook, and she found out by surprise. She might have felt that he wasn't genuine because he was using a list to \"script\" his actions rather than doing them from the heart. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions were motivated by love. He didn't share it because he didn't think it was a big deal and just wanted to do nice things for her. But maybe the fact that he didn't communicate this to her was the issue. When someone feels like their partner is using a list to make gestures, it can come across as insincere, even if the intent is good.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the wife values spontaneity and genuine memory over written records. If she felt that the husband wasn't making an effort to remember naturally, she might feel that the almanac was a crutch. The surprise of finding it might have made her feel like all the sweet things he did were just from a list, hence the betrayal.\n\nBut then again, the husband's actions were meant to show his love. If he truly didn't consider it a secret and just wanted to remember, maybe he didn't mean to deceive. However, the secrecy around it is what caused the problem. The wife didn't know, and the discovery led to hurt feelings because she perceived it as inauthentic.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he didn't have malicious intent. But maybe he should have discussed it with her. Keeping such a personal item hidden might not be inherently wrong, but the impact on the wife's feelings shows that communication was lacking. The problem arises from the wife's emotional reaction, which the husband didn't anticipate. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the husband had shared his intentions earlier, maybe the situation would have been different. But since he acted with good intentions and didn't mean to hurt her, some might say he's not in the wrong. However, others might argue that the act of keeping a secret list, even with good intentions, could be seen as manipulative or insincere, hence he is in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh both sides. The question is whether the husband's actions, though well-meaning, were wrong because they caused his wife distress. In relationships, intentions matter, but so do the effects. The husband's effect was negative. So maybe he is in the wrong for not considering how his actions might be perceived.\n\nBut again, maybe the wife's reaction is overreacting. It's possible that she's projecting her own insecurities or has different expectations about relationships. The husband's approach might be a perfectly valid way for him to show love, but she interpreted it as a betrayal.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the secrecy and the method of showing love crossed a line. Since the wife felt betrayed and the husband didn't communicate his intentions, the answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong (A) because his actions, though well-intentioned, caused harm due to lack of transparency. Alternatively, if the husband's actions are seen as a personal way to express love without malice, then he's not in the wrong (B). But considering the wife's perspective and the resulting emotional impact, the answer could be A.\n"
