She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for keeping an \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook with notes about their wife's preferences and things they want to remember. The wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed, thinking the notes cheapen the sweet gestures.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about consent and transparency in relationships. The author didn't tell his wife about the notebook, which he started using to remember her likes and dislikes. He thought it was a personal way to show love by remembering details. But the wife found out and it made her uncomfortable. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, in relationships, communication is key. Even if the intention was good, keeping something like this a secret might have been an issue. The wife might have felt that the notes made the gestures feel insincere or manipulative, like he's just following a script (hence the \"playbook\" comment). \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to be attentive and remember things. But maybe the method of keeping it private was the problem. If he had shared the notebook with her or explained it, maybe she would have understood. But since she found it out in a way that made her feel betrayed, the secrecy might have been the issue. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions, and the wife's feelings of betrayal and discomfort are valid. Even if the intention was good, the lack of transparency could be seen as a breach of trust. The focus here is on her feelings and the importance of mutual understanding in a relationship.\n"
