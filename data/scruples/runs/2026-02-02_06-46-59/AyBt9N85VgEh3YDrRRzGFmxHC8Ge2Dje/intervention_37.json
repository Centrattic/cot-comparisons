She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about his wife. The key points are that he created the almanac to remember important things about her, like her favorite things, to do sweet things for her. He hadn't shown it to anyone and kept it private. However, when his wife found out, she felt betrayed and thought he was using it as a \"playbook,\" which made her feel cheapened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to be attentive and remember details about his wife, which is a thoughtful gesture. But the wife's reaction suggests that she felt uncomfortable or even hurt by the existence of this notebook. Why might that be? Maybe she felt that if he needed to write things down, he wasn't truly remembering them from the heart. Or perhaps she felt that the notes were being used in a manipulative way to gain affection, which would explain the term \"playbook.\" \n\nTrust is a big factor here. The wife might have felt that keeping such a detailed record of her personal preferences was an invasion of her privacy or that he wasn't genuinely paying attention in the moment. Even though the husband's intent was to show love and care, the wife's perception is that he was using the notes as a strategy. This can create a sense of betrayal because she might have believed he was acting out of genuine memory and affection rather than relying on a written list.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of agency. By keeping the almanac, the husband might have made her feel like her actions or preferences were being cataloged for his benefit, which could undermine her autonomy. She might have wanted to feel that her interests were naturally part of their relationship without being reduced to notes in a book. \n\nThe husband's surprise and hurt reaction indicate that he didn't foresee this outcome. He saw the almanac as a positive attempt to be a better partner, but he didn't consider that his wife might have a different interpretation. This highlights a communication gap. He assumed that his actions were transparently kind, but he didn't discuss the purpose of the almanac with her. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual understanding are important. While the husband's actions were well-meaning, the method he chose to express his love might not have aligned with his wife's expectations. The fact that she was unaware of the almanac's existence until it was discovered adds to her feeling of betrayal, as it wasn't something they discussed. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? The question is whether his actions were inherently wrong or if there's a misunderstanding. Since his intention was positive, but the outcome caused hurt, it's more about a miscommunication and differing expectations in how love and attention should be expressed. However, the key here is whether the method of keeping the almanac crossed a line into making her feel objectified or used. \n\nIf the husband had discussed the almanac with his wife and explained his intentions, maybe she would have appreciated it. But since he kept it secret and she found out in a way that made her feel he was using it as a strategy, it's plausible that he overstepped by not being open about it. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's actions might not be malicious, but the secrecy and the way it was perceived by his wife could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, while his intention was good, the method might have been flawed, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
