She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about keeping an Almanac with personal notes about his wife. He started doing this when he was 23, wrote down things like her favorite colors, books, etc., to remember them and use them for sweet gestures. Now she found it, got upset, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is privacy and trust. The wife feels betrayed because she thought he remembered things naturally, but he was actually keeping notes. She called it a \"playbook,\" which makes her feel like he's scripting their relationship. The author didn't show it to anyone and kept it a secret, which he thought was a sweet gesture. But she's hurt and wants to destroy it.\n\nSo, why would she feel that way? Maybe she values genuine effort and memory, and the idea that he needs a notebook to remember things makes her feel like he's not truly attentive or in love. There's a difference between remembering things on purpose and being expected to remember instinctively. If he needs notes, it might suggest he's not making the effort to internalize those details, which she might see as inauthentic.\n\nAlso, the author didn't mention it to her. Even if it's a good intention, not sharing such a personal method could be a breach of trust. She might feel like he's hiding something, or that he's not being fully open about how he manages their relationship. The secrecy might be a bigger problem than the act of keeping notes itself.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to remember and show love, which is positive. Many people forget things, and using a notebook could be a way to stay connected. But the key is how his wife perceives it. If she feels like he's keeping track in a way that manipulates or insincere, then it's an issue for her. The fact that she's upset and considering destroying it shows that this is a significant emotional response.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions, while well-intentioned, crossed a boundary. Since he kept it a secret and didn't consider her feelings about his method of remembering, maybe he is in the wrong. The wife's feelings of betrayal and cheapening the gestures suggest that the way he approached it affected their relationship negatively. Even if it wasn't his intention to hurt her, he should have been more open about it and considered her perspective.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the secrecy and the perception of inauthenticity caused hurt and betrayal, even if his intentions were good.\n"
