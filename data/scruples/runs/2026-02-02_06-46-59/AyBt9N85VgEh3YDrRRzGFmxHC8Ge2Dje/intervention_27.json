She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband created this \"Almanac\" where he writes down all sorts of personal details about his wife\u2014her likes, dislikes, etc. He uses it to remember things and do sweet things for her. But when she found out, she was upset and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" that cheapened his actions. Now the question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's intention was good. He wanted to remember things because he cares, and he did it secretly, not showing anyone. He didn't think there was anything wrong with it. On the other hand, the wife felt betrayed, like he was keeping track of her in a way that made her uncomfortable. She might feel that by having a list, his gestures aren't genuine anymore but instead calculated.\n\nThe key points here are consent and transparency. Did he ask her if it was okay? He didn't, but he didn't share it with anyone else, just kept it as a personal tool. However, even if it was well-intentioned, the fact that she found out and was hurt suggests that there's an issue. The wife might need to feel that her feelings and personal details are respected in a way that doesn't feel like she's being cataloged for someone else's benefit. \n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" implies that she felt he was using her, maybe manipulating her with the knowledge he accumulated. Even though his intentions were good, the perception is important here. Trust and how each person feels about the relationship are crucial. If she feels that his actions undermine the authenticity of his gestures, then he might have overstepped, even without malice.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the problem isn't the act of noting things down but the way it was presented. If he had been more open about it, maybe she would have appreciated it. But he kept it secret, which might have led to her feeling like he wasn't honest with her. The secrecy might be the real issue here. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if something is done with good intentions, if it's done behind the partner's back, it can lead to mistrust. The wife's reaction is valid because she felt her privacy was invaded or her feelings were cheapened. The husband might not have considered how she would perceive the existence of such a document. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the husband's intentions were good, the method and secrecy might have caused harm. The answer hinges on whether the husband's actions, though well-meaning, were inconsiderate of his wife's feelings and privacy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
