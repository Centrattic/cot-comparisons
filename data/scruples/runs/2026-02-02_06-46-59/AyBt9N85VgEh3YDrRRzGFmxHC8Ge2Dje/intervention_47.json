She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having an almanac where they write down personal details about their wife. The wife found out and is upset, feeling like the almanac is a \"playbook\" and that it's cheapened the gestures. The husband didn't mean to do anything wrong; he just wanted to remember things to do sweet stuff for her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's reaction and the husband's intention. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about her. But the wife feels betrayed and that the almanac is a play for brownie points. The problem might be that he kept it a secret. Even though he didn't share it with others, the fact that he kept it hidden and used it as a tool to do nice things might make her feel like he's inauthentic. Like, maybe she values sincerity over planned gestures. \n\nThe husband might think he's being thoughtful, but she sees it as insincere because it's written down and planned. Maybe there's a communication gap. He didn't consider how she might feel about him keeping a list of her preferences. Some people might feel that their authenticity is being manipulated, even if the intent is good. So, is the husband wrong? Well, he didn't have bad intentions, but maybe he should have discussed it with her. Keeping such a personal item secret could be seen as not respecting her feelings enough. So maybe he is in the wrong because the method of showing love isn't matching her expectations. But others might argue that it's a sweet gesture. The answer depends on whether keeping the almanac without discussing it was a breach of trust, even if unintended. The wife's feelings are valid here. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
