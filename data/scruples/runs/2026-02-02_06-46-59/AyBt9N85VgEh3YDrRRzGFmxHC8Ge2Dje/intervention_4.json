She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband kept a notebook called The Almanac where he wrote down all sorts of personal details about his wife\u2014her favorite things, etc. He did this so he could remember and do sweet things for her. But when she found it, she was upset, feeling betrayed, and called it a playbook. She's considering destroying it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was good, right? He wanted to remember important things about his wife to show he cares. But the wife is upset. Why? Maybe because he kept it a secret. Even though he didn't share it with anyone, the fact that he was keeping track of her personal details without her knowing might have made her feel like her privacy was invaded. It could come off as manipulative if she saw it as a list of things to use to get her to like him more, rather than genuine remembrance.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is it about the action or the perception? The husband didn't have bad intentions, but maybe he didn't consider how his wife might feel if she found out. Trust and transparency are important in relationships. Even if the intention was good, keeping such a secret might have broken trust. The wife might feel that he was treating their relationship like something that needed a strategy, which could undermine her feelings of being genuinely loved.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband wasn't using the Almanac to manipulate; he was using it to remember. But the wife's reaction is valid. She might not have wanted her private preferences to be written down, even by someone she loves. The key here is communication. If he had talked to her about it instead of keeping it a secret, maybe she would have understood. But since he didn't, her reaction is a result of the lack of communication and the secretiveness of the action.\n\nSo, considering that the husband's action, while well-meaning, was done without his wife's knowledge or consent, leading to her feeling betrayed, it seems like he is in the wrong. The wrong isn't in the intention but in the method\u2014keeping such a personal record secret. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
