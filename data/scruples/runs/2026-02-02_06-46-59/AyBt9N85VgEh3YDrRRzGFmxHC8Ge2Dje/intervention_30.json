She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who has been keeping an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and personal details, which he uses to remember things and do sweet gestures. His wife found out, and now she's upset, feeling betrayed, and calling it a \"playbook,\" which made her feel like his gestures were insincere.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband created the Almanac out of genuine love and a desire to remember important things about his wife. He never showed it to anyone and kept it private. The wife found it, got upset, and now there's tension. The husband is confused because he thought this was a good thing.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to know my take. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's intention was good. He wanted to show his love by remembering details, which is a thoughtful gesture. Keeping notes to avoid forgetting is common, especially for important info. However, the problem arises from how his wife perceived it. She felt that having a written \"playbook\" made his actions feel inauthentic, like he was just following a script instead of genuinely caring. This could lead to her feeling that his gestures weren't sincere, which might undermine the trust and emotional connection in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: privacy and boundaries. The husband didn't tell her about the Almanac before. Even though his intention was good, not discussing it with her might have been a mistake. If she had known about it earlier, maybe she would have felt it was sweet, or maybe not. But since he didn't communicate it, her discovery led to negative feelings. Trust and communication are crucial in relationships. Keeping something like this secret, even with good intentions, could be seen as a breach of trust because it wasn't transparent.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction suggests that she values spontaneity and genuine effort over planned gestures. She might feel that the Almanac is manipulative, that he's using it to control or script their interactions, which could make her feel used or not truly loved. The fact that she's considering destroying it shows how hurt she is.\n\nBut wait, the husband didn't create the Almanac with malice. He did it out of love. The issue is more about differing expectations and communication. If the wife didn't like the idea, even if the intention was good, then maybe the husband should have discussed it with her earlier. However, the Almanac itself isn't inherently wrong. People often use reminders for important things. The problem is the wife's perception and how she feels about it now.\n\nSo, is the husband at fault? He didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but in a relationship context, not considering his partner's feelings could be a mistake. The core of the issue is about mutual understanding and consent in how they express love and care. The husband's actions, while well-meaning, didn't consider his partner's perspective on sincerity and authenticity. That lack of consideration could be seen as the wrong part here.\n\nTherefore, even though his intentions were good, the outcome was hurtful. The husband didn't communicate his actions, leading to a breach of trust from his wife's viewpoint. In relationships, transparency about such things is important. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his wife's feelings and the importance of open communication regarding such a personal matter.\n"
