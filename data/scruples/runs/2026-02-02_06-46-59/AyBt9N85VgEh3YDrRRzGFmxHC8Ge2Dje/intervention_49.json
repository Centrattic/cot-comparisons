She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person (the husband) kept an almanac of notes about his wife's preferences and memories. He did this to remember important details about her, like her favorite flowers and other things. The issue arose when his wife found out and felt that it was a \"playbook\" and felt betrayed. The user is asking if the author (husband) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember things to be romantic and thoughtful. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. But the wife's reaction is significant. She felt that having a written list of these things made her feel like her husband wasn't genuinely remembering them, but instead was just following a list. That betrayal feeling suggests that she might have felt her privacy was invaded, or that her genuine emotions were being manipulated.\n\nWhy did she react that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine effort over written reminders. Or perhaps she felt that the act of writing things down reduced the sincerity of his gestures. It could be that she didn't expect him to have a system like that and it made her uncomfortable. The fact that she called it a \"playbook\" implies she thought he was using it to get points, even if that wasn't his intention.\n\nThe husband's actions were well-meaning, but the outcome was hurt feelings. The question is whether the act itself was wrong. Since he had no malicious intent and kept it private, it's more about a mismatch in expectations. However, in relationships, transparency is important. If the husband had shared his intentions earlier, maybe her reaction would have been different. But since he didn't and she felt betrayed, maybe there's a lesson here about communication. The husband might be in the wrong not because the act was inherently bad, but because it wasn't discussed and it made her feel a certain way despite his good intentions.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that keeping notes is a good way to remember things and that the wife overreacted. But the key point is that the wife felt hurt, and the husband's failure to consider her perspective led to that hurt. So even if the action wasn't malicious, the impact on her feelings matters.\n"
