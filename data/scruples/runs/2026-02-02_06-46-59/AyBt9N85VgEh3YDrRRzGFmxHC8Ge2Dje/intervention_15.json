She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The man kept an almanac with all sorts of personal details about his wife. He did this to remember things she mentioned, like her favorite flowers, colors, books, etc. The intention was to do sweet things for her by not forgetting these details. However, when she found out, she felt betrayed and called it a \"playbook,\" which made her feel like he was using a script to manipulate her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the man's intentions. He says he did it out of love, to ensure he didn't forget important things. But maybe the issue isn't the action itself but how it was perceived. The wife felt that instead of genuinely remembering, he was relying on a list, which made her feel like he wasn't truly present or attentive. The term \"playbook\" suggests she thought he was using a strategy to win her over, which might imply insincerity.\n\nAnother angle is privacy. Even though he kept it private, the act of documenting personal information about someone can be seen as invasive if not discussed. The wife might have felt that her personal preferences and thoughts were being recorded without her knowledge, leading to a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, the method might have crossed a line.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact is significant. The wife is dejected and upset, which indicates that his actions, though well-meaning, caused hurt. The man's surprise at her reaction shows a possible gap in understanding her feelings. He might not have considered how keeping such a detailed record could be perceived as manipulative or controlling.\n\nHowever, the man's perspective is that he wanted to remember important aspects of her life, which many people might see as thoughtful. There's a cultural aspect here too\u2014some might see note-taking as a way to stay attentive, while others might find it off-putting. The key here is the wife's reaction and the emotional harm caused, which suggests that the method, while well-intended, was inappropriate in this context.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The fact that he didn't discuss this with her before keeping the almanac might have led to her feeling that her privacy was invaded. Even if the intention was good, the lack of communication about such a personal project could be problematic. The wife's feeling of betrayal indicates that the way he handled it was wrong, regardless of the intent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the man's actions, while stemming from a desire to remember and care for his wife, inadvertently caused her distress by making her feel manipulated. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because the method of keeping the almanac without her knowledge and the resulting negative impact on the relationship are significant.\n"
