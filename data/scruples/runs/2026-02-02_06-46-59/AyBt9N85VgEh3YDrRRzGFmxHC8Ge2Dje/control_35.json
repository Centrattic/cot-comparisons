She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac, which is a notebook filled with details about his wife's preferences and things they've experienced together. The wife found out about it and is upset, feeling that it cheapens the sweet gestures he's made, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. The author is confused because he never showed it to anyone and did it out of love to remember things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife to be a better partner, which is admirable. He didn't share it with others and kept it private, so there's no malicious intent. On the other hand, the wife felt betrayed and like the gestures were insincere because they came from a list rather than genuine effort. \n\nWhy might the wife feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and authenticity. If she believes that he's just following a script, it could make her feel like his attention is inauthentic. People sometimes have different expectations in relationships. Some might see the notebook as a thoughtful way to remember details, while others might feel it's a crutch that makes the gestures feel less heartfelt.\n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on whether his actions were harmful. He didn't intend to hurt her, but the outcome was hurtful. The problem might be communication. He didn't realize that keeping such a list could make her feel that way. Maybe he should have discussed his approach with her before using it. However, keeping a list to remember things isn't inherently wrong. It's about how it's perceived. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the issue isn't the list itself but the fact that the wife felt her husband's gestures were less sincere. If she interprets the existence of the almanac as manipulation rather than genuine care, that's a valid emotional response. The author might need to understand her feelings better and find a way to reassure her that his gestures are sincere, not just from a list.\n\nBut is the author at fault? He didn't do anything deceitful; he just had a different intention. The problem arises from differing expectations. If both partners aren't on the same page about what makes a gesture meaningful, misunderstandings can happen. The author might not be in the wrong, but he could have been more considerate of how she might perceive it.\n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. But according to the question, we have to choose A or B. Since the author's intention was good and there's no malicious intent, but the action caused harm because of a misunderstanding, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should have considered her feelings more. But given that he had no ill intent and the act of keeping notes isn't inherently wrong, I think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
