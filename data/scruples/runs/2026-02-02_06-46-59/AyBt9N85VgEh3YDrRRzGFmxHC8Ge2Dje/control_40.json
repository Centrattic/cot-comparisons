She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping an almanac of personal details about his wife. He created it to remember things he loves about her, but she found out and feels betrayed, calling it a playbook that cheapens his gestures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband started writing down things about his wife because he wanted to remember them and do sweet things. He never shared it with anyone. The wife found the almanac and felt hurt, thinking he was treating their relationship like a script. The husband is confused because he meant it as a genuine expression of love.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he had good intentions. He wanted to show he cared by remembering details. But maybe the problem is that he kept it secret. The wife might have felt that he was keeping track for manipulative reasons, not realizing that he was just trying to be thoughtful. Trust is important in relationships. If he didn't discuss this with her before, she might not have known his intentions. Even though his motives were good, the secrecy and the way she perceived it (as a playbook) could be an issue. However, it's possible that the wife is overreacting because she misunderstood his purpose. The husband didn't lie about it, just didn't discuss it. \n\nThe question is whether his actions crossed a line. The answer might depend on cultural expectations. Some people might see keeping such a journal as sweet and thoughtful, while others see it as invasive or insincere. Since the wife is hurt, the husband's intentions aside, her feelings are valid. He should have communicated better. Maybe he should have talked to her about why he was keeping the almanac instead of keeping it a secret. But does that make him in the wrong? If he had the best intentions, maybe not. However, if the secrecy made her feel like he was being inauthentic, then he might be at fault for not being transparent. \n\nSo, in AITA terms, people often consider both intentions and the impact. The husband's intentions are good, but the impact was negative. Whether he's \"in the wrong\" could depend on whether the secrecy and lack of communication were the main issues. If the wife felt betrayed because he didn't share his reasons with her, then he's partly responsible. Alternatively, if she's being overly sensitive, maybe not. But since the story is from his perspective and he's asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards no because his intentions were good, but he should have been more open. However, some might argue that keeping such a personal document without discussing it could be seen as manipulative, even if unintended. \n\nI think the key here is that the husband didn't mean harm, but the action of keeping a secret document might have made the wife feel like his gestures were calculated rather than genuine. Even if they are genuine, the way it was presented (through a hidden almanac) might have undermined her trust. Therefore, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his intentions properly, leading to misunderstanding. But others might say it's not his fault because he had good intentions. It's a bit of a grey area. In AITA forums, often the answer hinges on whether the action was malicious or not. Since it wasn't, and the husband is genuinely trying to be a good partner, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that she felt betrayed because of the secrecy might mean he did do something wrong. Hmm.\n"
