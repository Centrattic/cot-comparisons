She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac with personal notes about his wife. The story is about a guy who started writing down details about his wife's preferences to remember them and do sweet things for her. His wife found the notebook, felt betrayed, and now he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to figure out the key points here. The husband's intention was to remember things he loves about his wife, which is a good sign. But the wife's reaction is negative, interpreting the notes as a \"playbook\" that cheapens his efforts. She feels like he's using a script instead of genuinely caring.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is wrong for keeping these notes. On one hand, he meant well, and the act of wanting to remember important things about his partner is thoughtful. On the other hand, the wife's feelings are valid. Maybe the issue is about transparency and how personal information is handled. Did he keep it a secret? The wife didn't know about the notebook until she found it, which might have made her feel like he was keeping secrets or manipulating her emotions in a way she didn't appreciate.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of intimacy. The husband might have thought that keeping notes was a personal way to show love, but the wife saw it as inauthentic. Some people value spontaneity and genuine effort over planned gestures, even if the latter are well-intentioned. The fact that the wife called it a \"playbook\" suggests she felt like his actions were rehearsed or strategic rather than heartfelt.\n\nBut then again, isn't the intention behind the actions what matters? The husband didn't do it to be manipulative; he wanted to remember her preferences to make her happy. However, the wife's reaction is about how she felt, which is a key part of any relationship. Trust and comfort are important. If she felt like he was keeping secrets or treating their relationship as something to be managed with a list, that could damage trust.\n\nAlso, the secrecy around the notebook is a point. He never told anyone about it, not even his wife. Even though it's a personal journal, maybe the fact that he didn't share it with her implies a lack of openness. In relationships, sharing important parts of oneself is crucial. If he kept it hidden, she might feel like he's holding something back, even if it's meant to be a private love letter to her.\n\nSo, balancing the intention vs. the impact. The husband's intention was good, but the impact on his wife was negative. In relationships, both intention and impact matter. Even if you didn't mean to hurt someone, if your actions caused them pain, it's important to consider that you might have done something wrong. \n\nBut then again, is keeping a personal journal inherently wrong? People often keep diaries or notes for personal reflection. The problem here is the wife's reaction. It's possible she has trust issues or a different perspective on how love is expressed. Maybe she felt that the notes made her feel objectified or that her preferences were being cataloged rather than genuinely remembered and acted upon from within.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the husband isn't in the wrong because his intention was good, but he might need to adjust his approach by being more open and understanding his wife's feelings. However, since the question is whether he is in the wrong (A) or not (B), I have to decide based on the scenario. Since the wife's feelings are valid and the secrecy could be a breach of trust, even if unintended, the husband might be partially at fault. But if the focus is on his intention, then maybe not. \n\nBut in relationship advice contexts, usually, both perspectives are considered. The husband's actions were well-meaning, but he didn't consider how his wife would feel upon finding it. So, he's not entirely at fault, but he needs to address her feelings. The answer would likely be B, he's not in the wrong, but he needs to work on communication. However, some might argue that keeping secrets, even with good intentions, is wrong. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were genuinely problematic. Since the husband didn't intend harm and the wife's reaction is about her personal feelings, it's possible the husband isn't the asshole. So the answer would be B.\n"
