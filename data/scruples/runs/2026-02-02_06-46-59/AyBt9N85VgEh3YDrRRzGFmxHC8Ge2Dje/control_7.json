She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for having an almanac of his wife's preferences and such. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe husband started writing down things his wife mentioned, like favorite colors, restaurants, books, etc., in a notebook called The Almanac. He used it to remember things so he could do sweet things for her. He never showed it to anyone, kept it private. Now the wife found it, called it a \"playbook,\" felt betrayed, and thinks it cheapens the sweet things he's done. She's upset, he's heartbroken, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether his action of keeping the almanac was wrong. Let's break down possible angles. \n\nFirst, intention vs. perception. The husband's intention was to remember things he cares about, which is a positive intent. He didn't want to be the guy who forgets, which shows he values his wife's preferences. But the wife's reaction is negative. She felt betrayed and saw it as a playbook, implying that he was using it strategically, maybe manipulatively. \n\nIs the act of keeping notes inherently wrong? If the husband didn't share it and it's his way of keeping track, maybe he's not at fault. But maybe there's an issue of privacy or trust. The wife didn't know about it, and the fact that he kept it a secret could be a problem. Even if his intentions were good, did he overstep by keeping such detailed records without discussing it with her?\n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" suggests that she thought he was using it to manipulate her or to have an advantage, like in a game. That's a big deal because it can make her feel like her feelings are being used rather than genuinely appreciated. \n\nSo even though the husband's intention was good, the way it made his wife feel is critical. The problem here is communication. He didn't talk to her about why he was keeping the almanac, so she didn't have a chance to understand his perspective. If he had been open about it, maybe she would have appreciated it more. But since she found out in this way, it's causing hurt feelings.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but in terms of relationship dynamics, maybe. He should have considered her feelings and discussed his reasons for keeping the almanac. Keeping things so secret that they cause hurt upon discovery can be a problem, even if the motive is good. So maybe he's not in the wrong in a strict sense, but he could have handled it differently. But according to the question, the options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nThe answer depends on whether the secrecy and the effect on her feelings make him wrong. Since the intention was good but the execution caused harm, it's a gray area. In relationships, actions that make the other person feel disrespected or manipulated are usually problematic. If she feels like it's a playbook, then maybe he was wrong to not be transparent. Therefore, B might be the answer because the intention wasn't malicious, but maybe A if the action itself is considered wrong regardless of intent. But I think the key here is that he's not being malicious, just perhaps unaware of how it's perceived. So the answer might be B.\n"
