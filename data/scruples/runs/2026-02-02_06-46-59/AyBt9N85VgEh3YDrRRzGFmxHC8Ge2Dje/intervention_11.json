She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Almanac) is in the wrong. The story is about a guy who started keeping a journal of his wife's preferences and personal details to remember them and do sweet things for her. But now his wife is upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling betrayed. The author is confused because he thought he was showing love by remembering these things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good\u2014to remember important things about his wife. He didn't share the journal with anyone, so he probably thought it was a private, loving gesture. But the wife's reaction is negative, feeling like it's insincere or manipulative. Maybe she felt it wasn't genuine because he relied on notes instead of naturally remembering, or perhaps she felt it was a strategy to impress her, which made her uncomfortable. \n\nThe key here is the wife's feelings. The author might not have realized that keeping a written list could make the wife feel like his actions weren't heartfelt. Love and thoughtfulness can be subjective. What one person sees as a sweet effort, another might see as a calculated move. The author might be in the wrong if his actions, though well-intentioned, caused emotional distress. But then again, if he had no malicious intent and it was just a misunderstanding, maybe it's not his fault entirely.\n\nHowever, in relationships, transparency and communication are important. If the author had asked his wife about her feelings towards his method of remembering things, he might have avoided this conflict. By keeping it a secret, even if well-intentioned, he might have overstepped without considering her perspective. So maybe the issue is that he didn't communicate his intentions and now the wife feels like he's been using a playbook rather than being genuinely attentive.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping notes isn't inherently wrong. Many people use reminders for important dates or preferences. But the term \"playbook\" suggests she sees it as a list of strategies to manipulate her, which could be hurtful. The author's confusion is valid because he didn't mean to hurt her, but the impact is there. The question is whether the author should have anticipated that keeping such a list might make her uncomfortable. \n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions, though well-meaning, were inappropriate due to not respecting the wife's feelings or expectations about how love gestures should be given. If the wife values spontaneity and genuine memory over written notes, then the author might be in the wrong by not aligning with her preferences. Alternatively, if the author's method was a personal way to show love and didn't intend any harm, it's a misunderstanding rather than a wrongdoing. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author likely didn't have malicious intent, but he did create a situation where his wife felt manipulated. Since the impact matters in these situations, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings about how he was showing love. The answer could be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions, though good-intentioned, led to her feeling betrayed, and maybe he should have communicated better. However, if the focus is on his lack of intent, it could be B. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not just the outcome. So the answer might be A.\n"
