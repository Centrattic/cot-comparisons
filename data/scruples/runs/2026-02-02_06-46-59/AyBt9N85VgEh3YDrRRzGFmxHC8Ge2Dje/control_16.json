She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy created an Almanac with all sorts of personal details about his wife, like her favorite things, and he used it to remember stuff to do sweet things for her. But when his wife found out, she felt betrayed and thought it was a \"playbook,\" making her feel like he wasn't genuine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why the wife is upset. She might feel that keeping a list of her preferences is inauthentic. Like, instead of just remembering things naturally because he cares, he's using a playbook to manipulate or perform. That could make her feel like his actions are calculated rather than heartfelt. But on the other hand, the author's intention was to remember things because he loves her and doesn't want to forget. He didn't show it to anyone else, so maybe his motives are pure.\n\nBut why does she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory over written notes. If he's writing things down, she might think he doesn't trust himself to remember, or that he's only doing it to earn points. It's possible that she feels his actions are insincere because they're based on a list rather than from the heart. Even if his intention is good, the perception is that he's using a strategy, which can feel like a betrayal of trust or authenticity.\n\nAnother angle: privacy. The wife might feel that by writing down personal details, he's reducing her to a list of preferences. It's like he's cataloging her for convenience rather than appreciating her as a person. Even though it's meant to be loving, the act of documenting might make her feel objectified or that her personal information isn't private. She might have expected that her preferences would be remembered through natural interaction, not through a written record.\n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" suggests she sees it as a strategy, maybe something used to gain an advantage in a relationship, which can imply manipulation. Even if it's not the case, the term itself has a negative connotation, like he's scripting his behavior. This could lead to her feeling like he's not being genuine in his affection.\n\nHowever, the author argues that he's trying to be attentive, which he is. He's making an effort to remember things because he loves her. The problem is the method he chose. The key here is communication. He didn't discuss this with her before creating the Almanac, so she might not have been aware of his intentions. If he had explained that he uses the notebook to help him remember because he cares, maybe she would have a different view. But since she found out this way, her reaction is based on her own interpretation without context.\n\nIn relationships, trust and transparency are crucial. Even if the action itself isn't wrong, the lack of discussion about it might contribute to her feeling hurt. She might have felt that sharing personal information meant she trusted him to remember, not that he would write it down. The act of keeping a record could be seen as a breach of that trust, even if unintended.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. His intentions are good, but the action might have been insensitive to her feelings about privacy and authenticity. The wife's reaction is valid because she feels betrayed, even if the author didn't mean to hurt her. The right answer here is probably \"B\" (No, he's not in the wrong) because his intentions are positive and he didn't have malicious intent, but I'm a bit conflicted. However, considering that the wife's feelings are valid and the situation is about perception, maybe the answer is \"A\" (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the method he used caused harm even if the intent was good. Wait, but the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the harm was unintended but the action still caused hurt, does that make him wrong? It depends on cultural or personal norms.\n\nIn some perspectives, the act of keeping a list is okay if it's for good purposes. But in relationships, actions that make a partner feel objectified or insincere can be problematic. Since the wife feels betrayed and the action led to her distress, even if unintended, the author might be in the wrong. But maybe not, because he didn't mean to hurt her. It's tricky. The answer could be either, but based on the question's structure, maybe the answer is B (No), because the author's intentions were good, and the fault is more on the wife's perception. Alternatively, since the action caused harm, maybe A. Hmm. I think the answer is B because the author didn't have bad intentions and it's a misunderstanding. The wife's feelings are valid, but the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
