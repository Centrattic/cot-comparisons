She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author met his wife in 2008, and she worked in a dirty restaurant, but he fell in love. To remember her likes and things she mentioned, he started a notebook called The Almanac. He wrote down her favorite color, restaurants, books, movies, etc. He used it to recall these details to do sweet things for her. Recently, his wife found the notebook and is upset, saying it cheapens the sweet gestures and calling it a \"playbook\" which made her feel betrayed. The author is confused because he didn't show it to anyone and thought it was a good way to remember things. Now he's worried she might destroy it and he's getting the silent treatment. The question is whether he's in the wrong, with A being yes and B no.\n\nHmm. So the author's intention was to remember his wife's preferences to be a better partner, but his wife felt betrayed even though he kept it private. Let me think about possible angles. \n\nFirst, the act of keeping a notebook with personal details about someone. Is that inherently wrong? Well, sometimes people might find it creepy if it's not their intent, but in this case, the author's goal was to remember things to be considerate. But the wife's reaction suggests she felt like he was using the notes as a tool, a \"playbook,\" to manipulate or perform sweetness, which might imply insincerity. She might feel that the gestures are not from his heart but from a list, which could make them feel less genuine. That's a common issue in relationships where one partner feels like the other is not truly engaged but just following a script.\n\nAnother angle: privacy and consent. Did he have any reason not to keep this private? The wife didn't know about it, so it's a question of whether he should have discussed it with her. Maybe she values spontaneity and the idea that he's memorizing things for her might make her uncomfortable. If he had explained his reasoning before she found out, maybe it would have been different. But since he didn't, she might feel like he kept a secret that's significant. However, the author didn't hide it in a malicious way; he just didn't mention it because he thought it was a personal thing. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is strong\u2014calling it a betrayal. That's a big word. It could be because she feels like the notes make her feel like an object, something to be cataloged rather than a person he's genuinely connected with. Even if his intention was good, the perception is that he's using a list, which might not align with her feelings of being loved authentically. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be a good husband by remembering her preferences. He didn't lie about it, just hadn't discussed it. Maybe the wife's expectations were different. She might have thought that he truly remembered the things she told him without needing a reference, and having a notebook makes her feel like he's not retaining the information in a heartfelt way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, it's a matter of perspective. He didn't have bad intentions, but maybe he overlooked how his wife might feel about it. The key points here are intent vs. perception. He meant well, but the act of keeping a notebook that she found out about and which she perceives as insincere or manipulative might have caused hurt even if unintended. In relationships, communication is key. If something is important to one's partner, even if it's a personal habit, maybe it's better to discuss it. But since he did this secretly, even if for a good reason, the fact that he didn't share this with her might be the issue. \n\nAlternatively, some people might see it as a thoughtful way to remember things, and the wife is overreacting. But given that the wife is now feeling betrayed, it's a significant emotional response. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intentions, but in terms of how it made his wife feel, he could have been more considerate of her feelings about privacy and authenticity. \n\nI think the answer here is A, yes, the author is in the wrong. Not because the act of keeping notes is bad, but because he didn't consider how his wife might perceive it. Even if it was for a good reason, the lack of transparency led to her feeling betrayed. In a relationship, actions that affect the partner should ideally be discussed, especially if they're about personal, intimate information. The wife's reaction is valid, and the author should have been more open about his method of remembering things. So the answer would be A.\n"
