She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac of their wife's preferences and memories. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author started the Almanac as a personal notebook to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite flowers, colors, etc. The intention was to remember things to do sweet things for her. He never showed it to anyone or mentioned it, so he thought it was a private, personal record of his love and effort.\n\nNow, the wife found the Almanac and reacted negatively, saying it cheapened the sweet gestures and called it a \"playbook,\" feeling like he was using it to manipulate her. The author is heartbroken and confused because he didn't mean it that way. The key points here are the author's intent versus the wife's perception.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, keeping a personal notebook to remember things about someone isn't inherently wrong. However, the issue arises from the wife's feelings of betrayal and feeling that her gestures are being used as a strategy. The author didn't have any malicious intent, but the action of keeping a \"playbook\" might have made her feel like her love is being commodified or used as part of a game.\n\nIn relationships, transparency and mutual understanding are important. The author didn't hide the existence of the notebook, but he also didn't discuss it with her. Maybe she felt that such personal information should be shared naturally without being documented. Her reaction suggests that she values spontaneity and genuine memory over recorded notes. The author's actions, though well-meaning, might have crossed a line in her eyes by making her feel like every gesture is part of a rehearsed plan.\n\nBut is that the author's fault? He didn't set out to hurt her; he just wanted to remember. However, the problem is that his method of remembering made her feel uneasy. The question is whether the method of using a notebook was wrong. If the intention was good, but the effect was harmful, does that make the action wrong? It's a matter of perspective. The author might argue he's trying to be a better partner, while the wife feels it's inauthentic.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the actions were wrong given both sides. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical in a strict sense, but the emotional impact is significant. The answer might depend on whether the wife's feelings are valid. Since the wife is in distress and the author is trying to understand why, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong, but he needs to understand her perspective and adjust his approach in the future.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he needs to address her feelings and perhaps find another way to remember things without making her feel used.\n"
