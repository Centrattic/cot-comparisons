She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal details about his wife. \n\nFirst, the author created the almanac to remember important things about his wife, like her favorite things and personal preferences. His intention was to make sure he didn't forget and to do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone, and he wrote it himself. \n\nBut his wife found it, and she's upset. She feels that the almanac has cheapened his gestures because she thought he remembered these things naturally, not from a list. She refers to it as a \"playbook\" and feels betrayed. Now she's considering destroying it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about intent versus perception. The author's intention was purely to show love and remember important details. However, his wife's reaction is based on how she perceived it. She felt that using a written list made the gestures less sincere, as if he was just following a script. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's doing something thoughtful to avoid being the kind of husband who forgets important things. From the wife's perspective, the existence of the list made her feel like her partner wasn't genuine in remembering her preferences from the heart. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, keeping notes to remember things isn't inherently wrong. However, the issue arises from the wife's feelings of betrayal and the sense that her partner wasn't truly present or genuine in remembering her. The author didn't have any malicious intent, but the act of keeping the almanac might have undermined the wife's feelings of being loved and remembered without the need for external tools. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't realize that his method of remembering could be perceived negatively. It's possible that if he had discussed the almanac with his wife, she might have understood his intentions. But since he kept it secret, her discovery led to hurt feelings. \n\nSo, while the author's actions were well-meaning, the lack of communication and the wife's subsequent feelings of being betrayed point to the fact that he might be at fault. However, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't malicious, but the outcome is that his wife feels hurt. In such cases, the responsibility isn't entirely on one side. \n\nBut according to the question, we need to choose between A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No, he's not). Considering the wife's perspective and the emotional impact, even if unintended, the author's actions led to her feeling betrayed. So, the answer might lean towards A. However, some might argue that his intentions were good, so he's not in the wrong. But the key is that his actions caused harm, even if unintentionally. In many ethical frameworks, intent matters, but the outcome is also important. If the wife's feelings are valid, then the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider how his actions might be perceived. \n\nAlternatively, some might say that keeping notes is a personal choice and not inherently wrong. The problem is in the wife's reaction, not the act itself. But since the question is about the author being in the wrong, and the wife's reaction is based on the almanac's existence, the author's action (keeping the almanac) led to the problem. So, there's a case to be made for A. However, others might say the author isn't in the wrong because his intentions were good. \n\nThis is a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about relationships. In some views, being honest and open is crucial, and keeping such a list, even with good intentions, could be seen as insincere. In others, it's just a tool for remembering, and the wife's reaction is overblown. \n\nGiven that the wife feels betrayed and the author didn't communicate his reasoning, it's possible that the author's lack of transparency is part of the issue. Therefore, the answer could be A. However, if we consider that the author had no malicious intent and the wife's reaction is about perception, it's a gray area. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife's feelings are valid, and the author didn't consider her perspective, the answer might be A. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe B because the intent was good. Hmm.\n"
