She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this Almanac is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user met their wife in 2008 and started writing down details about her like favorite colors, restaurants, books, etc. in a notebook called The Almanac. The purpose was to remember things so they could do sweet things for her. The wife found the Almanac and now feels betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" and that everything the husband did was planned, which cheapened the gestures. The husband is confused because he didn't share the notebook with anyone and thought it was a way to show his love by remembering important stuff. They're now having issues because of this.\n\nSo the question is, is the husband in the wrong? A or B?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband's intention was good: he wanted to remember things to be thoughtful. But the wife's reaction is negative. Why? She might feel that the notes make the gestures insincere. If she believes he's just following a playbook, it might make her feel like his actions aren't genuine. Maybe she values spontaneous, heartfelt actions that come from the heart without planning. The husband, on the other hand, didn't mean to be insincere; he just wanted to remember things he would otherwise forget. But the existence of the notebook might have made her feel like he's manipulating the situation.\n\nIs the problem the notebook itself or the way it's perceived? The husband didn't share it with anyone, so maybe the wife's finding it was unexpected. Maybe she felt it was an invasion of privacy or that he was keeping secrets. Or maybe she resents that he felt the need to document everything, implying he can't remember things naturally. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes the effort is appreciated, but the method can be a problem. If she feels the gestures are less meaningful because they're planned, that's a valid feeling. The husband might not have considered that perspective. Even though his intention was good, the outcome is negative. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but he might need to understand her feelings better. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't consider how she might react to the notebook's existence, even if it was meant well.\n\nAnother angle: keeping a secret notebook about her. Even if it's for good reasons, maybe she didn't know about it and found it without being told. The fact that he didn't share it with her might have been an issue. If he had told her about it earlier, maybe she wouldn't have felt betrayed. But he didn't, so now she's upset. So maybe he's in the wrong for not being transparent about the notebook's existence, even if he didn't have bad intentions.\n\nBut then again, he didn't hide it from others or use it in a deceptive way. It was just a personal way of remembering things. The problem is that she found it and interpreted it as a playbook. So the issue is her perception, but does that make him wrong? If his actions, though well-intentioned, are causing her pain, maybe he's at fault for not considering her feelings. But maybe she's overreacting and he's not wrong.\n\nI think this is a common relationship issue where one person's way of showing love is different from the other's expectations. The husband's way is to document and plan, the wife's way is to have spontaneous gestures. The notebook itself isn't inherently wrong, but the wife's reaction is valid. The husband might need to adjust his approach, but whether he's in the wrong depends on whose perspective we take. If the question is about whether he did something wrong, maybe he's not in the wrong because his intentions were good, but he might need to address her feelings. However, if the act of keeping the notebook without her knowledge is considered a breach of trust, then he could be in the wrong. But the notebook was a personal thing, not something malicious. \n\nIn AITA posts, usually, if the person's actions, though well-meaning, cause distress, they might be considered \"not the asker\" but it depends. The key is whether the action itself is wrong, not just the intention. Here, the action is keeping a notebook. It's not inherently wrong. The problem is the wife's interpretation. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but he needs to communicate better with her. Alternatively, maybe A if the notebook's existence is seen as manipulative. But I think the more likely answer is B, he's not in the wrong because his intentions were good, even if the outcome was negative. But maybe some people would argue that the method (using a playbook) undermines sincerity, which could be seen as A. But I'm leaning towards B because the intention wasn't malicious.\n"
