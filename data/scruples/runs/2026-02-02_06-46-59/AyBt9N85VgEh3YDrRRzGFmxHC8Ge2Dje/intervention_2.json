She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac with personal notes about his wife. From the story, he started writing down her preferences, like favorite things, to remember them and do sweet things for her. He never intended to use it as a playbook but to keep track so he wouldn't forget. The issue came up when his wife found it, and she felt betrayed, thinking it was a playbook, which made her feel cheapened.\n\nSo the key points are: His intention was good, to show love and remember her details. He kept it private, never showed anyone. But the wife's reaction is negative, feeling like he's using a script, which made her feel unappreciated. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions were well-meaning, but maybe the wife felt that having a list of things to do for her made her feel like he wasn't doing it spontaneously or genuinely. Maybe she preferred that he remember things naturally without needing to refer to notes. The problem here is the wife's feelings being hurt, even if the intent was good. In relationships, how others perceive your actions matters a lot. If the wife feels betrayed or that her emotions are being manipulated, then the author might be in the wrong unintentionally. However, if the author didn't have bad intentions, then maybe it's a misunderstanding. \n\nBut the issue might be about trust. The almanac, while created with good intent, was kept secret. The wife might have felt that keeping such a detailed list was a form of control or insincere. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the wife's reaction suggests that the method of keeping the notes was problematic. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong because the action, regardless of intent, caused hurt. Alternatively, if the wife's reaction is overblown without valid reason, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, since the wife's feelings are valid, the author might need to address her concerns rather than just his own perspective. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the focus is on the impact of the action, not just the intent. So even if the author had good intentions, the wife's hurt feelings mean he's at least partially responsible. But does that make him in the wrong? If he's not keeping secrets for manipulative reasons, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that she felt that way means he should have considered her perspective. Maybe the problem is that he didn't communicate his reasons, leading to misunderstanding. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author's action, though well-intentioned, was wrong because it caused harm. If the harm is significant, then he might be at fault. But since he didn't have malicious intent, maybe it's not his fault. But in relationships, intentions don't always matter as much as the perception. So maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't consider how she might feel about the almanac being a \"playbook.\"\n"
