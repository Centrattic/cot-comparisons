She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author met his wife in 2008, and over the years, he started keeping a notebook called The Almanac where he writes down personal details about her\u2014her favorite things, interests, etc. He uses it to remember things so he can do sweet things for her. Recently, his wife found the notebook, got upset, and now he's wondering if he did something wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are that the author was keeping a personal record of his wife's preferences. He did this without her knowledge, intending to use it to remember things and show his love. But she found out and feels betrayed, seeing it as a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine expression of love. She's upset that he kept something like that secret and might even destroy it.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intention was to show love and care by remembering her preferences. He didn't share it with anyone, so it's private. But on the other hand, keeping a secret like this might have made his wife feel like her personal information was being stored without her consent. Maybe she felt it was an invasion of privacy or that he was being manipulative by using a list to get her to like him.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the intention is good, if one partner does something that the other partner finds intrusive or makes them uncomfortable, there's room for discussion. The wife's reaction suggests that she values authenticity and spontaneity in his actions. If she felt like every sweet gesture was planned using a playbook, that could undermine her trust and make her feel like he's not being genuine.\n\nBut the author might argue that he was just trying to remember things because he loves her and wants to avoid being the type of husband who forgets important details. However, the method he used might be the issue. Maybe he should have discussed his approach with her, ensuring that she was comfortable with how he was showing his love. Keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge could be seen as overstepping, even if the intention was good.\n\nAnother angle is about consent and privacy. Even in a relationship, individuals have a right to their privacy. The fact that he wrote down personal information about her, even if it's all positive, might be crossing a line. It's possible she didn't expect him to collect and store such information, which could make her feel like she's being cataloged rather than being appreciated organically.\n\nHowever, some people might see this as a thoughtful gesture. The author is making an effort to remember important things about his wife, which is a sign of commitment. The problem arises when the wife feels that this effort is insincere or manipulative. The key here is whether the method of keeping the Almanac was appropriate without her knowledge.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife feels betrayed and the action caused harm in their relationship, then the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings about privacy. But if the intention was pure and the wife is overreacting, then maybe not. However, since the wife is the one who's upset and the action led to conflict, the author might need to take responsibility for not discussing his approach with her.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though his intentions were good, he didn't consider her perspective and kept something secret that made her feel uncomfortable. The act of keeping the Almanac without her knowledge and consent could be seen as a breach of trust, leading to her feeling betrayed. The author should have communicated his actions to ensure they aligned with her comfort level.\n"
