She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the story is about a guy who kept an Almanac, a notebook with all sorts of personal details about his wife, like her favorite things. He did this because he wanted to remember them and do sweet things for her. But she found it and now feels betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" instead of a genuine act of love.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about privacy and intentions. The author didn't tell anyone about the Almanac and kept it secret. His intention was to remember his wife's preferences to show his love. However, the wife felt that it made her feel like her partner wasn't truly remembering her, but instead was using a playbook. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Well, intentions matter. He didn't mean to be insincere; he was trying to be a considerate partner. But the problem is that the existence of the notebook made his wife feel like the gestures were inauthentic. That's a conflict between his approach and her emotional response. \n\nAlso, the wife found the notebook without him knowing, which might have breached his expectation of privacy. But maybe she had a right to find it since it's their shared life. The author didn't lie about it when she asked, so he was honest once she found out. \n\nIs keeping a notebook of personal info unethical? It depends on the relationship dynamics. If the wife didn't know about it and it made her uncomfortable, then maybe the author should have considered sharing that aspect of his approach. But he did it with good intentions. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the author had no malicious intent and was trying to be loving, but the outcome was hurtful, maybe it's more about communication. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't do anything deceitful beyond keeping it secret, and the wife's reaction is about feeling insincere, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (No), but I should check if there's a cultural or ethical norm where keeping such a notebook is considered wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people appreciate when partners make efforts to remember their likes, even if it's written down. However, the wife's perspective is valid because she feels it's a manipulative tactic. But unless there was an agreement about privacy or trust issues, the author's actions might not be in the wrong. So, the answer is probably B.\n"
