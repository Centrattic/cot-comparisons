She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac of information about his wife. The story details how he started taking notes on her preferences and interests to remember them, which he compiled into a notebook called \"The Almanac.\" His wife discovered it and is upset, feeling betrayed and saying it's a \"playbook\" that cheapens his gestures. Now the author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband's intention was to remember his wife's likes and do sweet things for her by documenting them. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. However, the wife's reaction is key here. She felt that the existence of the notebook made her feel like he was only doing nice things from a script, not from genuine memory or love. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, keeping notes to remember important things about a partner isn't inherently wrong. People have different ways of showing love\u2014some might remember details naturally, others might need to write them down. The husband's actions were motivated by love and the desire to make his wife feel appreciated. \n\nHowever, the wife's feelings of betrayal and the fact that she's considering destroying the notebook are important. The issue here might be about transparency and consent. Even though the husband didn't intend to deceive, the wife might have felt that the existence of the notebook was a form of manipulation or a lack of genuine connection. In relationships, trust and mutual understanding are crucial. If the wife didn't feel comfortable with this method, even if it was well-intentioned, it might be a point of contention.\n\nAnother angle is the perception of the notebook as a \"playbook.\" The wife might feel that it reduces her to a list of preferences, making her feel objectified or that her husband's affection is insincere. That could lead to feelings of betrayal because it might seem like he's going through the motions rather than being genuinely attentive.\n\nBut the husband's intention was pure. He wanted to remember things he might forget. The problem arises from the wife's interpretation. In such cases, communication is key. The husband might not have considered how his wife would react to discovering the notebook. Even if well-meaning, it's possible that the method of remembering wasn't aligned with his wife's expectations of how love should be expressed.\n\nSo, is the husband at fault? It's a nuanced situation. While his actions were not malicious, the lack of discussion about this practice could be seen as a failure to consider his wife's feelings. The wife might have preferred that he remembered things organically rather than relying on notes, leading her to feel that the gestures are less genuine.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on intentions versus perceptions. The husband's intention was good, but the wife's feelings have been hurt. The community often looks at both sides, but in this case, the husband might not be \"in the wrong\" because his actions weren't deceptive or harmful, but he might have failed to consider his wife's perspective. However, since the wife is upset and the situation is causing tension, the answer might hinge on whether the method of remembering is acceptable in the relationship.\n\nGiven the options, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the husband's actions were motivated by love and the intention to remember important things. However, there's room for argument that he should have considered how she'd react. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and there's no indication of malicious intent or breaking of trust beyond the method itself, the answer is B.\n"
