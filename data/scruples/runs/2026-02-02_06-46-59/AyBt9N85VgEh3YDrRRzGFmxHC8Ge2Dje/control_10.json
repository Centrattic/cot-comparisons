She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac where he wrote down details about his wife. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author started keeping notes on his wife after meeting her. He mentions it as a way to remember important things she told him, like her love for lilacs. The almanac was private, and he never showed it to anyone. Then his wife found it, got upset, and felt betrayed. She sees it as a \"playbook\" and now he's worried about losing her trust.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intention vs. perception. The author's intention was to remember things and do sweet things for his wife. He didn't share it with others. But his wife feels like it cheapened the gestures and made her feel like he's just using a script. Betrayal is a big word there, so she's hurt. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From the author's perspective, it's a genuine effort to be attentive. But the wife's reaction shows that she's uncomfortable with being documented. Maybe she felt objectified or that his actions were insincere once she found out about the notes. \n\nIn relationships, privacy and consent are important. Even though he didn't share it with others, keeping a private document about her might be seen as not respecting her privacy. He didn't mention discussing this with her, so maybe he assumed she'd be flattered, but she didn't like being the subject of a personal log. \n\nAlso, the fact that she felt betrayed suggests that the method of remembering was an issue. She might have felt that the gestures should be spontaneous and heartfelt, not part of a prepared list. The term \"playbook\" implies she saw it as manipulative, which could have made her feel like his affection wasn't genuine. \n\nBut then again, the author's intention was good. He wanted to be a better partner by remembering her preferences. However, the problem here is the lack of communication. He didn't consider how she might feel about it. Relationships require mutual understanding, so even if the intention is good, the action might not align with the partner's comfort zone. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But since his wife is clearly upset and feels betrayed, even if the intention was good, the act of keeping a private document without her knowledge might be seen as a breach of trust. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective and privacy, leading to hurt feelings.\n"
