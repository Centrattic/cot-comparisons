She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac of his wife's preferences and stuff. So, the situation is that he created this notebook with all the details he thought he might forget, like her favorite things, and he used it to do sweet things for her. But his wife found it and felt betrayed, calling it a playbook. Now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good\u2014to remember important things about his wife because he wanted to show his love. He didn't share it with anyone, kept it private. But his wife's reaction is negative. Why? Maybe she feels that keeping a secret book like that shows a lack of trust in their relationship. Maybe she felt like he was planning things strategically rather than being genuine. Or maybe she felt that her personal details being written down without her knowledge was an invasion of privacy, even if well-intentioned.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything malicious. He was trying to be thoughtful. The problem is that the wife's feelings are hurt. The key here is communication. Did he consult her before keeping such a detailed record? Probably not. Even if the intention was good, maybe the action wasn't respecting her autonomy. People have different boundaries. What one person sees as a loving gesture, another might see as manipulative or insincere.\n\nBut then again, the act of keeping the almanac wasn't meant to be a secret from her; he just didn't tell anyone because he didn't think it was a big deal. The surprise is that she found it. The issue is that she felt it cheapened the gestures. If he was using the notes to plan things, maybe she felt the love was performative rather than spontaneous. That could lead to resentment. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but in terms of relationship dynamics, maybe he overstepped. The problem stems from a lack of open communication about boundaries. He assumed she wouldn't mind, but she did. Therefore, he should take responsibility for not discussing this with her first. So, he's not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps he should have considered her perspective and checked in with her. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since his intention was good and the action wasn't malicious, maybe the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that he needs to address communication. But the options are A or B. Since the wife's feelings are valid, even if his intentions were good, he might still be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. Hmm. It's a tough call. Some might say A (he's wrong for not considering her feelings), others might say B (he's not wrong because the intent was good). In AITA contexts, the community often looks at intent but also the impact. The impact here is significant to her. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because even though his intent was good, the action caused harm, and he didn't consider her perspective. Alternatively, maybe it's B because he didn't do it maliciously. I think in this case, since the wife's feelings are hurt and she felt betrayed, the answer leans towards A because he didn't respect her autonomy enough by keeping it a secret. But I'm not 100% sure. Different people might have different opinions here. Given that the question is a yes or no, I'll go with A because the act of keeping a secret \"playbook\" might be seen as inconsiderate in the context of their relationship.\n"
