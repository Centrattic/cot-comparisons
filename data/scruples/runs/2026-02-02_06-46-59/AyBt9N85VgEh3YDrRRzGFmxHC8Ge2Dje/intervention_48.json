She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac with notes about his wife. The author created this almanac to remember personal details about his wife, like her favorite things, to do sweet things for her. But his wife found it and now feels betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like it cheapens his gestures.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife to show his love. He didn't share it with anyone, so it was a personal effort. However, the wife's reaction is about feeling disrespected. She might see the almanac as manipulative, like he's treating her interactions as a game rather than genuine. \n\nSome key points to consider: Did the author discuss this with his wife before creating the almanac? If not, maybe he should have. The wife's perspective is that she values authenticity and might feel that the notes are insincere. The author might not have realized that keeping such a detailed list could make her uncomfortable, even if his intentions were good. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is significant. She felt betrayed, which is a strong emotion. The author's action, while well-intended, might be seen as a breach of trust because he didn't consult her about keeping these notes. Even if it's a personal practice, not sharing it could lead to misunderstandings. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are crucial. The author's approach might have lacked communication, leading to her feeling that he was keeping secrets or using her. The almanac could be perceived as a tool rather than a heartfelt gesture. \n\nSo, while the author's motives were positive, the execution might have been flawed. He didn't consider how it would make his wife feel, which is a valid concern. Therefore, he's at least partially in the wrong because he didn't communicate his actions and didn't anticipate her perspective. But maybe not entirely, since his intention wasn't to harm. However, the answer here is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife's feelings are valid and the situation stems from a lack of communication, the answer might lean towards yes.\n"
