She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down personal details about his wife to remember them and do sweet things for her. His wife found it, felt betrayed, and now they're having issues.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's intention was to remember his wife's preferences to show his love and effort. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. However, his wife perceives it as a \"playbook,\" implying he's using a script rather than genuinely remembering the details. This makes her feel like the gestures aren't sincere, which led to her feeling betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are consent and transparency. The husband didn't tell his wife about the Almanac, even though it's about her. While his intention was good, the lack of communication might have caused the problem. Maybe his wife values spontaneity and genuine memory over written notes. She might feel that using a notebook undermines the authenticity of his efforts. \n\nBut is it really wrong? He didn't use it to manipulate or deceive; he just wanted to remember. However, in relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The wife's reaction suggests that she didn't appreciate the secrecy. The husband should have discussed the Almanac with her, perhaps, to explain his reasoning. Now that it's revealed, the wife's feelings are valid even if the intention was good. \n\nSo, the question is whether not being transparent about his method of showing love is the husband's fault. Some might argue that the husband isn't in the wrong because his actions were well-meaning. Others might say that the wife's feelings are valid, and the husband should have considered how she might perceive it. \n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. If the wife feels betrayed because he kept it secret and she values genuine memory, then maybe the husband didn't do anything wrong. However, the lack of communication could be a factor. But the wife's reaction is also about how she feels about the method, not the intent. In AITA scenarios, the focus is often on intentions, but the emotional impact is also considered. \n\nHmm. The author's intention was good, but the wife's feelings are hurt. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he didn't mean to betray her, but others might say that he should have considered her perspective. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), then it's because he kept it secret and it made her feel used. If B (No), then it's about his good intentions. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the husband's actions were meant to show love and effort, even if the wife misinterpreted it. But maybe some would say A because the secrecy and the wife's feelings matter. However, in AITA, the community often considers intentions and context. The husband didn't use the Almanac for anything harmful. The wife's reaction is about her feelings of betrayal, which is valid, but the husband isn't in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards B.\n"
