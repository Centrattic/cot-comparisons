She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an Almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: He created this Almanac to remember things his wife told him, like her favorite colors, restaurants, etc. He used it to do sweet things for her. She found it and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and thinking he's using it inauthentically. Now he's worried she might destroy it and he's getting the silent treatment.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is whether keeping such a notebook is a genuine effort to remember her preferences or if it's manipulative. The author's intention was to remember things to be thoughtful, which seems good. But his wife's reaction is about feeling like he's not sincere. Maybe she felt like he's scripting his actions instead of being naturally attentive. \n\nWait, but he never showed it to anyone, kept it private. He used it to recall things, not to manipulate. The concept of a \"playbook\" might imply he's using a pre-planned list of actions to impress her, which she might see as insincere. However, the idea of a playbook is usually more about strategies for relationships, which can be manipulative. But in this case, it's just notes to help remember things. \n\nSo the user is asking if he's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, he didn't do anything illegal or morally wrong. The problem is more about the wife's perception. He might have misunderstood her feelings\u2014she might have wanted him to remember things naturally, not rely on a written list. If she feels that the effort is not genuine, even if it is, that could be a point of contention. \n\nBut is he actually wrong? If his intent was purely to remember and be considerate, then no. The issue is communication. Maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier to set the right expectations. However, the act of keeping the notes itself isn't wrong. The wife's reaction is based on her feelings, but the author's actions were meant to be loving. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But some might argue that the method of keeping a playbook, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as inauthentic. But since he's using it to help himself be more attentive, not to manipulate, it's probably not his fault. The real problem is the miscommunication between them.\n"
