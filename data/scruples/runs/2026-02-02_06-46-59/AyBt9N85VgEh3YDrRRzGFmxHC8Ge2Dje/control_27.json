She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" where he writes down personal details about his wife. The wife found out and felt betrayed, calling it a playbook. The author is confused because he did it to remember her preferences and show he cares.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was positive; he wanted to remember things to make his wife feel loved. He didn't share it with anyone. However, the wife felt it was cheapening their relationship. Maybe she felt he was treating her like a list of things to remember instead of naturally remembering her preferences. Or perhaps she felt it was a violation of privacy. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author didn't think his wife would mind, but he didn't discuss it with her first. Even with good intentions, doing something that upsets a partner can be problematic. The fact that she's hurt and considering destroying it shows the emotional impact. The author might need to realize that the method he used made her uncomfortable, even if the intent was good. \n\nOn the other hand, keeping personal notes isn't inherently wrong. But if it causes a partner to feel insecure or used, then the action has a negative consequence. The author should have considered her feelings more and maybe discussed it. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for him to understand her perspective better. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the action itself is wrong, regardless of intent. Since the wife is genuinely hurt, the action's impact matters. Therefore, the answer might be that he is not in the wrong (B), but he needs to address her feelings. Alternatively, some might say he is in the wrong (A) because he didn't consider her feelings. \n\nLooking at similar \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, often the intention isn't the main point. If the action caused harm, even without malicious intent, the person can be considered at fault. But in this case, the author's intention was caring. However, the wife's reaction is valid. So maybe the author is not in the wrong (B) because his intent was positive, even though the outcome was negative. He should still apologize and find another way to remember her preferences. The key is whether the action itself is wrong. Since keeping notes isn't a harmful act, but the effect was negative, the answer might be B. But some might argue A because he didn't think about her perspective. Hmm. I think the answer is B, No, he's not in the wrong, but he needs to address her feelings. However, others might say A. But according to typical AITA responses, the focus is on intent and actions. If the action was well-meaning and not malicious, even if it caused unintended harm, the person is not the asshole. So B.\n"
