She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an almanac, which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife. The situation is that his wife found out about it and is upset, feeling betrayed. The author thinks he's not in the wrong because he did it out of love to remember things.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy and consent. The author didn't tell his wife about the almanac, even though it contains personal information she shared. He kept it secret, which might have been a breach of trust. Even if his intentions were good, keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge could make her feel like he's treating her as an object or that he's using her personal details for his own \"playbook,\" which she found offensive. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She said it cheapened the sweet things he did for her, implying that she felt the gestures were insincere because they were part of a plan he'd written down. That suggests that the act of keeping the almanac, while well-intentioned, might have made her feel like he wasn't genuinely present or attentive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to remember things to show his love, which isn't malicious. But the issue is whether keeping such a secret in a relationship is acceptable. Trust in a relationship often requires transparency, so not disclosing something personal like that could be seen as a mistake.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A because the author didn't consider the wife's perspective and kept something private that might have been better discussed. Even if the intention was good, the lack of communication is a problem. The wife's feeling of betrayal is valid here.\n"
