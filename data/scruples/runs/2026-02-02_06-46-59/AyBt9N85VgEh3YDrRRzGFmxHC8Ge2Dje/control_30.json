She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation they described. The scenario is about a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" with various personal details about his wife that he wanted to remember. The wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed, thinking it's a \"playbook\" rather than a genuine effort to remember her. The author is confused because he thought it was a kind gesture, and now his wife is acting cold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband created the Almanac to remember his wife's preferences and details, which he couldn't keep in his head. He never showed it to anyone, kept it private. The wife discovers it and reacts negatively, feeling that it cheapens his gestures and that he's using it as a playbook. The author is upset and doesn't know if he's at fault.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break down possible angles. On one hand, keeping notes to remember personal details could be seen as a thoughtful way to show he cares. People often forget things, so using a notebook might be a practical solution. The husband's intention was positive, to do sweet things for his wife by recalling her likes. However, the wife's reaction is important here. She might feel that the notes are being used inauthentically, as if he's just going through a list of things to do, rather than truly remembering and caring. The term \"playbook\" suggests that she thinks he's using these notes to manipulate or perform for her, which could make her feel like his actions are insincere.\n\nBut the husband's reasoning is that he's trying to be the kind of partner who remembers important things, and he didn't want to be the one who forgets. The problem arises from the wife's perception. It's possible that the husband's method of using a notebook, while well-intentioned, triggered her insecurities or made her feel like he wasn't truly paying attention. The emotional response is significant here; even if the action was meant to be good, if it causes hurt feelings, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The husband didn't tell his wife about the notebook. Maybe she would have understood or even appreciated it if he had talked to her about it. But by keeping it secret, she found out in a way that made her feel blindsided. The way he found out about her reaction is through her discovering it without prior discussion. So, perhaps the issue isn't the notebook itself, but the lack of transparency.\n\nIs using a notebook inherently wrong? Not necessarily. Many people use notes or journals to remember things. But the wife's interpretation is that it's a strategy rather than genuine memory. If she feels that his gestures are less heartfelt because he's relying on a list, that's a valid emotion. Even if the husband believes he's doing it out of love, the wife's feelings of betrayal and the impact on their relationship matter. \n\nPossible factors that could make the husband at fault: not communicating his intentions, the wife's perception of insincerity, and the emotional harm caused. Alternatively, if the husband's method is seen as a lack of effort or genuine memory, that might also be a point. But the husband's point is that he's trying to remember, and using the notebook helps him do that. \n\nThe key here is that the wife is upset, and the husband is trying to understand why. In relationships, actions that are meant to be good can sometimes have unintended consequences. The husband's approach might have been to document things to help his memory, but the wife's reaction indicates that she felt it was inauthentic. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would depend on the intention versus the impact. If the intention was good but the impact was negative, does that make him at fault? In this case, the husband didn't mean to be inauthentic, but the result is that his wife feels that way. However, the husband's action isn't inherently wrong unless there was deceit or ulterior motives. Since he didn't share it with anyone and just wanted to remember, the issue might be more about the wife's feelings than the action itself. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), because the husband's intention was to remember and show love, and the problem is the wife's interpretation and the lack of communication, not the act of keeping notes. But I need to be careful. Some might argue that using a notebook to remember things you should have memorized through genuine effort is wrong. However, the husband clearly states that he's trying to avoid being the one who forgets, which is a common issue. The problem is the wife's reaction, which is a matter of perception and trust. The husband didn't do anything malicious, so he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
