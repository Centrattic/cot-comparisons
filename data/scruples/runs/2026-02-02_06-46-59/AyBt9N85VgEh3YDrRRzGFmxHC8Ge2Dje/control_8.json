She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of details about their wife. The author wrote down things like her favorite colors, books, etc., to remember and do sweet things for her. But the wife found it and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook.\"\n\nHmm. The author didn't tell her about it before, and now she's upset. The key points here are about intention versus perception. The author's intention was to remember things to be thoughtful, but the wife felt it was manipulative. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author didn't mean to hurt her, but the act of keeping a secret list might have made her feel like he was treating her like a project. Maybe she felt like he wasn't genuine in his gestures if he was just following a list. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is trying to be a good husband by remembering things. He didn't share it because he didn't think it was a big deal. The problem is that the wife didn't know about it, so she couldn't have consented or been comfortable with it. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? Well, maybe not in intention, but in not discussing it with her. The fact that he kept it a secret and she felt betrayed suggests that he should have communicated his reasons. It's possible that he overstepped by not being transparent. But then again, keeping notes is common. Maybe the issue is the name \"Almanac\" and the way it was presented made it seem like a strategy rather than a personal memento.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author didn't consider that his wife might have different feelings about it. Even if his intention was good, not discussing it might have caused harm. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. The answer might be B, No, because he didn't mean to hurt her, but there's a valid reason she's upset. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife feels betrayed, even if his intent was good, maybe he is in the wrong for not being open about it. Or perhaps not, because the act itself isn't malicious. It's a bit tricky. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No) because the author's intention was to be loving and thoughtful, but there's a valid argument that the wife's feelings are important. However, the core of the question is about whether the author is at fault. Since he didn't intend to hurt her and was trying to be a good partner, maybe he isn't in the wrong. The mistake was not discussing it with her, but that's a communication issue rather than being inherently wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
