She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says they think the author is in the wrong and wants to know my opinion.\n\nThe situation is about a guy who wrote down all sorts of personal details about his wife in a notebook called The Almanac. He did this because he wanted to remember things she mentioned, like her love for lilacs and other preferences. His intention was to make sweet gestures for her. However, his wife found the notebook and felt betrayed. She called it a \"playbook\" and said it cheapened his gestures. Now she's upset and might even destroy it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is that he's trying to be attentive and remember important things about her. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. But the wife's reaction is that she feels he's using it as a tool to manipulate her, instead of genuinely remembering from his heart. The key here is about trust and how he handled the information.\n\nThe husband didn't think there was anything wrong with keeping the notes, but the wife's feelings are valid. Even if his intention was good, keeping such a detailed record of her personal information without her knowledge might have crossed a line. It could be seen as an invasion of privacy, even if it's about things she shared with him. When someone shares personal information, they expect it to be respected and kept confidential. Creating a notebook with all that info and then using it for gestures might make her feel like he's not being genuine, but using tricks to appear attentive.\n\nAnother angle is consent. The wife didn't know about the notes, so she didn't give permission for that information to be recorded. Even though she shared the details herself, the act of compiling them into a personal \"playbook\" might make her feel uncomfortable. It's possible that she values spontaneity and natural memory over scripted gestures, which could explain why she's upset.\n\nThe husband's actions might have been well-meaning, but he didn't consider how his wife would perceive the notebook. The fact that she's feeling betrayed suggests that the method he used to show his love isn't aligning with how she wants to be loved. In relationships, communication is key. Had he discussed his method with her beforehand, maybe he could have avoided this issue.\n\nSo, even though his intentions were good, the way he handled it might have been wrong. The wife's feelings are valid, and the husband should have considered her perspective. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't think about how keeping such a detailed record could affect his wife's sense of privacy and authenticity in their relationship.\n"
