She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook where they jot down personal details about their wife. The wife found out and feels betrayed, thinking it's a playbook. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nHmm. So, the author's intention was to remember personal details because they love their wife, but the wife felt it was a betrayal. The key here is the wife's feelings versus the author's intentions. The author didn't share it with anyone, but the mere existence of the notes upset the wife.\n\nI need to consider if the author's action was wrong. Was there any deceit? The author didn't hide it in a malicious way, but they didn't mention it either. The wife didn't know about it until she found it. So maybe the issue is about lack of communication. The author didn't discuss with the wife why they were keeping the notes, assuming it was a good idea. But the wife felt it was a betrayal because she thought he should remember these things naturally instead of relying on notes. \n\nIs keeping notes inherently wrong? Not necessarily. People have different ways of remembering things. But if the wife felt her personal details were being cataloged, maybe she felt objectified or that the author wasn't being genuine. The author's intention was good, but the execution might have been lacking. The wife's reaction is valid because trust and feelings matter in a relationship. The author should have discussed this with her, maybe, instead of keeping it a secret. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their actions, leading to the wife's hurt feelings. Even if the intention was good, the lack of transparency could be the issue. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
