She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an almanac with personal notes about his wife. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe man started the almanac to remember details about his wife, like her favorite things, to do nice things for her. He never showed it to anyone else. His wife found out and reacted negatively, feeling betrayed, like it's a \"playbook\" instead of genuine effort. Now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intent versus the impact. The author's intention was to remember things to be loving and thoughtful. But the wife's reaction is about feeling like her personal details are being cataloged in a way that's inauthentic or manipulative. She might feel that instead of truly remembering these things from the heart, he's just going through a list, which makes her feel like a project rather than a partner. \n\nAlso, the fact that she found the almanac and is considering destroying it suggests that the privacy of her personal preferences and memories is being invaded, even if well-intentioned. There's a line between being thoughtful and keeping a secret record that the other person might not be comfortable with. The author didn't think about her perspective on this; he assumed that keeping notes was a good thing, but she sees it as insincere.\n\nAnother angle: trust and transparency. The man didn't share this with her before. Even though he didn't mean to, by keeping it secret, it might have made her feel like he's hiding something. The betrayal she mentions could stem from the secrecy rather than the act of noting things. If he had discussed it with her earlier, maybe she would have been okay with it, but the surprise of finding it without his explanation led to her negative reaction.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not considering her feelings about privacy and the perception of inauthenticity. Even though his intentions were good, the way he went about it without her knowledge could be the issue. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't consider how she might feel about him keeping such a detailed record without her consent.\n"
