She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an Almanac of their wife's preferences. The situation is that the author started writing down details about their wife, like her favorite flowers, colors, etc., to remember them and do sweet things. The wife found the notebook and felt betrayed, thinking it's a playbook, so she's upset.\n\nHmm. First, the author's intention was good\u2014to remember important things about their wife. They kept it private and never showed anyone else. But the wife's reaction is about feeling that the Almanac cheapened the gestures. She might feel that the act of writing things down makes it feel more calculated rather than genuine. Maybe she wanted the love and attention to come naturally without being recorded.\n\nThe author might have thought that keeping notes was a helpful way to show love, but the wife might perceive it as inauthentic. The key here is the wife's feelings. Even if the author's intention was good, if the wife is hurt and feels betrayed, the author might have overlooked her perspective. The author should have considered how the wife would feel if she found out. Maybe the author assumed it was a good idea without discussing it with her, leading to misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily evil, but they may not have considered the emotional impact on their spouse. In relationships, transparency and mutual understanding are important. The Almanac, while well-intentioned, might have been something the wife didn't want documented. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions, though well-meaning, caused harm without their spouse's consent or understanding. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their actions would affect their wife's feelings about the relationship's authenticity.\n"
