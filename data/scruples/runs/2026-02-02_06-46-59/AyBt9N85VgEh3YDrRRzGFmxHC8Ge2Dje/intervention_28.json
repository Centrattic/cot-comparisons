She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. The author has an \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook where he writes down personal details about his wife\u2014her favorite things, memories, etc. He created it so he wouldn't forget important stuff and to do sweet things for her. But now his wife is upset, saying it feels like a playbook and she feels betrayed. The author is confused because he didn't mean to do anything wrong and feels heartbroken that she's upset.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The author's intention was good. He wanted to remember things to be a better partner, which seems thoughtful. But his wife's reaction is about feeling like he's treating their relationship like a script. Maybe she felt that keeping track of these things in a systematic way made her feel like she was being cataloged or that he wasn't naturally remembering things because he should, not because he had a list. Trust might be an issue here. If he kept this a secret, maybe she felt he wasn't being transparent. Even though he didn't share it with anyone, the fact that he kept it hidden could make her feel like he's controlling or manipulative, even if he didn't mean to.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend to hurt her. He created the Almanac out of love and a desire to remember important things. He didn't use it to manipulate or control; he used it to make sweet gestures. However, maybe the problem is that he didn't discuss it with her before. If he had shared his intention with her, maybe she would have understood. But by keeping it a secret, he might have undermined her trust. She might feel that he's not trusting her with his feelings or that he's keeping something that should be open between them.\n\nAnother angle: relationships often involve mutual understanding and communication. If she didn't know about the Almanac and then found out, her reaction could be about the surprise element. She might have felt that if he really remembered things naturally, he wouldn't need a list. It's possible she felt objectified or that her personal details were being stored without her consent, even if it was for a good reason.\n\nBut the author's actions were meant to be kind. He didn't harm her intentionally. However, the effect was negative. The question is whether the action itself was wrong. Sometimes, even with good intentions, actions can be inappropriate if they make the other person uncomfortable. In this case, the Almanac was a private thing he created without her knowledge. If she feels betrayed, maybe the issue is about respecting her autonomy. She might prefer that he remember things without needing to write them down, or she might feel that the existence of such a list makes her feel like she has to perform or be perfect.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author violated trust or made her feel uncomfortable by keeping track of these details in a private notebook. If the wife's feelings are valid, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective. However, if the author's intentions were purely good and the issue is just a miscommunication, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But since the wife is clearly hurt and feels betrayed, the author might need to take responsibility for not communicating his actions and respecting her feelings.\n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't consult with his wife about his method of remembering things. By keeping the Almanac a secret, he might have assumed his approach was fine without considering her feelings. Even if the intention was good, the method could have been inappropriate because it involved keeping something private that affects their relationship dynamics. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his wife's perspective and his actions led to her feeling betrayed, even if unintentionally.\n"
