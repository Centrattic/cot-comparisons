She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author wrote an \"Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and memories, intending to remember her better. But his wife found it and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" that cheapened his gestures. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was good: he wanted to remember important details to show he cares. He kept it private and only used it to do sweet things for her. But the wife's reaction is about feeling like her partner is using a script, which made her feel like the love was insincere. \n\nWhy would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneous, genuine acts over planned ones. If he's keeping a list, she might feel like he's just checking off things instead of truly being present. It could also be a breach of trust if she found out about the Almanac without being told. The author didn't mention it before, so maybe she felt it was an invasion of privacy, even though he kept it a secret for her benefit. \n\nBut then again, the author didn't have bad intentions. He wanted to show love. However, the wife's feelings matter. Even if the intent was good, the action led to hurt feelings. The key here is whether the method of showing love was appropriate. If the wife feels it undermines the authenticity of his actions, then maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective. \n\nBut is it really the author's fault? He didn't set out to hurt her. Maybe the issue is a miscommunication. They might need to talk about how each expresses and receives love. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong; it's just a difference in expectations. \n\nHmm. It's tricky. On one hand, the author's actions were well-meaning. On the other, the wife's feelings are valid. The answer might hinge on whether keeping the Almanac crossed into something that felt manipulative or insincere. If the wife felt betrayed, then the author's action, though intended to be loving, caused harm. So, maybe he is in the wrong. But others might argue it's a communication issue. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his action, despite good intentions, led to his wife feeling used and betrayed. Even if he meant well, the impact is what matters here. The wife's reaction is a clear sign that the method wasn't appreciated, so he should have considered her feelings more carefully.\n"
