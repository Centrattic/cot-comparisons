She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author creating an \"Almanac\" of personal notes about his wife's preferences and memories, which she found out about and is upset with him for.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the story. The author started keeping notes to remember his wife's likes and dislikes, aiming to do sweet things for her. He never showed it to anyone, kept it private. But when his wife found out about it, she felt betrayed, called it a \"playbook,\" and is upset. The author is confused and hurt, thinking he's doing something loving by remembering these details, and now he's worried she might destroy the notebook.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user already thinks he might be, but wants another opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nPossible angles to consider:\n1. Intention vs. Impact: The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember things to make his wife feel loved. However, the impact was negative. His wife felt like her personal details were being used as a strategy, which might have made her feel objectified or like her feelings were being manipulated. Even if the intention was good, the effect matters here.\n\n2. Transparency and Consent: Did the author consult with his wife about keeping such a detailed notebook? Since he kept it a secret, she wasn't part of the decision-making. Some people might find it creepy or invasive if their partner keeps a private record without discussing it. Trust is a big part of relationships, and keeping something like that hidden could be seen as undermining that trust.\n\n3. Cultural or Personal Boundaries: Different people have different comfort levels. The wife might come from a background where privacy is highly valued, or she might feel that sharing personal preferences is meant to be part of the relationship's natural flow, not something that's documented to be used later. The author might not have considered her perspective on this.\n\n4. The Concept of a \"Playbook\": The wife's term \"playbook\" implies that she feels like he's gaming the system, using a list to win points in the relationship. This could stem from a fear of being loved conditionally or not for who she is, but for the actions she takes. If she perceives that he's using these notes to manipulate her emotions, that's a significant issue.\n\n5. Communication Issues: The author didn't communicate his reasons for keeping the Almanac until after she found out. Open communication is key in relationships. If he had discussed it with her earlier, maybe she could have expressed her feelings then, and they could have addressed it together.\n\n6. Emotional Response: The wife is clearly hurt, which is a valid reaction. Even if the author didn't mean to, his actions caused her distress. The question is whether his actions were a mistake regardless of the intent.\n\nCounterpoints:\n- The author's actions were meant to be loving. He wanted to remember important things to show his wife he cares. That's a positive intent.\n- Keeping a personal notebook isn't inherently wrong; many people do similar things. For example, some people keep lists for personal goals, but in this case, it's about a spouse's preferences.\n- The wife's reaction might be overblown. Maybe she's not used to such attention to detail, or there's another underlying issue in the relationship causing her to react this way.\n\nHowever, the main issue seems to be about privacy and consent. The author didn't consider how she might feel about her personal details being recorded without her knowledge. Even if he thought it was a good idea, not consulting her first might have been a mistake. The wife's feeling of betrayal suggests that she values her privacy and autonomy in the relationship more than he anticipated.\n\nIn many relationships, sharing personal information is done with the expectation that it's for the sake of the relationship. However, when that information is recorded and kept in a private notebook, it can create a sense of being watched or used, even if that's not the intention. The term \"playbook\" is telling here\u2014she might feel that he's using a script to maintain the relationship, which can be seen as inauthentic or manipulative.\n\nAnother angle is the difference in how people express love. The author shows love through acts of service and remembrance, while the wife might prefer emotional intimacy or words of affirmation. The Almanac was his way of doing the former, but she might feel that it's impersonal or insincere compared to spontaneous gestures.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were good, the method he chose could be problematic. Not discussing it with his wife and keeping it a secret led to her feeling betrayed. The key here is the lack of communication and the wife's valid emotional response. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his actions, though well-meaning, caused harm due to a lack of consideration for his wife's feelings and privacy.\n"
