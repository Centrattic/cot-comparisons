She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about his wife. The story is that he started writing down things like her favorite colors, books, etc., to remember them and do sweet things for her. The wife found out, felt betrayed, and called it a \"playbook,\" making her feel like he was using it to manipulate or cheapen his gestures. \n\nHmm. The author's intention was to remember important things about his wife, which is a good and loving motive. But the issue is that the wife didn't know about it and found it off-putting. Trust and communication are key in relationships. Even if the intention was good, keeping something like that secret might have been a mistake. Maybe he should have discussed it with her earlier. The wife feels like he didn't remember things organically, which might make her feel like he's not truly paying attention. Also, the fact that he was the only one who knew about it and never shared it could imply that he felt the need to control the information, which might make her feel like he's not being transparent. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't mean to hurt her. He created the almanac out of love and to avoid being the type of husband who forgets important things. The problem is that the way he kept it hidden led to her feeling betrayed. So it's a mix of intention vs. perception. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of his motives, but maybe the method of keeping it secret was wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we go by the wife's reaction and her feeling of betrayal, then maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong because his intentions were positive. But if we consider the impact of keeping secrets and not discussing such things in the relationship, then he might be in the wrong for not being transparent. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't have malicious intent, but the action caused hurt, it's a bit tricky. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at both intention and impact. The impact here was negative, but the intention was positive. However, the fact that he kept it a secret and the wife felt it was manipulative suggests that the author might be in the wrong because his actions, although well-meaning, led to hurt and a breach of trust. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit confused because the intention is good. But in relationships, transparency is important. So maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate his actions, even if he thought it was for the best.\n"
