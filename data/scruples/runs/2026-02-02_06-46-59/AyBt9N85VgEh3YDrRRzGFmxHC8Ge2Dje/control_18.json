She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he created this Almanac as a way to remember his wife's preferences and things she mentioned. The idea was to make sure he could do sweet things for her by not forgetting important details. But when his wife found out, she felt betrayed and thought he was using it as a playbook, which made her feel like the sweet gestures were insincere.\n\nHmm, why would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory over something written down. She might have felt that by writing things down, he was being inauthentic, like he was just going through a script instead of truly knowing her. Even though his intention was good, the way it came across might have made her feel like he wasn't paying attention or was using a strategy to seem attentive.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's intention was to show love and care. He didn't keep it from her out of deceit; he was just trying to remember. The problem might be about trust and how she perceived the use of the Almanac. If he had asked her about it before using it, maybe she would have had different feelings. But he kept it a secret, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it was well-meaning.\n\nSo is the fault his? Maybe. He should have considered that keeping such a personal record without discussing it with her might make her uncomfortable. The fact that he didn't share it with anyone else suggests he was keeping it private, but in a relationship, transparency is important. His actions, while intended to be loving, might have inadvertently made her feel like he wasn't truly present in their relationship. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective and kept something that could affect their trust.\n"
