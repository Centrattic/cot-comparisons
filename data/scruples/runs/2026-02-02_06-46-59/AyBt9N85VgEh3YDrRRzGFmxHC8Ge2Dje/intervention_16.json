She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about his wife. The story is about how he started keeping these notes to remember important things about her, like her favorite things. He never showed anyone or told anyone about it, but his wife found it and is upset. She feels like it's a \"playbook\" and that he's being manipulative instead of genuinely remembering things.\n\nHmm, the author's intention was to remember things he cares about, but the wife interprets it negatively. So, is it the author's fault? Well, he didn't do anything malicious. He kept it private and meant it as a loving gesture. But maybe he didn't consider how she might feel about having her personal details recorded. Did he overstep by keeping such detailed notes without discussing it with her? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine memory more than planned acts. \n\nOn the other hand, keeping notes to remember things isn't inherently wrong. Many people use reminders. But if it made her feel like he's using a script, that could be a problem. The key here is the wife's feelings. Even though his intent was good, the outcome was hurtful. However, did he have any obligation to share this practice? Since he didn't know she'd find it, maybe not. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the question is about whether his actions were wrong, considering intent vs. outcome. Some might say no, because his intentions were good. Others might say yes, because it affected her negatively regardless of intent. But the author's actions were not deceitful or harmful on purpose. The wife's reaction is valid, but that doesn't necessarily make him at fault. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance. He might need to discuss things with her to understand her feelings better, but the act of keeping notes itself isn't wrong. The problem is more about their communication and differing expectations. So the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe there's room for both sides to adjust.\n"
