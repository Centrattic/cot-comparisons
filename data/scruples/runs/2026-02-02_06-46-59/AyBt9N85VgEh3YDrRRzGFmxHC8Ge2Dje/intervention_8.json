She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author wrote about keeping an Almanac, which is a notebook where he jots down personal details about his wife. He started this because he wanted to remember things like her favorite flowers, colors, restaurants, etc., so he could do sweet things for her. The wife discovered the notebook and felt betrayed, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like the sweet gestures were cheapened. The author is confused and hurt, thinking he was showing love by remembering these things, and now the wife is upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user already thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: he kept the Almanac to remember things to make their marriage better. He didn't share it with anyone and didn't use it for anything negative. He wanted to be attentive and thoughtful, which seems like a positive action. Keeping notes to remember personal details is something many people do, and it's a sign of caring.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction suggests that she felt his actions were inauthentic or manipulative. She might have felt that the gestures were insincere because they were planned from a playbook, making her feel like she's being used to fulfill his idea of a good husband. She might also feel that her feelings are not genuine because he's using notes to create these moments. There's a lack of transparency here; even though he didn't mean to, he didn't discuss the notebook with her before. Maybe she would have preferred him to remember things naturally or felt that the existence of the notebook was a way to control or script their relationship.\n\nBut was the act of keeping the notebook itself wrong? The author didn't use it to deceive or manipulate. He used it to remember things he truly wanted to remember. The problem arises from how the wife perceived it. Maybe the issue is more about communication rather than the action itself. The author didn't ask her if this approach was okay, and her feelings were hurt. So, perhaps the mistake was not in keeping the notebook but in not discussing it with her. However, is that the author's fault? If he thought it was just a personal way to be better, maybe he's not wrong. Alternatively, if he should have considered how she might feel about him keeping such a detailed record, then he is at fault for not being considerate enough.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's reaction might stem from feeling that her partner isn't truly present in the relationship. If he's relying on a notebook to remember things, maybe she feels he's not engaging fully with her. But the author argues that he does remember these things because he's in love and wants to be attentive. The notebook is just a tool to help him not forget. So, maybe the wife's perception is different from the author's intention.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel respected and that actions are genuine. If the wife feels that the notebook makes the gestures feel insincere, then the author, even with good intentions, might have caused hurt. However, the author didn't intend to make things feel insincere. It's a misunderstanding of perspectives.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the problem is about the wife's feelings and the author not anticipating how she might feel about the notebook, then he could be at fault for not considering her perspective. But if the action itself (keeping notes) isn't inherently wrong, then maybe he's not. It's more about the communication between the two.\n\nIn AITA situations, the key is often about intent versus impact. The author's intent was good, but the impact was harmful. In such cases, the person is often not in the wrong if they had no malicious intent, but they might have to take responsibility for the impact. However, in some cases, the act itself can be considered wrong if it's a breach of trust or privacy, but in this scenario, the author wasn't keeping secrets with bad intentions.\n\nWait, the wife found the notebook. The author never showed it to anyone, so it wasn't a secret he was keeping from her. But maybe the fact that he kept a detailed record of personal things about her could be seen as invasive or treating her like a project. However, the author's intention was to care for her, not to use her. So, the question is whether the wife's feelings are valid.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions were well-intentioned, but the wife's perspective is that the notebook made her feel like the gestures were insincere. If the author hadn't kept the notebook, the gestures would still be from his heart, but by keeping it, she feels they're part of a script. It's a matter of perception. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but he might have overlooked how his actions could be perceived. However, since the notebook was a private way to help him remember, it's debatable whether that's a mistake. I think the answer hinges on whether the act of keeping the notebook itself is wrong, which it's not, but the lack of communication or consideration for the wife's feelings might be. But since the author didn't have ill intent, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the wife's feelings are valid, then perhaps he is partially responsible for not considering her perspective. But in AITA terms, if the action isn't inherently wrong and the issue is differing perceptions, then maybe he's not in the wrong. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
