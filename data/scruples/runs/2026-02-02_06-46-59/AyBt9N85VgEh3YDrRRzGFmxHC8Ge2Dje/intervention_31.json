She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who created an \"Almanac\" of notes about his wife's preferences and memories, which he uses to plan sweet gestures. His wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed, as if it's a playbook rather than genuine effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important details about his wife because he cares. He kept it private and never showed anyone else. The wife, on the other hand, feels that having a written list cheapens the efforts and makes it seem like he's just following a script instead of showing genuine love. She might feel that the act of writing things down is manipulative or insincere, like he's calculating ways to impress her rather than doing things from the heart.\n\nThe key points here are consent and perspective. The husband didn't ask the wife if she was okay with him keeping the Almanac. While his intentions are good, the wife's feelings are valid because she didn't consent to this being part of their relationship dynamics. She might feel that her personal information is being used in a way she didn't agree to, even if it's with good intentions. Trust and mutual agreement are important in relationships, so keeping something like this a secret without considering the other person's perspective could be an issue.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's reaction. She's hurt and feels that the Almanac undermines her perception of his love. If someone relies on written notes to remember things that should be part of a genuine connection, it might make her feel like he's not truly present or engaged in remembering her as a person. It's possible that she values spontaneity and natural affection over rehearsed gestures, even if they're well-meaning.\n\nHowever, the husband's actions stem from wanting to be a better partner and avoid being forgetful. The problem here is communication. He didn't discuss the Almanac with her, and her reaction shows that she might prefer him to remember things instinctively rather than through a notebook. The issue isn't the act of taking notes itself but the lack of transparency and the potential misunderstanding of how it affects her emotionally.\n\nIn relationships, even well-intentioned actions can be problematic if they're done without considering the other person's feelings. The husband's mistake was not discussing this with his wife and keeping it secret. The wife's feelings of betrayal and being cheapened are significant and should be acknowledged. \n\nSo, while the husband's intentions are good, the execution lacked communication. Therefore, he is in the wrong because the secretiveness and lack of consent contributed to her feeling betrayed. The answer would be A.\n"
