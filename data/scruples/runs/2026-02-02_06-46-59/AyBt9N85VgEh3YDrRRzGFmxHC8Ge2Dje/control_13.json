She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The story is about a husband who kept a notebook called \"The Almanac\" with notes about his wife's preferences and things he wanted to remember to do for her. The wife found out and is upset, feeling betrayed and thinking it's a \"playbook.\" The husband is confused and heartbroken, believing he was just trying to remember important things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's intention was good; he wanted to remember his wife's likes and do thoughtful things. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. The wife, however, felt that the existence of the notebook made the gestures feel insincere or manipulative. She might feel that he shouldn't need a notebook to remember personal details about her, implying that he should remember them naturally because of their relationship.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, transparency and mutual understanding are important. The husband didn't think the notebook was an issue, but the wife's reaction shows that it's a problem for her. The key here is whether the notebook crossed a boundary. The husband didn't use it to manipulate or deceive, but the wife perceives it as such. The question is about right and wrong. The husband's actions were well-meaning, but if it's causing hurt and the wife is upset, maybe he should consider her feelings even if his intent was good. However, the wife's reaction might also be overreacting if the notebook was meant to help, not to deceive. \n\nBut in relationships, how you make the other person feel matters. Even if the husband's intention was good, if it makes his wife feel like he's treating her as a project, that's a problem. The wife might feel that he's not being genuine, which is a serious issue. So while the husband isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in terms of malicious intent, he might have overlooked the emotional impact on his wife. The answer might depend on cultural or personal norms. In many cases, partners expect spontaneity and genuine memory of details without needing a written list. The husband's approach, while helpful for him, might not align with his wife's expectations of love and attention. Therefore, the husband could be considered in the wrong because his action, though well-meaning, caused hurt and the wife's feelings are valid in this context. So the answer might be A (Yes), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the mistake was not in the action but in not communicating better, then maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, not if there's room for improvement. Since the wife's feelings are valid, and the husband's action, while not malicious, led to betrayal, maybe he is in the wrong. So Answer A.\n"
