She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by keeping the Almanac, which is a notebook with notes about his wife's preferences and memories.\n\nFirst, the author created the Almanac to remember details about his wife. His intention was to remember important things so he could do sweet things for her. He didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. His wife found it and felt betrayed, considering it a \"playbook\" that cheapened his gestures. She's upset and maybe thinking of destroying it.\n\nNow, why would she feel that way? Maybe she values spontaneity and genuine effort over rehearsed actions. The Almanac, while well-intentioned, might come across as manipulative or insincere to her. Even if the author's motives were good, the effect on his wife is emotional distress. Trust and honesty in relationships are important. By keeping secrets, even if they're not harmful, it can lead to misunderstandings. The author didn't communicate his reasons to her immediately, leading to her feeling like she was being played. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. He wanted to remember and show love. But his wife's feelings are valid. The issue here might be about transparency. If he had shared his intentions earlier, maybe she wouldn't have felt this way. The fact that he kept it a secret for so long and then she found it out could be the real problem. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. He acted from a good place but didn't consider how it might make her feel. Secrecy in a relationship can sometimes lead to issues, even if the intentions are good. The key here is that the wife's feelings are hurt, and the author's actions led to that, even unintentionally. Therefore, he might be at fault for not being open about his actions and for creating a situation where she felt like he was keeping score or planning gestures instead of naturally remembering things. \n\nBut then again, some might argue that the wife overreacted. The author's actions were meant to be caring. However, the wife's reaction is legitimate because she feels betrayed. So, in terms of right or wrong, the author's wrongdoings would be the secrecy and not considering her perspective, leading to emotional harm. Hence, maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
