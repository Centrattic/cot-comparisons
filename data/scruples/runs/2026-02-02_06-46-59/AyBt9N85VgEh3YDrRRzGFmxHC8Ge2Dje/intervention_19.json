She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the \"Almanac,\" which is a notebook where the husband writes down all sorts of personal details about his wife\u2014her favorites, things she mentioned, etc. He uses it to remember and do sweet things for her. But when his wife found out, she felt betrayed and thought it was a \"playbook,\" which made her feel cheapened.\n\nHmm. The husband's intention was good, right? He wanted to remember important things about her because he loves her. But the wife felt like he was using the information as a strategy, like a playbook, which made her uncomfortable. That's the crux here. The question is whether keeping a secret notebook with personal details, even with good intentions, crosses a line.\n\nOn one hand, the husband didn't share it with anyone and kept it private. He didn't use it to manipulate but to remember. But on the other hand, maybe he should have considered that his wife might not be comfortable with him keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge. Trust is important in a relationship, and if something makes the other person feel like they're being treated as a checklist, that's a problem. \n\nThe wife's reaction is valid because she felt the information was being used in a way that diminished her feelings. Even if the husband didn't mean it that way, her perspective matters. The fact that she mentioned she hasn't decided if he can have it back yet and might destroy it shows how hurt she is. \n\nSo, maybe the husband did overstep by not communicating his intentions better. Even though his goal was to be a better partner, keeping such a secret might have caused unintended harm. The key is whether the action, despite good intentions, violated the wife's sense of trust or privacy. \n\nI think the answer hinges on communication. If he had shared his habit with her earlier, maybe she would have appreciated it. But since he kept it a secret and she found out this way, it's possible that he did act in the wrong, even if unintentionally. So, the answer might be A.\n"
