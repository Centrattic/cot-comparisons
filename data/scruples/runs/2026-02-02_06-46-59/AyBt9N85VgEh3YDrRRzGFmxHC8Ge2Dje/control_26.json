She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who kept an Almanac, a notebook with personal details about his wife. His wife found it and is upset, feeling betrayed, thinking he's using it as a \"playbook\" instead of truly remembering things from the heart.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband's intention was to remember important details about his wife because he wanted to do sweet things for her. He didn't share the notebook with anyone and kept it private. However, the wife's reaction is strong\u2014feeling that the Almanac cheapens his gestures and that she's betrayed. \n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is at fault. From a moral standpoint, keeping notes to remember personal details seems like a thoughtful gesture. The husband's actions were meant to show love and attentiveness. But the wife interprets it as insincere, like he's just going through a list rather than genuinely caring. \n\nCommunication issues might be a factor here. The husband didn't explain his reasoning before she found out, which could have led to misunderstandings. However, the act of keeping the notes itself isn't inherently wrong. It's about the wife's feelings and how they were hurt. \n\nThe husband didn't do anything deceptive beyond keeping the notebook private. He didn't use the information in a manipulative way. The wife's reaction is more about feeling that his gestures are not sincere, even if they are well-intentioned. \n\nIn relationships, intentions matter, but perceptions also play a role. If the wife feels betrayed, even if the intentions were good, the husband might need to address her feelings. However, the act of keeping the Almanac isn't necessarily wrong. The problem might stem from a lack of communication rather than the action itself. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. His actions were motivated by love and a desire to be attentive. The issue is more about the wife's interpretation and the need for better communication rather than the husband's actions being inherently wrong.\n"
