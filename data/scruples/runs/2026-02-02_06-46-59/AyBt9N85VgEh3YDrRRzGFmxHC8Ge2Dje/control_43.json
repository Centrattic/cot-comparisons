She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author started keeping a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he writes down details about his wife's preferences, like her love for lilacs, favorite colors, restaurants, etc. He does this so he doesn't forget these things and can do sweet things for her. Recently, his wife found out about the notebook and is upset, saying it's a \"playbook\" and feels betrayed. She's considering destroying it. The author is confused because he thought this was a thoughtful gesture, not a bad one.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intention behind the notebook and how the wife interprets it. The author's intention is definitely good; he wants to remember important things about his wife to show his love and care. But the wife's reaction is that it feels like a playbook, which makes her feel like he's using these notes to manipulate or rehearse his affection. That's a betrayal of trust, maybe? She might feel like he's not genuinely remembering things but relying on a list, which could come off as insincere.\n\nAnother angle: privacy. Even though he's keeping notes about her, the fact that she found out and feels like he's been keeping a secret might be an issue. Maybe she didn't want him to have a detailed record of her personal preferences. It's possible she values spontaneity or feels that such things should be remembered naturally without notes. The author didn't mean to make it a secret, but the existence of the notebook might have crossed a line she didn't realize.\n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" suggests that she thinks he's using these notes strategically, like a script, which could make her feel like his gestures are not heartfelt. Even if he's not using it that way, the perception is there now. The problem is that the intention versus the impact don't align. He meant well, but her feelings are hurt.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't share it with anyone and kept it private, which he thought was for her benefit. He's trying to remember things, and the notebook is a tool to help with that. Maybe the issue is more about communication. If he had shared the existence of the notebook with her before, she might have understood his intentions. But since she found out this way, it's a surprise, leading to mistrust.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, he didn't do anything malicious. He thought he was doing something sweet. But he might not have considered that keeping a detailed notebook could make her feel uncomfortable. Maybe the act of keeping such a record is intrusive, even if done with good intentions. It's possible that the wife's feelings are valid, and the author should have discussed this with her before keeping it a secret. So he might be in the wrong not because he's being bad, but because he didn't consider her perspective and kept something private that she found out in a hurtful way.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that keeping notes to remember important things is a positive gesture, and the wife is overreacting. But given that she feels betrayed, the author's action, while well-meaning, has caused hurt. He needs to validate her feelings and figure out a way to reconcile, maybe by explaining his intentions and adjusting how he handles such things in the future. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but he needs to be more considerate of how his actions are perceived.\n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. But the options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). The problem is that his actions, though well-intended, caused harm. So technically, is he in the wrong? If the harm wasn't intentional, maybe not. But he should have anticipated that keeping such a notebook might make her feel uneasy. So perhaps he did something that's a mistake, but not necessarily being in the wrong. The wife's reaction is valid, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's a communication issue. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe key is whether the action itself is wrong. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical. He's keeping notes to remember his wife's preferences. The problem arises because his wife feels betrayed. But does that make him wrong? It depends on the context of their relationship and their expectations. If the wife didn't know about the notebook and found out after the fact, it's possible that she didn't have the chance to voice her discomfort earlier. The author didn't lie or deceive; he just kept a private notebook. However, the existence of such a notebook might be seen as a breach of trust if it's discovered without prior discussion. But without malicious intent, maybe it's not the author's fault entirely. The wife's feelings are valid, but the author isn't in the wrong because he had no way of knowing her reaction. So the answer might be B. But some might argue that he should have considered that keeping such detailed notes could make her uncomfortable, hence A. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the answer is B because the author's intentions are good, and the issue is more about differing perspectives rather than a clear wrongdoing.\n"
