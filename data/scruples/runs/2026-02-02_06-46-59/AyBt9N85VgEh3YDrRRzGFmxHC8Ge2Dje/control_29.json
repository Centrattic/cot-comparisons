She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an \"Almanac\" where he writes down personal details about his wife. The situation is that his wife found out about it, felt betrayed, and they're now having some issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author started keeping notes because he wanted to remember important things about his wife, like her favorite things. He did this for years without showing it to anyone. Now, his wife is upset, calling it a \"playbook\" and feeling like he's cheapening the sweet things he does for her. She's even considering destroying the Almanac.\n\nSo, the question is whether he did something wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nLet me break it down. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember his wife's preferences to be a better partner. He kept it private, didn't share it with anyone. The problem arose when his wife discovered it and reacted negatively. The core issue is about consent and privacy. Even though his actions were well-meaning, did he overstep by keeping a private record of her personal information without her knowledge or consent?\n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. If the wife feels that having this document makes her feel like her partner is treating her as a project or using a \"playbook,\" that's a valid emotional response. The author didn't intend to make her feel that way, but her feelings are real. The act of keeping such detailed notes without her awareness might have crossed a line, even if done with good intentions.\n\nAnother angle is whether the Almanac is a personal memento or an invasion of privacy. The author wrote things she told him, which she shared in confidence. If she hadn't intended for him to document that, then he might have. However, in a relationship, sharing personal details with a partner is usually expected to be part of the relationship dynamics. But the key is how she perceives it now.\n\nThe wife's reaction is significant. She feels betrayed, even if he didn't have ulterior motives. Her feeling that the Almanac cheapens his gestures suggests that she values spontaneity and genuine memory over documented actions. If he had just remembered things naturally, maybe she wouldn't feel that way. But the existence of the document as a tool makes her feel like he's not genuinely caring, but rather using a strategy.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, maybe not in terms of malicious intent, but in terms of respecting her boundaries. Since she didn't know about the Almanac and now feels it's manipulative or insincere, his failure to consider her perspective might be the issue. Even if he didn't do anything wrong in his mind, relationships require mutual understanding. He should have discussed his reasons with her, maybe involved her in the process, or recognized that some things are better left un-documented.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his actions, though well-intentioned, caused her emotional distress without her consent. Since she's upset and it's affecting their relationship, the author might be in the wrong not because he's a bad person, but because he didn't consider her feelings about the method he used to remember things. The problem isn't the notes themselves but the lack of communication and how it's making her feel.\n"
