She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by keeping an almanac of personal notes about his wife. The situation is a bit nuanced.\n\nFirst, the author started the almanac to remember important details about his wife, like her favorite things and interests. His intention was to do sweet things for her, which seems genuine. He didn't tell anyone about it, and it was a personal way to keep track of things he didn't want to forget. That seems thoughtful and loving.\n\nHowever, his wife found out and felt hurt. She thought he remembered these things naturally, and the existence of the almanac made her feel like he was using a \"playbook\" to win points, which led to betrayal. The key here is the reaction of the wife. Even though the author's intention was good, the way the wife perceived it caused emotional distress.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author at fault here? Well, maybe not in terms of malicious intent. He didn't mean to make her feel that way. But maybe he should have considered her feelings about privacy or how she perceived his actions. Couples often have unspoken expectations about how things like remembering preferences are done. If she valued spontaneity or natural memory, his method of using a written list might have clashed with that.\n\nBut then again, keeping notes to remember important things isn't inherently wrong. It's a common way people ensure they don't forget important details. The issue seems to be more about the emotional impact rather than the action itself. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but the wife's feelings are valid. \n\nIn these situations, communication is key. The author might not have considered that his wife might see the notes as insincere, even if they were a genuine expression of love. However, the author's actions were not deceitful; he was trying to show love and attention in a way he thought was appropriate.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the wife's feelings are hurt, then maybe the author should have been more sensitive to her perspective. But since his intentions were good and there was no malice, perhaps the answer is that he's not in the wrong. The problem is more about differing expectations rather than the action itself being wrong.\n"
