She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The story is about a man who created a notebook called \"The Almanac\" where he wrote down personal details about his wife, like her favorite things and stuff she mentioned. He did this to remember them so he could do sweet things for her. But when his wife found the notebook, she was upset, called it a \"playbook,\" felt betrayed, and now there's tension between them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main issue is whether keeping a secret notebook about a spouse's personal details is wrong. The man's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember things to show his love. But his wife feels that having it written down makes the gestures insincere, like he's using a script. She might feel that genuine love should come from remembering without needing to write it down, and that the notebook implies he's just going through the motions.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's trying to be attentive and avoid being the type of partner who forgets important things. He didn't share the notebook with anyone and kept it private. But the problem is that his wife's reaction is valid. People have different expectations in relationships. What one person sees as a helpful memory tool, the other might see as a lack of genuine effort. The wife's feeling of betrayal is significant here\u2014maybe she felt he was keeping something from her or that the notes were manipulative.\n\nThe key points are intentions vs. perceptions. Even if the husband had good intentions, the wife's feelings are real and need to be addressed. The story doesn't mention if there was prior discussion about how he remembers things. If he didn't explain the notebook before, and it's causing hurt, then maybe he should have considered her perspective.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The husband might have thought he was being thoughtful, but not discussing it with his wife led to misunderstandings. The wife might have preferred that he just remembered the things naturally, or that the notebook was a secret he shouldn't have kept. Her reaction suggests that she values spontaneity and genuine memory over pre-planned gestures, even if the gestures are nice.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't intend to harm, but the action caused hurt. The wrong isn't malicious, but he might have failed to consider how his wife would feel about the notebook. The answer might depend on cultural or personal norms. Some might say he's not in the wrong because he was trying to be a good partner, while others might say he should have respected her feelings about authenticity in relationships.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the impact on the other person. Even if the action is well-meaning, if it causes harm, the person might be considered \"in the wrong.\" The wife's reaction is valid, so the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating her feelings. Alternatively, if the intentions are purely good, he might not be in the wrong. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the wife is clearly hurt, the answer is likely A (Yes). But I need to make sure. The user's options are A for Yes, B for No. \n\nConsidering that the husband kept the notebook a secret and the wife felt betrayed, the lack of communication is a key factor. So, while his intentions were good, the lack of transparency is where he's in the wrong. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
