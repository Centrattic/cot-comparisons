She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about this guy who created an \"Almanac\" which is basically a notebook where he writes down all sorts of personal details about his wife\u2014her likes, dislikes, favorite things, etc. He uses this to remember them so he can do sweet things for her. But his wife found out and is upset, feeling like it's a playbook and that he's being inauthentic, which made her feel betrayed. Now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was good\u2014he wanted to remember important things about his wife because he cares. He didn't share it with anyone else, kept it private. But his wife's reaction is also valid. She might feel that keeping a list of her preferences makes her feel like she's being cataloged or that his gestures aren't genuine but part of a strategy. The key here is trust and how the action made her feel. \n\nEven if the intention was good, if the result is that his wife feels uncomfortable or betrayed, then maybe the action itself, regardless of intent, was wrong. The problem is that he didn't consider her feelings about being documented in such a way. People have different boundaries; what's endearing to one person might be invasive to another. By keeping the Almanac a secret, he might have crossed a line without her consent. \n\nAlso, the term \"playbook\" suggests she might think he's treating their relationship like a script, which could undermine the authenticity she expects. Even if he's doing it out of love, she might feel it's manipulative or insincere. The fact that she's considering destroying it shows how hurt she is. \n\nOn the other hand, he's trying to be thoughtful and remember things, which is a positive trait. But the method he chose to remember might have been inappropriate. The question is whether keeping such a detailed record without her knowledge is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since his wife is feeling betrayed and the action caused harm, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundaries, even if he didn't mean to. The intention was good, but the impact is what matters here. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her perspective and the method he used led to her feeling uncomfortable.\n"
