She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about his wife. The situation involves the wife feeling betrayed and hurt when she discovers the notebook.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author created the almanac to remember important details about his wife, intending to use it to do sweet things for her. He never showed it to anyone and kept it private. However, the wife felt that this \"playbook\" cheapened his gestures and made her feel like he was just using a script, leading to betrayal.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus perception. The author's intent was genuine\u2014he wanted to remember her preferences because he loves her. But the wife's reaction is valid because she felt it reduced the authenticity of his actions. Even though he meant well, her feelings of betrayal suggest that his actions, though well-intentioned, may have been perceived as insincere or manipulative.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author didn't foresee how his partner might feel about having her personal details documented. It's possible that she values spontaneity and genuine effort over prepared gestures, which the almanac now represents to her. The fact that she hasn't decided whether to return it or destroy it shows the depth of her hurt.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of malicious intent, but he is responsible for not considering how his actions might affect her emotionally. It's about empathy and understanding her perspective. The wife's feelings are legitimate, and he needs to address them by apologizing and discussing how to move forward, respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though his intentions were good, he caused emotional harm by not considering his wife's feelings about the almanac. It's not just about right or wrong, but about how his actions impacted her relationship.\n"
