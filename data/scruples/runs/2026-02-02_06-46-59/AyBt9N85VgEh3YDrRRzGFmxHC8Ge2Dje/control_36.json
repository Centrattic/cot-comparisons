She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.\nI get a call from her around 11am. \"What the fuck is The Almanac?\" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.\nAITA here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for keeping an almanac of personal notes about his wife. The situation is that he started collecting details about her preferences, like her love for lilacs, favorite colors, etc., to remember and do sweet things for her. But now his wife is upset, feeling that the almanac has cheapened his gestures and that it's like a \"playbook,\" making her feel betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author's intention was good; he wanted to remember important things about his wife because he loves her. He mentions he wrote things down because he's forgetful and didn't want to be the guy who forgets stuff. That's a positive motivation.\n\nHowever, the issue here is the wife's reaction. She didn't know about the almanac until she found it. She feels betrayed and thinks he's using it as a playbook. The key points here are about trust and transparency. Even though his intentions were good, the fact that he didn't share this with her raises questions. Did he have a reason to keep it secret? The author says he never told anyone, not even his wife, and that it was a surprise. But maybe in a relationship, sharing such personal efforts is important for mutual understanding.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of privacy. The almanac contains personal information about her, which he collected without her knowledge. Even if it's for a good reason, collecting and keeping such a record without discussing it might be seen as an invasion of privacy, even if it's from her partner. Some might argue that it's okay because it's about her own preferences, but the way he used it (as a playbook) could be seen as manipulative, though he denies that.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is significant. She's hurt and feels that the notes have cheapened the gestures. This suggests that she values spontaneity and sincerity over planned, rehearsed actions. If she feels that he's just following a list, it might make her feel like his gestures aren't genuine. The author's frustration is that he wants to remember, but the method has caused hurt feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the method of keeping the almanac crossed a line, even with good intentions. Since the wife is upset and the author kept it secret, it's possible he is in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective on privacy and spontaneity. However, others might argue that his actions were well-meaning and that the fault lies in the wife's interpretation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both intentions and consequences. Here, the consequences are negative despite good intentions. The author's actions led to his wife feeling betrayed and the relationship being strained. Therefore, he might be at fault for not discussing this with her and for creating something that she now sees as undermining her feelings.\n"
