They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and during the sign-up process, they were asked about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the cleaning time. The user intentionally didn't list all the rooms they had, specifically to get a 4-hour cleaning time instead of the longer time the app would have suggested if they listed all the rooms. The cleaner arrived, finished the downstairs quickly, then went upstairs and got angry when he saw the extra rooms. The user told the cleaner upfront that only the downstairs was essential and that he could do the upstairs if he had time.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the user provide accurate information about the house size when booking the cleaner? The app uses the number of rooms to estimate time, so by lying about the number of rooms, the user might have set an expectation that the cleaner wouldn't be responsible for the extra rooms. However, the user didn't explicitly mention this during the booking. The cleaner, based on the listed rooms, expected to clean those and maybe the ones listed. When he found more rooms, he felt misled. \n\nThe user claims they only needed the cleaner for the downstairs, but since the booking process was based on room count, not specified areas, the user might have misled the cleaner. Even though they explained it at the start, the initial booking information didn't reflect the actual house size. The cleaner's job might be to clean the listed rooms in the time allocated, and if the user didn't list all rooms, the cleaner might feel entitled to not work extra beyond the listed tasks. The user might have breached the understanding by not being transparent about the house's full size upfront, even if they tried to explain it later. \n\nOn the other hand, the user tried to clarify the priorities at the beginning, but the cleaner's reaction suggests that the initial listing was a contract point. The user's action of lying about the number of rooms to get a shorter time slot could be seen as deceptive. Even if the user explained it again, the cleaner might feel that the contract was based on specific room counts, and the user didn't honor that, thus the user is in the wrong.\n"
