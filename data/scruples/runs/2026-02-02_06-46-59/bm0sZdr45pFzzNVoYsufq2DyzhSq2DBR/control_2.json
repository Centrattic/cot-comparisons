They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not listing the full size of the house when hiring a cleaner.\n\nFirst, the author used an app that requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the cleaning duration. The author intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a 4-hour cleaning window instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then took the remaining time to clean upstairs, but when shown more rooms, he got angry because the actual number was higher than listed.\n\nNow, the key points here are the terms of the service. If the app's pricing is based on the number of rooms, then listing fewer rooms to get a lower price might be a breach of the contract. The cleaner was hired for a specific amount of time based on the reported house size. If the app's terms state that the cleaner should only clean the listed rooms, then the author is in the wrong for not being honest. However, the author also told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and do as much of the upstairs as possible if time allows. The cleaner might have expected to clean only the listed rooms, so the unexpected additional rooms could be a problem. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling that they were misled about the scope of work, even though they had time left. The user might be violating the app's terms by misrepresenting the house size, which could justify the cleaner's frustration. On the other hand, if the app's pricing is per room, but the author paid for a 4-hour window, maybe the cleaner is overstepping by expecting to clean all listed rooms. But the author didn't list all rooms, so the cleaner might feel underpaid. It's a bit of a grey area, but the main issue is the dishonesty in the initial setup. The author didn't disclose all the rooms, which could lead to a misunderstanding. The answer might depend on the app's specific terms. However, in most service agreements, providing accurate information is essential. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for misleading the cleaner about the house size, even if they tried to manage expectations upon arrival.\n"
