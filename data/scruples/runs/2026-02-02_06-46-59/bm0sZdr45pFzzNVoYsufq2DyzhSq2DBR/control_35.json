They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying about the house size when hiring a cleaner. The situation is that the author hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms to get an hour estimate. They didn't list all the rooms to get a shorter, cheaper time, intending the cleaner to only clean the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author says the cleaner only needed to work the listed time and didn't have to finish everything upstairs.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the app's system uses room count to determine hours. The author intentionally provided false info to get a lower hour count, knowing the cleaner would have extra time. But when the cleaner used that time to clean the upstairs, which wasn't listed, the author didn't want them to do that. Wait, no\u2014the author told the cleaner to focus on downstairs and only do upstairs if time allows. But the cleaner was upset because the house had more rooms than listed, implying the author didn't disclose the actual size. \n\nThe cleaner might have expected that the listed rooms would be the only ones cleaned. If the app's system is based on the number of rooms to calculate required hours, then the author misrepresented the house size. The cleaner might have priced their time based on that. So the author got a cheaper rate by hiding the true size, but the cleaner ended up with more work than expected, leading to a conflict. \n\nThe author argues that the cleaner only needed to work the time paid for, not finish all the rooms. But the cleaner might feel that the terms were based on the listed rooms, so the extra time was for those. The author's deception (lying about the house size) could be the issue here. Even if the app's system uses room count for time, if the actual house has more rooms, the cleaner might expect that the time is for those listed rooms, and the rest are beyond the contract. But the author didn't tell the cleaner all the rooms upfront, leading to the cleaner feeling misled. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like the author intentionally misrepresented the house's size to get a lower price, leading to a misunderstanding. The cleaner might have been entitled to expect that the listed rooms were the only ones to be addressed. The author's actions could be seen as deceptive, so the answer might be A (Yes). But maybe the app's terms are not clear, and the author thought they could manage the cleaner's time. However, since the user misrepresented the property's size, that's a problem. The cleaner might have been overworked or underpaid if the time was based on a smaller house. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
