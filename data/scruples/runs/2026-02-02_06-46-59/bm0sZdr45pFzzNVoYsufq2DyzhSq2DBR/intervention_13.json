They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hired the cleaner is in the wrong. The situation is that the cleaner was told to clean the downstairs but was given a service based on a misrepresented number of rooms, leading to extra time. The cleaner got angry when they found out there were more rooms upstairs than listed.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the terms of the service agreement. The user intentionally lied about the house size to get a 4-hour cleaning package instead of the longer one the app would have suggested. The cleaner was supposed to work within that 4-hour window, but they finished quickly and then the user took them upstairs. The cleaner felt misled because the actual house size was bigger than what was listed.\n\nIf the app's pricing or service duration is based on the number of rooms, then the user is using a system designed to allocate time based on that info. By underreporting the rooms, they effectively got a longer service time for a cheaper rate. The cleaner might feel that they were paid less than what the job actually entails because the house has more rooms than listed. \n\nThe user says they didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs, but the cleaner was given a time slot that was based on a smaller house. So when they finished the downstairs quickly, the extra time could be used to start the upstairs. The user might not have considered that the app's algorithm determines how much time is appropriate for the house size. If the app was designed to charge based on the number of rooms, then not listing all of them is a form of deception. \n\nThe cleaner's reaction is justified if they believe they were misled about the scope of the job. The user is expecting the cleaner to work the full time but not charge extra for the larger house, which the app's system likely accounts for. The cleaner might have reserved the time based on the app's calculation, which was based on the incorrect info provided. \n\nAdditionally, the user's siblings are teenagers, so maybe they aren't fully aware of proper hiring practices. However, the service they used probably has clear terms that require accurate information. The user's argument is that they only paid for 4 hours and the cleaner should just work for that time, but the cleaner might feel they were underpaid for the actual potential workload. \n\nIn conclusion, the user's act of misrepresenting the house size to get a cheaper rate is a breach of trust and terms of service. The cleaner has a valid reason to be upset because their compensation is tied to the expected workload, which was misrepresented. So the answer is A.\n"
