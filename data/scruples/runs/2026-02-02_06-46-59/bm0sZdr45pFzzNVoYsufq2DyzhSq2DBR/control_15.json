They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who hired the cleaner did something wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, they used an app to hire a cleaner. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the cleaning time. The user intentionally lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour rate instead of a longer one, even though there are more rooms upstairs. Their main goal was to clean the downstairs thoroughly, which they considered important.\n\nWhen the cleaner arrived, they reiterated that the focus should be on the downstairs and that the cleaner could do the upstairs if there was extra time. However, the cleaner worked quickly and finished the downstairs in 90 minutes, leaving time to clean the upstairs. But the cleaner got upset because the actual number of rooms was higher than listed, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering the terms of service of the app, it's likely that when you list the number of rooms, the cleaner expects to clean all those rooms within the quoted time. If the user provided incorrect information, the cleaner might feel misled. Even if the user explained the focus at the start, the contract or agreement was based on false premises. The cleaner probably followed the app's instructions, which were based on the user's inaccurate input. So, the user's deception could be at fault here.\n\nBut wait, maybe the app's terms allow for the user to specify which areas are prioritized. If the app's process is to let the user choose rooms, but the user misused the room count input to get a lower hourly rate, that's a problem. The cleaner might have been under the impression that they had to clean all listed rooms, so the user's dishonesty in listing the house size is the issue. The user might have breached the contract by not providing accurate information, leading to the cleaner's justified frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, if the app's system isn't clear about whether the room listing is about the number of rooms to clean or just to estimate time, the user might be in a gray area. But since the user intentionally lied, that's probably not the case here. The cleaner's anger stems from the discrepancy between what was listed and the actual work expected. Even if the user asked the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the cleaner was hired based on the premise of a smaller house. The extra time could be because the cleaner was efficient, but the user's initial deception is the root of the problem.\n\nSo, the user is likely in the wrong because they provided misleading information when booking, which the cleaner relied on. Even if the user tried to clarify at the start, the contract was based on false premises. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
