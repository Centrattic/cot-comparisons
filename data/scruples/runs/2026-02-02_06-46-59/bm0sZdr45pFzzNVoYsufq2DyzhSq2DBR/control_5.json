They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires listing the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author lied about the number to get a 4-hour service, knowing that the cleaner wouldn't need to do the upstairs. But the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset about the upstairs not being listed. The author told the cleaner they didn't have to do all the rooms, just what they had time for, but the cleaner was angry.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author misrepresented the house size to get a cheaper or shorter service. The contract was based on the app's algorithm using the number of rooms to determine hours. By falsifying that, the author didn't provide accurate information. The cleaner was probably expecting a house with fewer rooms, so when they saw more rooms, they felt misled. Even though the author tried to clarify that the upstairs wasn't necessary, the cleaner might have felt they were entitled to only the time allocated for the listed rooms. The author might have breached the service agreement by providing false information, leading to a situation where the cleaner had more work than anticipated. The cleaner's anger could be due to feeling that the author tricked them into working more than they were paid for, even if the author didn't make them do all the upstairs. So, the author is in the wrong because they misrepresented the job requirements, which is a breach of trust and the service terms. The cleaner's right to be paid for the time they were contracted for, and the author's deception could lead to the cleaner working extra without compensation. Therefore, answer A.\n"
