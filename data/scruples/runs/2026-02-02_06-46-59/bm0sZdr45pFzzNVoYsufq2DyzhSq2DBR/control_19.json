They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who hired the cleaner is in the wrong. The situation is that they used an app to hire a cleaner for their parents' house. They lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a specific number of hours. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got angry when they showed him the extra rooms upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, there's usually an agreement based on the information you provide. If the app calculates the hours based on the number of rooms, then providing false information would mean the contract isn't based on the actual premises. The cleaner might have expected to clean a certain number of rooms based on the listing, so when there are more, they feel misled.\n\nThe user argues that they told the cleaner they didn't have to finish everything upstairs and that only the downstairs was important. But the cleaner might feel that the initial listing was deceptive, leading them to believe they were being paid for a specific amount of work that didn't match the actual task. Even if the user gave instructions upon arrival, the initial misrepresentation could be the root of the problem. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling they were promised a certain workload but got more than expected without additional compensation.\n\nAlso, the app's terms probably require accurate information from the user. By lying about the house size, the user violated that, which could mean they were in the wrong. Even if the cleaner didn't mind in the end, the initial deception is the issue. The user might also be responsible for ensuring the cleaner's work aligns with the contract, which was based on false premises.\n\nOn the other hand, the user did clarify the priorities when the cleaner arrived, so maybe the cleaner should have adjusted their work accordingly. However, the cleaner might have felt entitled to work the full time paid for, especially if they believed the task would take longer based on the initial listing. The user's complaint about the cleaner's attitude is valid, but if the user provided incorrect info, they might share some responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the user provided false information to get a lower price, which led to a misunderstanding. Even though they gave instructions later, the initial deception makes them at least partially responsible. So the answer is A (the user is in the wrong).\n"
