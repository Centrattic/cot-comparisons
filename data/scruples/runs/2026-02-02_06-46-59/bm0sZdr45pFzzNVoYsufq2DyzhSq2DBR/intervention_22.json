They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about hiring a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms and bathrooms to get an hour estimate. The author intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a 4-hour cleaner, but the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then got upset about not cleaning the upstairs as per the listed rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the number of rooms and bathrooms, then the user is supposed to list all the rooms they want cleaned. By not doing so, the user misled the app's algorithm. Even if the cleaner wasn't explicitly told to clean upstairs, the contract (via the app) might have been based on the false information. \n\nThe cleaner might have expected to clean the entire house as listed. Even if the user explained that upstairs wasn't necessary, the contract might have been for a 4-hour job based on the actual size, which would mean the cleaner was entitled to work the full time. The user might have known that if they listed the correct number of rooms, the cleaner would have been scheduled for more hours, but they wanted to save money. \n\nThe cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that their time was wasted or that the user's deception affected their work. Even if the user clarified their wishes, the initial setup was misleading. The app probably expects users to accurately represent the scope of work. So, the user's action was deceptive, which could be considered wrong. However, maybe the app's terms don't strictly enforce that, but ethically, the user is in the wrong for not being honest about the house size. The cleaner trusted the listed information and might have planned accordingly. The user's decision to underreport rooms led to a mismatch in expectations.\n"
