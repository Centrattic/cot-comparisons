They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person hired a cleaner through an app by inputting fewer bedrooms and bathrooms than the actual house has. The app calculated a 4-hour job based on that info. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the extra rooms, he got angry because the house is bigger than listed. The author thought the cleaner only needed to do the downstairs and whatever time allowed for upstairs.\n\nSo, the key points: The app's pricing is based on the number of rooms. The customer lied about the size to get a cheaper rate. The cleaner was hired for a specific duration based on that info. The cleaner didn't know there were more rooms until after finishing the downstairs. The author tried to explain that the extra time is flexible, but the cleaner was upset.\n\nLegally, if the contract (through the app) is based on the listed rooms, the customer misrepresented the job size. The cleaner might have expected only those rooms listed. Even if the customer tried to clarify on-site, the initial deception could be an issue. The author didn't disclose all the rooms upfront, leading to misunderstanding. The cleaner's anger is about being misled, not just about the workload. The author might be in the wrong because they intentionally provided false info to get a lower price, not considering the cleaner's expectations set by the app's system. So, answer A.\n"
