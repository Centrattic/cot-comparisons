They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and to get a 4-hour booking, they lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The actual house has more upstairs rooms than listed, so the cleaner expected to clean a certain amount but now has time left and the author didn't want them to clean the entire upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours, right? So if you list more rooms, you get more hours. The author intentionally underreported to get a shorter, cheaper 4-hour window. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then the author showed him the upstairs, but the cleaner was upset because the actual number of rooms is higher. \n\nThe key points here: the author misrepresented the house size, which affected the cleaner's compensation. The app's system is set up so that more rooms mean more hours. If the author's house has more bedrooms and bathrooms, but they didn't list them, the app's calculation is flawed. The cleaner might have been paid based on the assumption that they were handling a certain amount of work. By not listing all the rooms, the author might have effectively underpaid the cleaner. \n\nThen the cleaner was angry because the actual work wasn't what was agreed upon. The author told the cleaner they didn't have to finish all the upstairs if he ran out of time, but the cleaner's main issue is that the task was misrepresented. So even if the author is okay with the cleaner not doing all the work, the problem is that the cleaner gave time not accounted for in the contract (since the app's hours are based on the listed rooms). \n\nThe author's argument is that they only hired for the time they had, and the cleaner was supposed to do as much as possible in that time. However, the cleaner's expectation was probably based on the listed rooms. If the house is bigger than listed, even if the author doesn't want the cleaner to do all the work, the cleaner might feel that they were promised a certain scope for their time. \n\nAlso, the author's parents are strict about cleanliness, so the family wanted the downstairs to be perfect. But by not being honest, they might have exploited the cleaner's time. The cleaner might have been under the impression that the 4 hours were for a specific number of rooms, and now the author is asking them to work more without additional payment. \n\nIn terms of ethics, lying to get a cheaper rate and then expecting the cleaner to use their time as they see fit in a larger space could be seen as unfair. The cleaner's job was to clean the listed rooms in the time allocated, but the author's house is larger than that. If the cleaner had known the actual size, they might have priced it higher. So the author didn't just cut the cleaner off from doing the extra work; they also misrepresented the job's scope. \n\nThe author might not have realized the implications of how the app works. The app's model is based on the number of rooms to determine hours. By lying, they manipulated the system, which could be considered unethical. Even if the app's terms don't explicitly state that the cleaner must clean exactly the listed rooms, the cleaner's experience would be that the app's estimate is based on that info. \n\nAlso, the cleaner's reaction of anger suggests that the misrepresentation directly affected their ability to perform their job as expected. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't provide accurate information when booking, leading to a misunderstanding about the job's scope and compensation. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the app's terms allow for the user to direct the cleaner on what to clean, but that's not clear. If the app's contract is between the user and the cleaner, and it's based on the listed rooms, then the author is responsible for the accuracy of that information. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions could be seen as deceptive. They got a lower price by not being truthful, which might have resulted in the cleaner being underpaid for the actual work. The cleaner was within their rights to be upset if the app's pricing model is tied to the number of rooms. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not listing the correct number of rooms.\n"
