They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of their house to get a lower price. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours, and the author didn't list all the bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour booking instead of a longer one. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but the author had only wanted the downstairs cleaned. The cleaner got angry and the author is now considering complaining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, there are usually terms and conditions. The app probably calculates the hours based on the number of rooms to ensure the cleaner can do the job within that time. If the author didn't list all the rooms, they might have violated the app's rules. The cleaner might have expected that the listed rooms would take the full 4 hours, so if they finished early and there's more to clean, the author could be seen as deceptive. \n\nBut the author did explain upfront that the downstairs was the priority and the upstairs could be done if time allowed. The cleaner might have been under the impression that the 4 hours was enough for all listed rooms, not that there were more. So when they found out there were additional rooms, they felt misled. The author's intention was to save money by not listing all rooms, but the cleaner's contract might be based on the listed rooms, meaning the author should have paid for the actual size of the house. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did clarify that the cleaner doesn't have to finish everything, just the downstairs. The cleaner might have been upset because they expected the listed rooms to take the full allocated time, and now there's leftover time but more rooms. The author could argue that they were upfront once the cleaner arrived, even if their initial listing was incomplete. However, the cleaner might still feel that the initial deception affected their ability to manage their time or the job expectations. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author mislead the cleaner by not listing all rooms? The app's system is based on the number of rooms to determine hours. If the author didn't list all rooms, they might have manipulated the system to get a cheaper rate, which is unethical. But the cleaner's job was to clean the listed rooms within the given time. If the author didn't list all rooms, the cleaner isn't obligated to do the unlisted ones. However, the cleaner might have thought the 4 hours was sufficient for the listed rooms, so the leftover time was unexpected. The author might be in the wrong for not being honest from the start, even though they tried to clarify later. The cleaner's anger could stem from the feeling that they were wronged by the initial false listing, even if the author was clear once the job started. \n\nIn terms of strict rules, if the app's policy requires accurate room counts to determine the hours, the author broke that. The cleaner was paid for a 4-hour job, and if the author provided a house larger than what they listed, the cleaner could feel exploited. The best practice is to be honest when using such apps because the pricing and time are based on the information provided. The author's intention was to save money, but the cleaner's time and effort were based on the initial details. Even if the author said the cleaner didn't have to finish the upstairs, the initial deception could be the root of the problem. \n\nSo, the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for not listing the full size, which is against the app's system and could be seen as misleading the cleaner. However, the author did clarify the priorities once the cleaner arrived. The cleaner's reaction might be a bit strong, but the author's initial dishonesty could be the main issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
