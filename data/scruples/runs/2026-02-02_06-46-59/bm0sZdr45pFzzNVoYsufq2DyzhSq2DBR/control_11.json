They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by not telling the cleaner the full size of the house when booking through an app. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author only listed the downstairs areas to get a 4-hour cleaning session, even though the actual house has more rooms upstairs. The cleaner got angry because he expected to clean only what was listed, but the author wanted him to focus on the downstairs and use any remaining time for the upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app's structure is such that the hours are based on the number of rooms listed. If the user inputted fewer rooms to get a lower price, that's a problem. The cleaner might have been paid based on the listed rooms, and if the actual work required more time than anticipated, the author might be underpaying the cleaner. But in this case, the author paid for 4 hours, and the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly, so the extra time was used for the upstairs. The cleaner's issue is that the house is bigger than listed, but the user told him to focus on the downstairs and do as much as he could with the remaining time.\n\nThe key points here are transparency and fair compensation. The user intentionally misled the app about the house size to save money, which could be considered unethical. The cleaner might have been expecting only the listed rooms, but the user tried to get more work done without additional payment. Even though the user told the cleaner to prioritize the downstairs, the initial misrepresentation about the house size could be the root of the problem. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling that the user tricked him into working on areas he wasn't paid for. However, since the user paid for the full 4 hours, and the cleaner had the option to decline the work, maybe the user isn't entirely at fault. But the user's intent to hide the true size to get a cheaper rate might still be wrong. The app's process is designed to estimate hours based on room count, so not being honest there could lead to misunderstandings. The author might be in the wrong for misleading the app and the cleaner about the house's actual size. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a way the user isn't at fault. If the app's terms allow for flexibility or if the user made it clear during the session, maybe not. But the main issue is the initial false input. So, probably A."
