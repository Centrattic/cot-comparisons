They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app. The user lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour cleaning service instead of the longer time the app would have suggested with the actual number of rooms. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and was upset about the extra rooms upstairs, even after being told he didn't have to finish everything.\n\nSo, first, the key points here. The app probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the time needed. By providing incorrect info, the user got a cleaner who was sent for a job that, according to the app's calculation, should take 4 hours. But the actual house is bigger. The cleaner did the downstairs in 90 minutes, then found out there are more rooms, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user's defense is that they only wanted the downstairs cleaned and told the cleaner he didn't have to finish the upstairs. The cleaner was angry. The user is now considering a complaint because of the cleaner's attitude.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, when you use an app that asks for specific details to calculate the service time, providing false information could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner was hired based on the premise that the house had a certain number of rooms. If the actual house is bigger, the cleaner might feel they were misled. Even if the user told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the initial setup was based on incorrect premises. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed rooms within the 4 hours, but the house is actually bigger. The user didn't inform the cleaner of the discrepancy before the job started. So the user misrepresented the job's scope, which could be the root of the cleaner's anger.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue they only wanted that part cleaned and made that clear. But the app's system is designed to allocate time based on the input. If the user didn't follow the app's process correctly, leading to an underestimation, that's their responsibility. The cleaner's job is to clean the listed rooms within the paid time. If the house is larger than listed, the cleaner isn't obligated to clean the unlisted areas unless the user pays extra. However, the user didn't list the real size, so the cleaner might feel they were underpaid for the actual work. Wait, but the user paid for 4 hours based on the false input. The cleaner might have expected that 4 hours would cover the listed rooms. If the house is bigger, the time required would be more, but the user paid less. So the cleaner's frustration is about being mislead into undercharging for the actual work.\n\nSo, the user's action of providing incorrect information to get a lower price is deceptive. The cleaner was entitled to clean the rooms listed in the job. When the user added unlisted rooms, that's outside the agreed scope. The user should have either listed the correct number of rooms (and paid accordingly) or communicated the discrepancy before the cleaner started. Since they didn't, the user is in the wrong. The cleaner's anger is justified because the user misrepresented the job details, leading to potential underpayment and unexpected workload.\n"
