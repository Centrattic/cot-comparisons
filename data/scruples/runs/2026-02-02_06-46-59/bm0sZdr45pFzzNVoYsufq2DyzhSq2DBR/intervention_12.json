They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app where you select the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, which determines the hours. The author lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour cleaner, intending for them to only clean the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly, had time left, and then the author showed them the upstairs, which had more rooms than listed. The cleaner got angry, and the author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The app's system is based on inputting the number of rooms to calculate the time. The author intentionally provided false information to get a shorter time, expecting the cleaner to do only the downstairs. However, the cleaner might have based their work on the listed rooms, expecting to clean only those. When the author showed more rooms, the cleaner felt misled because the contract was based on the initial information. \n\nThe author argues that they told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and do as much as possible upstairs. But the cleaner's job, according to the app's terms, might require them to clean the listed rooms. If the author didn't list all the rooms, the cleaner might have been hired under the assumption that they only needed to clean the listed ones. The author's misrepresentation led to the cleaner working on unlisted areas, which the cleaner wasn't contracted for. This could be seen as a breach of trust or contract. \n\nAdditionally, the cleaner's time is part of the agreement. The app's pricing is tied to the number of rooms. By reducing the listed rooms, the author paid less, which might not cover the time the cleaner spent on unlisted areas. The cleaner might feel exploited because their time was undervalued. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known if the cleaner would finish early. They tried to be flexible, allowing the cleaner to do as much as possible. But the issue is whether the initial misrepresentation was the core problem. If the app's system is designed to match room count to time, then the author's deception directly affected the cleaner's expectations and compensation. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's actions could be seen as dishonest. They misrepresented the house's size to save money, then expected the cleaner to do more work without additional payment. The cleaner's anger is a reaction to being misled, which is valid. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for providing false information and not compensating the cleaner for the additional work they did beyond the agreed-upon scope. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
