They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of their house to get a lower price. The cleaner ended up having extra time after cleaning the downstairs and then got angry when shown the upstairs, which wasn't listed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author didn't list all the rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The app's system uses the number of rooms to determine the hours. By underreporting, they got a 4-hour booking. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly, so there was time left. The author then took the cleaner upstairs, but the cleaner was upset because the actual house was bigger than listed.\n\nNow, considering the rules of such services. Usually, when you hire through an app, the pricing is based on the information you provide. If you misrepresent the size, that could be a breach of the service's terms. The cleaner's contract or agreement might be based on the listed rooms. The author didn't inform the cleaner beforehand about the unlisted rooms, which might be a problem. Even though they told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the initial listing was false. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed areas and not be surprised by additional rooms that weren't mentioned.\n\nAlso, the author's explanation that the cleaner only needs to work the agreed hours might not absolve them. The cleaner might feel that the hours were based on the premise of the listed rooms. If the app's pricing is tied to the number of rooms, the author is essentially getting a cheaper service by not listing all rooms, but then expecting the cleaner to use the remaining time to clean the unlisted areas, which wasn't part of the original agreement.\n\nThe cleaner's anger could stem from feeling deceived. Even if the author only wanted the downstairs, the initial information was misleading. The service might have a strict policy on accurate listing to ensure proper pricing and expectations. The author might be in the wrong for not being transparent, even if their intention was to save money and only use the cleaner for a part of the house.\n\nAnother angle: the app's terms probably require accurate information. By lying, the author violated that. The cleaner might not have a legal claim, but ethically, the author misrepresented the house size. The cleaner's job was based on the listed rooms, and the author added more work without adjusting the payment. Even if the cleaner had time left, the author's deception is the root of the issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they provided false information leading to a mispriced service and then expected the cleaner to do more without additional compensation. The cleaner's job was based on the listed rooms, and the author's lack of transparency breached that agreement.\n"
