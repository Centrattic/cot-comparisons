They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a lower price. The app calculates the hours based on the number of rooms, so they didn't list all the bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour job. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when he saw the extra rooms, he got angry because the author didn't list them all.\n\nFirst, the author didn't tell the truth about the house's size. That's a problem because when you use a service like that, you're supposed to provide accurate information. The app's pricing is based on the input, so if they didn't include all the rooms, they essentially cheated the system to get a cheaper rate. That's probably the main issue here.\n\nThen, when the cleaner arrived, the author explained that only the downstairs was important and he could do the upstairs if he had time. The cleaner did the downstairs quickly and then took the opportunity to clean the upstairs, but when he realized there were more rooms than listed, he got upset. The cleaner might feel that the author misled him, so he's angry about being shortchanged on the job. But the author only paid for 4 hours, and the cleaner worked the full time. However, the problem is that the app's calculation is based on the number of rooms, so the cleaner might expect that the listed rooms are the only ones to be cleaned. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they misrepresented the house's size, which is a form of deception. Even if they told the cleaner the focus was downstairs, the initial contract was based on false premises. The app's system is designed to estimate the time needed based on the number of rooms. If they didn't list all the rooms, they might be responsible for the discrepancy. The cleaner might feel entitled to either more time or compensation, but since the author only paid for 4 hours, the cleaner can't really claim extra pay. However, the cleaner's anger might stem from the fact that the author tricked him into working on a house that's larger than what was listed, even if he didn't have to finish everything. \n\nThe key points are: the author lied about the house size to get a lower price, which is dishonest. The cleaner might not be obligated to clean beyond the listed rooms, but the author's deception is the root of the problem. The cleaner's reaction is probably about being misled, even if the author only used the 4 hours. So, the author is in the wrong for misrepresenting the house's size. They should have either listed the correct number of rooms and paid the higher rate or communicated differently. So the answer is A.\n"
