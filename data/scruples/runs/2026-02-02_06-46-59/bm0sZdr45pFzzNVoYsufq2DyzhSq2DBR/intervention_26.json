They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where they input the number of rooms to get an estimated hour allocation. They lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a shorter, cheaper estimate. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and was upset about the upstairs not being listed.\n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty in service contracts. When you use a service like this, you're typically expected to provide accurate information so the service provider can estimate the required time and effort. By misrepresenting the number of rooms, the user essentially got a lower price based on false premises. The cleaner, having been allocated hours based on that info, now finds that there's more work to do than they were paid for, leading to frustration.\n\nThe user argues that they only needed the cleaner for the downstairs and the cleaner was told to do as much as possible. However, the cleaner's contract (as per the app's terms) would have been based on the provided details. The user's deception might mean they got a subpar service for the upstairs since the cleaner was rushed or didn't have enough time to do a proper job. Also, the cleaner's time was underpaid because the user manipulated the system.\n\nEven though the user tried to communicate the focus on the downstairs upon arrival, the initial deception is problematic. The cleaner's anger is understandable because they were misled about the scope of work. In most service agreements, accurate information is crucial. The user might be in the wrong for not being truthful, leading to a situation where the cleaner is unfairly compensated for the work they did.\n"
