They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original story is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner using an app where you input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get the hours. The user lied about the number to get a 4-hour window, thinking only the downstairs needed cleaning. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but there were more rooms than listed, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user didn't list the actual number of rooms, which the app uses to determine the hours. They wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, which was the priority. The cleaner finished early and then went upstairs but found more rooms than expected. The cleaner got angry because of the discrepancy.\n\nThe user argues that they only needed the cleaner for the time they hired them, and they emphasized that the downstairs was the priority. The cleaner, however, felt misled because the app's terms might require cleaning all listed rooms. The app probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the required time, so if you list fewer rooms, you get fewer hours, and vice versa. By providing incorrect info, the user might have set up an unfair expectation for the cleaner.\n\nNow, thinking about ethics and fairness. The user manipulated the app's system to get a lower price by underreporting rooms. The cleaner's work hours were based on that info. When the cleaner finished early, they might have expected to finish all the listed rooms. But the user didn't list all the rooms, so the cleaner wasn't aware of the extra work. However, the user did inform the cleaner about the priority on the downstairs and that they could do what they can. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling that the user didn't honor the app's terms by not providing accurate info.\n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, if the app requires accurate input to determine the service scope, then the user breached that by lying. The cleaner's job was to clean the listed rooms within the hours given. If the user didn't list all rooms, the contract was based on false premises. The user's responsibility was to provide accurate info when using the app. Even if the user explained the priority, the initial misrepresentation could be the root of the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that they made it clear the priority was downstairs and that the cleaner could do as much as possible. The cleaner might have assumed that the listed rooms included all areas, leading to confusion. But the user's manipulation of the system to get a cheaper rate by lying about the house size is problematic. It's a bit of a gray area, but the user's initial deception could have caused the misunderstanding.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user is in the wrong because they provided inaccurate information to the app, which affected the service terms. Even if the cleaner was being difficult, the user's actions set up the situation. They should have either listed the accurate rooms and accepted the higher cost or communicated clearly from the start. The cleaner's anger is partly due to the user's misrepresentation. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
