They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying about the house size when hiring a cleaner. The author hired a cleaner through an app where the app determines the hours based on the number of rooms listed. The author didn't list all the rooms to get a shorter time (4 hours), which allowed the cleaner to finish the downstairs quickly and then he went upstairs, but got angry when he found out there were more rooms than listed.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty in the contract and expectations. The app's system is designed to estimate hours based on the size of the house. If the author didn't list the actual number of rooms, they manipulated the system to get a lower price. The cleaner probably expected that the time quoted (4 hours) was based on the accurate number of rooms. But the author intentionally withheld information to get a shorter time. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then was expected to stop, but he was upset because he felt he was misled about the house's size.\n\nThe author did tell the cleaner that he didn't have to finish the upstairs, but the cleaner's job might have been based on the assumption that the time quoted would be sufficient for the listed size. By not listing all rooms, the author might have set up a situation where the cleaner felt underpaid for the work he could have done if the hours were correctly estimated. Also, the app's pricing model is likely tied to the actual size to ensure fair pricing. The author might be exploiting the system by underreporting, which could lead to the cleaner not being paid for the full scope of work if he had to clean the entire house.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author did specify that the cleaner only needed to focus on the downstairs and could do as much as time allows for the upstairs. The problem is whether the cleaner's contract was based on a specific amount of work or just the time. If the app's service is hourly, then the author paid for 4 hours of work, and the cleaner did that work. The issue is that the cleaner felt wronged because the house was larger than listed, but the author didn't use the cleaner for the entire time. However, the cleaner might have expected that the time would be sufficient for the actual size of the house. The author's deception in listing the house size could be seen as unethical, even if the cleaner ended up not working the full time.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author intentionally lied to reduce the cost, which might be the main issue. The cleaner was misled about the actual work required, which could lead to dissatisfaction and the feeling of being cheated. Even if the cleaner didn't complete the work in the given time, the initial deception is problematic. So, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
