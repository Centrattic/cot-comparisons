They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about hiring a cleaner. The key points are:\n\nThe author hired a cleaner using an app, which requires inputting the number of rooms to determine the hours. They intentionally understated the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour job, even though the house actually has more. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and went upstairs, but got upset when they found out there are more rooms than listed. The author told the cleaner upfront that only the downstairs was critical and to do upstairs only if time permits. The cleaner was angry and felt wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app uses the number of rooms to calculate the hours, then providing incorrect information might be a breach of the service agreement. The app's pricing model likely assumes that the number of rooms corresponds to the time needed. By lying, the author might be underpaying for the actual work required, even if the cleaner finishes quickly.\n\nSecond, the cleaner's job might be based on the assumption that the listed rooms are the only ones to be cleaned. If the app's system is designed such that the number of rooms directly determines the scope, then the cleaner might have a right to be upset because they were hired under a misunderstanding. The author's initial instruction to focus on the downstairs could still be valid, but the discrepancy in the number of rooms might have led to an unfair expectation.\n\nThird, the author's intent was to have the cleaner focus on the downstairs and not the upstairs. However, the cleaner might have expected that the time allocated (based on the correct room count) would be sufficient for the tasks they were hired to do. If the app's algorithm is tied to the room count, the author's misrepresentation could lead to an incomplete job or unfair compensation.\n\nAnother angle: the cleaner's reaction might be about feeling misled. Even if the author verbally clarified upon arrival, the initial input on the app was inaccurate. The cleaner might feel that the app's process is about transparency, and the author's deception invalidates the agreement. The cleaner's anger could stem from the feeling that their work isn't being properly compensated, as they might have expected more hours for a larger house.\n\nHowever, the author paid for the time the cleaner worked. If the cleaner only worked the 4 hours and the author didn't charge them for extra time, maybe there's no financial loss. But the cleaner might have based their pricing on the initial room count, expecting that those rooms would be their main tasks. If the actual house is bigger, but the author didn't disclose that, the cleaner might feel their expertise is being compromised.\n\nAlso, the app's terms probably require accurate information. The author violated that, leading to a potential breach of service agreement. The cleaner could argue that they were hired under false pretenses, even if the author didn't ask them to do more than the paid hours.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to have the cleaner focus only on the downstairs, which they did. The cleaner had the choice to stop after the 4 hours, but might have felt pressured or misled to do more. However, the author's verbal instructions were clear. But if the app's system is designed to account for all listed rooms, then the author's input was misleading, leading to a mismatch.\n\nIn conclusion, the author misrepresented the house's size when booking, which is a form of dishonesty. Even if the cleaner only worked the paid hours, the initial misrepresentation could be considered wrong because it's based on the app's terms and the cleaner's expectations. The author might be in the wrong for not being transparent, leading to the cleaner's frustration.\n"
