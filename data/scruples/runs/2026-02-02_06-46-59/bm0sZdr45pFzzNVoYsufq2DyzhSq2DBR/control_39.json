They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer one. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs where he got angry because there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, the user didn't list all the bedrooms and bathrooms, which probably skewed the app's calculation of the required hours. The app's system likely uses the number of rooms to estimate time. By underreporting, the user got a shorter time than the cleaner expected. The cleaner might have been paid for a longer job if the actual size was listed, but since the user manipulated the inputs, that's an issue.\n\nThe user also explicitly told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs, but the cleaner was upset because the house was bigger than listed. The problem here is whether the user misrepresented the job scope intentionally. The user's main goal was to have the cleaner focus on the downstairs, but by not being honest about the house size, they might have created an expectation that the cleaner wasn't prepared for.\n\nThe cleaner's anger could stem from feeling misled. Even though the user told him to do as much as possible, the initial listing might have implied a certain scope. The app's process probably ties the service duration to the listing details. If the user manipulated that, they might be in the wrong because they didn't provide accurate information, leading to a mismatch in expectations.\n\nHowever, the user did clarify the focus areas when the cleaner arrived, so maybe the cleaner should have known to adjust. But cleaners usually rely on the listing to plan their work. The user's actions might have set up the cleaner for frustration because he had to deal with extra rooms without proper compensation or time.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about honesty. The user misrepresented the house size to get a cheaper or shorter service, which isn't fair to the cleaner who might have expected to work on all listed rooms. Even if the user intended to limit the cleaner to downstairs, the initial listing was misleading. So the user is in the wrong for not providing accurate information, leading to the cleaner's confusion and anger.\n\nSo, answer A.\n"
