They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires you to input the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list all the rooms because they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the additional rooms, he got angry because the author didn't list them all. The author told the cleaner he didn't have to finish everything upstairs, just do what he can in the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, there are usually terms and conditions. If the app's system is designed to calculate the time based on the number of rooms, then not providing accurate information could be against those terms. The cleaner might have been hired under the assumption that he's being paid for a certain amount of work based on the listed rooms. If the author didn't list all rooms, they might have misled the cleaner about the scope of the job.\n\nAlso, the contract here is between the user and the service. The app likely sets the price and time based on the information given. The author could be seen as manipulating the system to get a lower price by underreporting the rooms. The cleaner might have a right to be upset because he's being paid for a job that's larger than what was initially agreed upon. Even if the author mentioned that the upstairs wasn't necessary, the cleaner might have expected to work only on the listed areas for the agreed hours.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have thought they were saving money by not listing all rooms, but the cleaner's time is part of the agreement. If he finished the downstairs quickly, maybe it's because he's efficient, but the unlisted rooms could have added more work. The cleaner might feel that the author is trying to get more work out of him without extra pay.\n\nHowever, the author did inform the cleaner at the start that the downstairs was the priority and the upstairs was optional. If the cleaner agreed to that, maybe the issue is more about the initial misrepresentation than the actual work done. The app's terms might require accurate information, so the author violated those by providing false data. But from a moral standpoint, if the cleaner was willing to do the extra work (as he had time left), maybe it's a different story.\n\nBut the problem here is the initial deception. The cleaner might have been paid for a job that they expected to take 4 hours based on certain room counts, but the actual job was larger. The author didn't inform the app or the cleaner about the actual size, which could be considered dishonest. The cleaner might have a right to be angry because they were misled about the job's scope.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the app's system is supposed to handle the time based on the inputs. By lying about the number of rooms, the author created a discrepancy. The cleaner might feel that the author is exploiting the system and their time. Even if the author tried to adjust in real-time by telling the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the initial misrepresentation is a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author did mislead the cleaner and the app by not providing accurate information. The cleaner's anger is about being misled, even if the author tried to clarify during the service. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size when hiring the cleaner.\n"
