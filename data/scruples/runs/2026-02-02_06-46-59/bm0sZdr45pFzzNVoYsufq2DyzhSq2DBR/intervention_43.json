They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by lying about the size of the house when hiring a cleaner through an app. The author only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs areas, so they input fewer bedrooms and bathrooms to get a lower hourly rate. The cleaner finished quickly and then was upset when shown more rooms upstairs, even though the author had explained that the upstairs wasn't as important and the cleaner could prioritize the downstairs.\n\nFirst, the key point is the discrepancy between what was listed and the actual house size. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours, so the author intentionally misled the system. This could be seen as deceptive because they didn't provide accurate information, which might have resulted in a longer booking if the truth was told. The cleaner was probably expecting to clean a certain number of rooms based on the listing, so when presented with more, they felt it was a betrayal of the agreed terms.\n\nHowever, the author did clarify upon the cleaner's arrival that the focus should be on the downstairs and the upstairs was optional. The cleaner's anger seems to stem from the discrepancy in the listing rather than the instructions given on-site. The question is whether the service agreement is based on the listed rooms or the actual hours worked. If the app's terms state that the listed rooms determine the scope of work, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the cleaner's job was to work for the agreed hours regardless of the number of rooms (since time-based), maybe the cleaner's issue is with the app's pricing model rather than the customer.\n\nAnother angle: ethical responsibility. Even if the app's system is based on room count, the author intentionally provided false information to get a cheaper rate, which might not be fair to the cleaner who's now expected to do more work than anticipated. The cleaner might have priced their work based on the listed rooms, and the author's deception could lead to underpayment or overwork for the cleaner without additional compensation.\n\nHowever, the cleaner was paid for the full hours, and the author didn't ask for more hours or additional payment. The author's instruction was to prioritize downstairs, and the cleaner had the remaining time to do what they could. The cleaner's frustration is about the perceived deception in the listing, not necessarily the work done during the paid hours. \n\nIn terms of legal or contractual obligation, if the cleaner is an independent contractor hired via the app's system, the terms might be based on the listed rooms. The author's manipulation of the system to get a lower rate could be considered a breach of the app's terms, which might affect the cleaner's compensation. However, the app's terms are the contract between the user and the app, not directly the cleaner. The cleaner's contract is with the app, which might have set the hours based on the room count. \n\nSo, the author's main issue is with the app's system, not the cleaner. But by misleading the app, the author indirectly misled the cleaner. The cleaner might feel that the author is responsible for the discrepancy. However, the author did clarify on-site, so maybe the cleaner's anger is misplaced. The author is within their rights to prioritize certain areas during the paid hours, as long as they compensate the cleaner for the agreed time. \n\nBut morally, the author could be in the wrong for being deceptive to get a cheaper rate, especially if the cleaner ends up doing more work without additional pay. However, since the cleaner was paid for the full time and the author didn't ask for extra work, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer hinges on whether the deception to the app (by underreporting rooms) is considered unethical or if the cleaner's anger is unfounded since the author followed up with clear instructions.\n"
