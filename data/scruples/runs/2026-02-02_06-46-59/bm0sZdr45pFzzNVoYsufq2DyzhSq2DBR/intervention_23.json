They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where the service duration is determined by the number of rooms listed. They intentionally underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour booking instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then was upset about not being able to clean the upstairs because the user didn't list all the rooms.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user was wrong to misrepresent the house size. The app's system is based on the number of rooms to calculate the time, implying that the cleaner is expected to clean all listed rooms within that allocated time. By not listing all rooms, the user effectively set up a situation where the cleaner might not finish everything, but the user's intention was to only clean the downstairs. However, the cleaner's job is to clean all listed areas within the given time. The user didn't communicate the full scope upfront, leading to the cleaner's frustration when there were more rooms than anticipated. \n\nThe user might argue that they told the cleaner to focus on downstairs and go upstairs if time permits. But the cleaner's contract or service agreement might be based on the listed rooms, so the user's misrepresentation could be seen as deceptive. Even if the user's intention was to have only the downstairs done, not disclosing all rooms led to a misunderstanding. The cleaner might feel they were contracted to clean all listed areas, and the user's omission led to unfair expectations. Therefore, the user is at fault for not being transparent about the actual size of the house when making the booking. The correct answer is A.\n"
