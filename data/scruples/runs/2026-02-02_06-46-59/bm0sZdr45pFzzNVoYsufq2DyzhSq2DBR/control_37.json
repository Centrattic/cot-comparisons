They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour job instead of a longer one. The cleaner ended up finishing downstairs quickly and was upset when he realized there were more rooms upstairs than listed. The user told him not to worry about the upstairs, but the cleaner was angry.\n\nFirst, the user intentionally misrepresented the house size to reduce the cost. That's a problem because the app's pricing is based on the number of rooms. By not listing all the rooms, they essentially paid for a smaller job than what they received. The cleaner might have expected to clean all the listed rooms, but the user didn't include all of them, so he was overcharged? Wait, no\u2014wait, the user paid based on a smaller number of rooms, right? So the app assigned 4 hours because of the smaller number. But the user's house actually has more rooms. So the cleaner was hired for a job that took less time than expected because the user hid the full size. The user might have saved money but ended up with extra time, which the cleaner didn't know how to use.\n\nThe user told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, but the cleaner was upset because he thought he was supposed to clean all the listed rooms. However, the user didn't list all the rooms, so the cleaner wasn't informed about the upstairs. The cleaner's job was based on the user's false information, leading to a mismatch between expectations and reality. The cleaner's anger might stem from feeling misled, as he expected to clean the listed rooms but the user didn't list all of them. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user misrepresented the house size to get a lower price. They knew the app's pricing model and exploited it. The cleaner's contract was based on the user's false input, so the user is at fault here. The cleaner's job was to clean the listed rooms, but the user didn't list all of them, so the user is in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size. The user should have either listed the actual number of rooms and paid for the longer time or communicated clearly with the cleaner once they arrived. Since the user lied upfront, they are responsible for the misunderstanding. Answer A.\n"
