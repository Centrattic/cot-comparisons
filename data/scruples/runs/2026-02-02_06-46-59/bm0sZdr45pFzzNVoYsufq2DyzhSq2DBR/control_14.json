They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs areas, so they didn't list all the actual rooms and bathrooms they have in the house. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, becoming angry when the author didn't want him to clean all the upper areas. The author is now wondering if they were wrong for not listing the full size.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app's system is designed so that the number of rooms determines the hours and the scope of work, then the author might have misrepresented the house's size. By not listing all the rooms, the author could be seen as giving an incomplete or false picture, leading to a cleaner being under-quoted for the actual work. However, the author's intention was to have the cleaner focus on the downstairs only, and they made that clear upon arrival. The cleaner might have expected to clean all the listed rooms, but the author didn't list them all. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the app's system is based on the listed rooms to calculate the time, then the cleaner was hired for a certain amount of time based on that data. If the actual house has more rooms, but the cleaner finished the downstairs in less time, the author is still only paying for the time they scheduled. The cleaner might feel this is unfair because they might have expected that the listed rooms were all the ones that needed cleaning. However, the author didn't specify that the cleaner should only do the listed rooms; they just didn't list all of them. The app's terms might be a factor here. If the app's agreement states that the cleaner is responsible for all listed rooms, but the author didn't list them all, then the author might be at fault for not providing accurate information. \n\nOn the other hand, the author made it clear upon arrival that the priority was the downstairs and that the cleaner could do the upstairs as time permits. The cleaner might have been under the impression that the listed rooms were the only ones to be cleaned. By not listing the upper rooms, the author might have misled the cleaner about the actual scope, but if the app's system is designed to calculate time based on the listed rooms, then the author's input was incorrect. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation of the service. If the app's model is that the cleaner is expected to clean all the listed rooms within the assigned time, then the author's underreporting could lead to an underestimation of the time needed. The cleaner might have been expecting that the time allocated was sufficient for all listed rooms, but since the author didn't list the actual number, the cleaner may have felt they were shortchanged. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to have the cleaner focus on the downstairs and not the upstairs. The key point is whether the app's system requires the user to list all rooms that the cleaner should clean. If the app uses the number of rooms to calculate the time, then the author's misrepresentation would have resulted in a shorter appointment than what the cleaner expected. The cleaner might have been under the impression that the listed rooms were the ones to be cleaned, and since the author didn't list the upper rooms, the cleaner might be within their rights to be upset. \n\nBut the author did make their intention clear when the cleaner arrived, so maybe the cleaner was at fault for not clarifying or adhering to the instructions. The author paid for the time, and if the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly, the author isn't obligated to pay for more work than what was agreed upon. \n\nIn summary, the author might be at fault for not accurately listing the house's size, which could have led to the app assigning an insufficient time for the actual work. However, the author clearly communicated the priority areas upon arrival, which might mitigate some of the fault. The cleaner might have a right to be upset if the app's system is based on accurate room counts. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they communicated the actual task. It's a bit of a gray area, but the main issue is the misrepresentation of the house's size when using the app's system.\n"
