They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires you to input the number of rooms and bathrooms to determine how many hours the cleaner will work. The author didn't list the actual number of rooms and bathrooms because they wanted the cleaner to only focus on the downstairs. They thought that by adjusting the numbers, they could get a 4-hour service, which would be enough for the downstairs. \n\nThe cleaner arrived, did the downstairs quickly, and then when shown the upstairs, he got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author explained that the cleaner doesn't have to finish the upstairs, just do what he can in the remaining time. But the cleaner was still upset.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, when using a service like this, the app probably has a system where the number of rooms and bathrooms correlates to the time needed. If you underreport the number of rooms, the app gives you a lower estimate of time. But if there are actually more rooms, the cleaner might feel that the job isn't fair. The author might have misled the cleaner by not providing accurate information about the house's size. \n\nHowever, the author did communicate at the start that the priority was the downstairs and that the cleaner could do the upstairs only if there was time left. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed rooms within the given time, but if there are more rooms, that could be a problem. \n\nBut wait, the app's model is based on the information the user inputs. If the user inputs incorrect data, leading to a lower time estimate, the cleaner is still getting paid for the time they work. The author is paying them for the hours they hired, so even if the cleaner finishes the downstairs quickly, they still have to work for the full time. However, the cleaner's job might be to clean the listed rooms. If the author didn't list all the rooms, the cleaner might not be responsible for the unlisted ones. \n\nBut the cleaner is angry because the house is bigger than listed. The author's intention was to only clean the downstairs, but the cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms. The confusion here is whether the app's system is based on the number of rooms (so if you list more, you get more time). By underreporting, the author got a shorter time, but the actual number of rooms is higher. So the cleaner is working the same amount of time but for more rooms than expected. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the app calculated the time based on the number of rooms, so if there are more rooms, the time should be longer. But the author didn't provide the accurate info, leading to a mismatch. The cleaner is then in a position where he's working the same hours but for a larger house than the app's estimate. \n\nSo the author might be in the wrong because they provided false information to the app, which led to an incorrect time estimate. The cleaner was hired under the assumption that the listed rooms would be cleaned within the given time. The author's deception (intentionally underreporting rooms to get a cheaper rate) led to the cleaner being underpaid for the actual work required. Even if the author told the cleaner at the start, the initial listing was misleading. \n\nBut then again, the app's terms might specify that the user is responsible for accurate information. If the user didn't, they might be breaching the terms. Also, the cleaner is paid for the time, not the number of rooms. So the author is paying for 4 hours, and the cleaner works those 4 hours. The problem is that the cleaner feels he's being asked to clean more rooms than he was contracted for. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to only clean the downstairs, but by not listing the actual number of rooms, they might have misled the cleaner. The app's algorithm is likely designed to calculate the necessary time based on the number of rooms. So underreporting rooms leads to a shorter time, but the actual house is bigger. The cleaner might feel he's being asked to do more work in the same time. \n\nHowever, the author did clarify that the priority was the downstairs and that the cleaner could do the upstairs only if time permits. The cleaner's anger might stem from the fact that the house is bigger than listed, but the author's communication during the service might have addressed that. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is at fault for providing false information to the app, leading to a possible unfair situation. The cleaner was hired with the assumption that the listed rooms would be cleaned in the given time. By not listing all rooms, the author is essentially asking the cleaner to do more work in the same time frame, which might not be fair. However, the cleaner is still being paid for the time, not the number of rooms. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house's size to get a cheaper service, leading to a situation where the cleaner is expected to clean more than the app's estimate. The app's system is based on accurate data, and the author's manipulation of that data could be considered dishonest. Even if the author tried to clarify during the service, the initial misrepresentation is the key issue here.\n"
