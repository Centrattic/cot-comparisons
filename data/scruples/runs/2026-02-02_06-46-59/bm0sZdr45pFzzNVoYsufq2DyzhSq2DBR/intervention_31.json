They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by inputting the number of rooms. The user lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour job instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and went upstairs, but got upset because there were more rooms than listed. The user told the cleaner not to worry about finishing upstairs, but the cleaner was angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are the terms of the service. When using the app, the user provided false information about the house size, which directly affected the pricing and expected work duration. The app's system likely uses the number of rooms as an estimate for the time needed. By lying, the user might have paid less than what the actual job required. The cleaner probably expects to clean the listed number of rooms, and finishing early might have led to the user thinking the job was done, but the cleaner might feel underpaid if the user didn't use all the allocated time. However, the user did hire them for 4 hours, so even if the cleaner finished early, the user is supposed to pay for the full time. But the cleaner was upset about the discrepancy in the house size. \n\nIs the user wrong? If the app's terms state that the cleaner must clean all listed rooms, then the user's lie was deceptive. But if the app only estimates time based on rooms, the user might have misused the system. The user did inform the cleaner about focusing on the downstairs, but the cleaner still felt misled. The user might have breached the trust by providing incorrect info, leading to the cleaner's frustration. Alternatively, if the cleaner's contract is time-based, the user did pay for the time, and the cleaner could have chosen to leave after 4 hours regardless of the extra rooms. But the cleaner went upstairs, expecting to use the full time, then got upset when there were more rooms. The user's problem is that they didn't list the actual house size, leading to a mismatch in expectations. So, the user is in the wrong for providing false information, even if they tried to adjust the scope during the job. The answer is A.\n"
