They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to get a lower price. The app's system uses the number of rooms to determine the cleaning time. The user only wanted the downstairs cleaned but listed fewer rooms to get a 4-hour job. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when they saw the actual number of rooms, they got upset and angry.\n\nFirst, the user intentionally provided false information to get a shorter, cheaper service. They knew that by not listing all the rooms, the app would calculate a lower number of hours. However, the cleaner ended up with extra time and decided to clean the upstairs rooms, which the user didn't expect. When they realized the cleaner was working on the upstairs, they showed the areas, but the cleaner was upset because the actual number of rooms exceeded what was listed.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The user misrepresented the house size to get a cheaper rate. 2) The app's pricing model is based on room count, so the user's deception affected the agreed-upon service. 3) The cleaner might have expected to clean only the listed rooms and was upset when there were more than anticipated.\n\nLegally and ethically, when you hire a service, you need to be honest about the scope of work. By providing incorrect information, the user could be considered in the wrong because they set up expectations that were not met. The cleaner might have priced their service based on the listed rooms, and the user's deception led to a situation where the cleaner felt overworked or underpaid. The user's claim that the cleaner didn't have to finish everything is a bit weak since they invited the cleaner upstairs and then got upset when they worked on those areas. The cleaner had every right to feel misled, especially since the initial listing was inaccurate.\n\nBut wait, the user also said they told the cleaner that upstairs cleaning wasn't necessary. However, the cleaner might have assumed they were being paid for the listed rooms and that any extra work was optional. Still, the user's initial deception is problematic. The cleaner's frustration is understandable because they were given a false premise. The user's actions could be seen as exploiting a loophole in the app's system to get a cheaper service, which isn't fair to the cleaner.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's dishonesty about the house size to save money is the main issue here. Even though they tried to clarify the priorities, the initial misrepresentation is what led to the conflict. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
