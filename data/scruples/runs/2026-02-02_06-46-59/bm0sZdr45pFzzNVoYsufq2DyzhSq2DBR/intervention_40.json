They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires them to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author didn't input the actual numbers because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs areas. They lied about the size to get a 4-hour booking. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when they saw more rooms than listed, they got angry. The author explained that the upstairs wasn't necessary and the cleaner only needed to do as much as possible in the remaining time, but the cleaner was still upset.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is at fault here. Let's consider the key points. When using such apps, typically, the service agreement is based on the information provided. If the app asks for the number of rooms, it's likely to calculate the appropriate time needed for the job. By misrepresenting the number of rooms, the author might have misled the cleaner into thinking the job was smaller than it actually was. \n\nThe author's intention was to save money by not paying for the full time the cleaner would have needed for the entire house. However, the cleaner might have expected to clean all the listed rooms within the provided time. Even though the author emphasized focusing on the downstairs, the contract was based on a certain scope (as per the app's calculation), which was misrepresented. The cleaner might feel that their work was undervalued or that they were tricked into accepting a job that required more work than anticipated. \n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, if the app's terms require accurate information to determine service hours, the author violated that by providing false data. The cleaner's anger could stem from the fact that they were promised a certain scope for a set time, but the actual work was more than that, leading to unfinished tasks. The author then expects the cleaner to work on the extra without additional compensation, which might not be fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did clarify from the start that the priority was the downstairs and the cleaner had time left over. But the cleaner might have assumed that the listed rooms were all the ones they needed to clean within the given time. The misunderstanding here is significant. The author didn't accurately represent the job's scope, leading to the cleaner's frustration.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's misrepresentation of the house's size led to a mismatch in expectations. Even if the author intended to use the remaining time for upstairs, the contract wasn't clear about that. Therefore, the author is at fault for not providing accurate information, which is essential for such services. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
