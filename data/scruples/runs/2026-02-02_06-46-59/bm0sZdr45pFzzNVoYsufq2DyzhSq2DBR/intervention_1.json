They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user asked if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the service duration is determined by the number of rooms (bedrooms and bathrooms) listed. The author intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a shorter, cheaper service, intending to only have the cleaner clean the downstairs. However, the cleaner finished quickly and was given the remaining time to work on the upstairs, but upon being shown the additional rooms, the cleaner got angry and felt misled.\n\nFirst, the app's system is designed so that the number of rooms dictates the hours. By not providing accurate info, the author is technically violating the app's intended process. The cleaner might have agreed to the job based on the listed rooms, expecting a certain workload. The author's intention was to get a shorter service but then offer the cleaner extra work if time allows. However, the cleaner felt misled, which could be justified because the initial terms (based on the rooms listed) didn't account for the extra spaces. \n\nThe author argues that the cleaner only needed to work the paid hours, but the cleaner might feel that the contract was implicitly based on the listed rooms. If the app calculates hours based on rooms, then not listing all rooms could be a breach of the service agreement. The cleaner's anger stems from the discrepancy between what was agreed (based on room count) and the actual work required. \n\nWhile the author's intention was to save money and prioritize certain areas, the act of lying about the house size to manipulate the pricing and service duration is a key point. Even if the author tried to clarify the priorities upon the cleaner's arrival, the initial misrepresentation could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner might have relied on the listed rooms to plan their work and manage their time. \n\nHowever, the author did offer the cleaner the remaining time to work on the upstairs if they wanted, which might mitigate some responsibility. But the cleaner's primary grievance is about being misled about the scope of the job. The ethical question here is whether intentionally providing false information to get a cheaper price justifies the cleaner's anger. \n\nIn terms of strict contractual terms, if the app requires accurate room counts to determine the service duration, then the author is at fault for not providing accurate info. The cleaner's attitude might be unprofessional, but the root cause is the author's misrepresentation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
