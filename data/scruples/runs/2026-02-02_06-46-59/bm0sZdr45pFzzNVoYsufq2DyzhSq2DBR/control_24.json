They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about hiring a cleaner through an app, but lying about the size of the house to get a lower price. The cleaner got angry because there were more rooms than listed, even though the user told him he didn't have to finish everything.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The user used an app where you input the number of rooms and bathrooms, and the app calculates the hours. To get a 4-hour option, they underreported the rooms. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown more rooms, he got upset. The user explained that only the downstairs was important, and the cleaner could do as much as time allowed. But the cleaner was still angry, leading the user to question if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is at fault. Let me break it down.\n\n1. **Misrepresentation of House Size**: The user didn't list the actual number of rooms to get a cheaper rate. This is a key point. If the app's pricing model is based on the size of the house (bedrooms and bathrooms), then underreporting to get a lower price could be considered deceptive. The cleaner's payment is likely tied to the time allocated based on the house size. By lying, the user might have set up an unfair expectation.\n\n2. **Instructions Given to the Cleaner**: The user told the cleaner to focus on downstairs and only do as much upstairs as possible. However, the cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms within the quoted time. If the app's terms state that the cleaner is responsible for all listed rooms, the user might have breached that agreement by not providing accurate info.\n\n3. **Cleaner's Reaction**: The cleaner was angry because the actual house size didn't match what was listed. Even if the user instructed to prioritize downstairs, the cleaner's contract might be based on the listed size. The user's deception could have led to a mismatch between the cleaner's expectations and the job's reality, leading to frustration.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Was it ethical to misrepresent the house size? Intentionally providing false information to get a better deal could be seen as dishonest. The cleaner might feel that the user misled them, affecting their ability to manage their time and workload.\n\n5. **Legal or Contractual Obligations**: Depending on the app's terms, there might be rules about accurate house descriptions. If the user violated those terms, they could be in the wrong. Also, the cleaner might be paid per the listed hours, which could be based on the house size.\n\n6. **User's Intentions**: The user's main goal was to clean the downstairs, which they prioritized. They might not have intended to take advantage but still misrepresented the facts. However, the consequence was an unhappy cleaner and a potential breach of agreement.\n\nNow, considering all these points, the user did mislead the cleaner by not providing accurate information, which directly affected the cleaner's payment and expectations. Even if the user clarified their instructions, the initial deception is problematic. The cleaner's anger stems from the discrepancy between the listed and actual house size, which the user caused. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong.\n"
