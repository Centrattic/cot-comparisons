They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the number of bedrooms and bathrooms determines the time allocated. The author lied about the house size to get a lower price (4 hours instead of more) but then expected the cleaner to only clean the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and was angry when the author showed him more rooms to clean, even though the author had told him only to do what he could in the time.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the terms of the service. The app uses the number of rooms to calculate the time required. If the user provided false information about the number of rooms, that might be a problem. The cleaner probably expected to clean a house of the size listed, but the user actually has a larger house. The contract here is based on the information the user gave. By lying about the house size, the user might have violated the terms of the service. The app likely assumes that the number of rooms corresponds to the actual number, so the user is misrepresenting the house's size to get a cheaper rate. \n\nThe cleaner's job was to clean a house with a certain number of rooms as per the app's calculation. If the user's house has more rooms, the time allocated by the app (4 hours) might be insufficient for the actual size. The user told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and that the upstairs was optional, but the cleaner might feel that the initial agreement was based on a different premise. The cleaner could argue that the user misled them by not listing all the rooms, leading to an incomplete job. \n\nHowever, the user did clarify upon the cleaner's arrival that only the downstairs was necessary and that the cleaner could do the upstairs if time allowed. The cleaner might still be upset because they were under the impression that the listed rooms were the only ones to be cleaned. The user might have breached the implicit contract by not being honest about the house size. \n\nOn the other hand, the user could argue that they only needed 4 hours of cleaning for the downstairs and that the app's algorithm was based on their input. If the cleaner finished early, the user could choose not to extend the time, even if there are more rooms. The problem is whether the user's misrepresentation affected the cleaner's ability to do their job as agreed. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the user intentionally lied to get a lower price, which is deceptive. The cleaner trusted the information given and might have priced their time based on that. The user's action could be seen as unethical. However, legally, it might depend on the app's terms. If the app's terms require accurate information, then the user is in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user probably is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size, leading to a situation where the cleaner felt misled. The user's actions could be seen as dishonest, even if they tried to clarify later. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
