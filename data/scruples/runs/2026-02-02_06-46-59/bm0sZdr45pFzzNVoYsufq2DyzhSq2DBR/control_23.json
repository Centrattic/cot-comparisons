They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault here. So, the situation is: they hired a cleaner through an app where you input the number of rooms to get an hour estimate. The author lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour job, but the house actually has more rooms. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and went upstairs, but when shown the extra rooms, he got angry. The author explained they only needed the downstairs, and the cleaner was supposed to do what he could in the time. But the cleaner was upset about the discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the app's process. The app uses the number of rooms to calculate hours, so if you input fewer rooms, you get fewer hours. The author intentionally input fewer rooms to get a shorter, cheaper service. But the problem is the cleaner might expect to clean all the rooms listed. If the author lied about the number of rooms, then the app's calculation is based on incorrect data. The cleaner's contract (through the app) would be based on the stated number of rooms, so if the actual number is higher, the cleaner might feel they were underpaid or not given enough time.\n\nThe author's defense is that they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and didn't need the upstairs. But the app's terms likely assume that the rooms listed are the ones to be cleaned within the given time. If the author didn't list the upstairs rooms, the cleaner might not have agreed to clean them. So the problem is the discrepancy between what was listed and the actual house size. The cleaner might feel that the author tricked them by not listing all rooms, leading to a situation where the cleaner worked more than anticipated or felt undercompensated for the extra work.\n\nAlso, the author's explanation that the cleaner only needed to do as much as possible in the time might not align with the app's terms. The app probably expects the cleaner to handle all listed rooms within the given hours. If the author didn't list all rooms, the cleaner isn't obligated to do the unlisted ones. However, by showing the cleaner the extra rooms, the author might have implied that those were included, leading to confusion.\n\nThe cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that the job was misrepresented, leading to either underpayment (if the actual work required more time) or working on unlisted areas. The author's actions might be considered deceptive because they intentionally provided false information to get a cheaper service, which could be seen as exploiting the system. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for misleading the cleaner about the house size, leading to a breach of the implicit contract when using the app's service.\n"
