They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app. The app uses the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the number of hours. The author lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour estimate instead of a longer one because they only wanted the cleaner to do the downstairs. The cleaner did the downstairs quickly, then went upstairs and got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author told him he didn't have to finish everything upstairs, just what he had time for, but the cleaner was still upset.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. The app's system is based on the input of rooms to calculate hours. If the user inputs fewer rooms, the app gives a shorter time. The user didn't list all the rooms to save money/time. The cleaner, upon seeing more rooms, felt misled because the initial information was incorrect.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Legally or ethically? Well, when you sign up for a service, you're supposed to provide accurate information. By lying about the number of rooms, the author is technically misrepresenting the job's scope. The app's pricing model is based on that info, so the user is getting a cheaper rate than they should. The cleaner was hired based on the assumption that the job would take 4 hours as per the listed rooms. If there are more rooms, the cleaner might feel they were shortchanged because the job is longer. The author didn't inform the cleaner about the discrepancy, which could be a problem. The cleaner might have been expecting to clean only the listed rooms, so when they found more, they felt their time was being exploited.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did tell the cleaner that the priority was downstairs and that he could do upstairs if time allows. But the cleaner might have thought that the quoted time was based on the actual listed rooms, so when there were more, they felt it's unfair. The app's system is designed to take the rooms into account, so if the user lies, they might be violating the terms of service. The cleaner could argue that the user misrepresented the job, leading to an unfair situation where the cleaner is expected to work more without extra pay.\n\nBut maybe the app's terms don't strictly enforce that you can't lie. The user might have found a loophole. However, from an ethical standpoint, being honest is expected. The user tried to deceive the system to save costs. The cleaner, following the job as described, might have been under the impression that the time was enough for the listed rooms. If there were more rooms, the time wasn't sufficient, but that's the user's fault. The cleaner is within their rights to be upset if they feel the user misled them. The author might be at fault for not being honest and setting the right expectations with the cleaner. The cleaner could feel that their time was wasted or that they were overworked without compensation. The user should have either listed the correct number of rooms or communicated with the cleaner about the actual scope upfront. Since the user didn't, the cleaner has a valid reason to be angry. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they misrepresented the job and the cleaner was justified in feeling misled. Alternatively, if the app's system allows for such discretion, maybe not. But the user's actions were deceptive. I think the author is in the wrong.\n"
