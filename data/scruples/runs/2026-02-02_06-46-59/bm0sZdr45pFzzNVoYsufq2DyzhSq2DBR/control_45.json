They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying about the house size when hiring a cleaner. So, the situation is that they used an app where you input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the app calculates the hours. The author didn't input the actual numbers because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but there were more rooms than listed, which made the cleaner angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, they probably have a system where the hours are based on the size of the house as listed. If the author provided incorrect information, that's a problem. The app's algorithm might assume that the listed rooms are all that need cleaning. So, by lying about the house size, the author might be taking advantage of the system to get a lower price. \n\nThen, the cleaner showed up and the author told them to focus on the downstairs, but there was extra time. The cleaner then went upstairs and found more rooms than listed. The cleaner is upset because maybe the contract (even if informal) was based on the listed rooms. The author is saying that the cleaner was supposed to only clean as much as possible within the time, but the cleaner might feel they were entitled to a full clean of all listed rooms, and since the author didn't list all rooms, the cleaner is overworked for the same pay.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they told the cleaner to do as much as possible, but the cleaner might have expected to finish the listed rooms first. The misunderstanding could be on both sides. The author didn't list accurately, leading the cleaner to believe the job would be a certain size, but then there were more rooms than expected. The cleaner might feel that the author misled them, even if the app's system was the initial point of misrepresentation.\n\nBut wait, the author also tried to clarify when the cleaner arrived. Maybe the cleaner thought they were being asked to clean more than they were paid for. The author didn't explain the discrepancy in the listing. So, even if the cleaner was told to focus on the downstairs, the fact that the house is larger than listed might make the cleaner feel they're being asked to do extra work without additional pay. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size to get a cheaper quote, leading to the cleaner being underpaid for the actual work done. Even if the author tried to clarify on the day, the initial deception is the problem. The cleaner might feel that the house was bigger than represented, so the hours they were paid for were insufficient for the actual work. Therefore, the author is at fault here.\n"
