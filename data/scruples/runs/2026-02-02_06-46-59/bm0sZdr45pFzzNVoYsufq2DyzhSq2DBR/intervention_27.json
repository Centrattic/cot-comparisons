They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a lower price. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got upset about having to clean the upstairs, which wasn't listed.\n\nFirst, the app's system probably calculates hours based on the number of rooms. By underreporting, the user got a shorter time than what the cleaner expected for the actual house size. The cleaner might have been hired for a job that, based on the listed info, should have taken 4 hours, but the actual house is bigger. The cleaner's job is to clean according to the listed size, so when they see more rooms, they feel they're being asked to work more without extra pay.\n\nThe user tried to explain that the upstairs wasn't necessary, but the cleaner was already under the impression that the job was a certain size. The user might have misled the cleaner by not providing accurate info, leading to a breakdown in trust. Even if the user said the cleaner could stop after 4 hours, the cleaner might feel their time isn't valued if they have to do extra work they weren't paid for.\n\nAlso, the user's defense is that they only wanted the cleaner for the downstairs, but the app's pricing is tied to the house's size. Not giving accurate info could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner's anger is about being misled, not just about the extra work. So, the user is in the wrong for providing false information, leading to a service that the cleaner wasn't properly compensated for. The answer should be A.\n"
