They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house. They didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs, so they underreported the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour job instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when he saw there were more rooms than listed, he got angry. The user says they told him the upstairs wasn't necessary and he could just do as much as he had time for. The cleaner still left upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The user intentionally provided false information to the app to get a shorter service time. By lying about the house size, they manipulated the system to get a lower cost (hours) than the actual work required. Even though they told the cleaner the upstairs wasn't important, the initial deception might be the main issue here. The cleaner followed the listed hours based on the false info, but the actual work took less time, leading to leftover time. The user might feel they got value for the money, but the cleaner could feel misled because the job scope wasn't as expected. If the app uses the room count to determine hours, then the user's lie created an imbalance. The cleaner might have expected that the listed rooms would take the full time, but the user's underreporting led to the cleaner having extra time, which they might not be happy about. Also, the cleaner's anger might stem from being used as a \"de facto\" cleaner for more than what was paid for, even if the user told him not to finish everything. The user's deception, even if well-intentioned, could be seen as unethical because it's misleading the service provider. The fact that the cleaner is upset about the discrepancy in the listed versus actual rooms suggests that the user's actions were wrong. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for providing false information to get a cheaper service, even if they tried to clarify the priorities on the day.\n"
