They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app. The author lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour service instead of more. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got upset about the upstairs not being as described.\n\nFirst, the app's system is based on the number of rooms. The user didn't input all the rooms to keep the time lower. They told the cleaner to focus on downstairs and do what he can upstairs. The cleaner got angry because there were more rooms than listed.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the app's pricing and time estimation is based on the rooms listed. By not being truthful, the user might have misled the app's algorithm. The cleaner probably expected to clean the number of rooms listed for the 4-hour time. When there were more rooms, he might feel that the user was deceptive, leading to a longer job than expected.\n\nThe user tried to explain that the upstairs wasn't as important, but the cleaner might feel that he was promised a certain amount of work based on the listed rooms. The user didn't account for the fact that the app's calculation is tied to the room count, which affects the cleaner's expectations. Even though the user said he could do upstairs if time allowed, the cleaner might have felt that the user manipulated the system to get a lower price but then expected him to do more work.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might argue that the cleaner was still paid for 4 hours and could choose to stop after that. But the cleaner might feel that the initial terms were misrepresented. The user's siblings and the parent's strictness about cleanliness might justify the need for a cleaner, but the method of deception is questionable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, lying to get a cheaper service when the provider relies on accurate information to set expectations could be seen as wrong. The user didn't consider that the cleaner might rely on the listed rooms to manage his work within the given time. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that he was misled, even if the user later clarified. The app's system is designed to estimate time based on room count, so bypassing that could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong for providing false information to the app, which affects the cleaner's expectations and workload. The cleaner's reaction is a consequence of that deception. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
