They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a shorter cleaning time. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours. The cleaner ended up finishing downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The user says they only wanted downstairs cleaned and the cleaner could do upstairs if there was time. The cleaner was upset and the user is wondering if they're wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the user misrepresent the house size to get a lower price (fewer hours), and did that misrepresentation lead to a problem? The app's system is based on the number of rooms to calculate the hours. If the user didn't list all the rooms accurately, they might have been trying to pay less by making the house seem smaller. The cleaner might have expected to clean a certain number of rooms based on the initial information. When they found out there were more, they felt it was unfair, even though the user had mentioned that upstairs wasn't necessary. \n\nNow, considering the user's age (17-22), they might not be experienced with such services and may not know the standard practices. However, the app's terms probably require accurate information. The user manipulated the app's system to get a shorter cleaning time, which could be considered deceptive. The cleaner followed the initial instructions but then had more work than expected, leading to frustration. \n\nThe user might argue that they made it clear the priority was downstairs and the cleaner could do whatever they wanted with the remaining time. But the cleaner might have expected to clean all the listed rooms within the booked hours. By not listing all the rooms, the user set up a situation where the hours were insufficient, leading to the cleaner's anger. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user provided incorrect information, which led to an incomplete job and possible overwork for the cleaner. Even if the user thought they were saving money, the cleaner's job was to clean what was listed. The user might be in the wrong for not being honest about the house's size, leading to a misunderstanding. Alternatively, the cleaner might have a right to be upset if they felt misled. \n\nThe user is now considering a complaint because of the cleaner's attitude. But if the cleaner felt wronged, the user's actions could be seen as unethical. The app's policy likely requires accurate information, so the user's manipulation of that to get a lower price is the root issue. Therefore, the answer might be that the user is in the wrong.\n"
