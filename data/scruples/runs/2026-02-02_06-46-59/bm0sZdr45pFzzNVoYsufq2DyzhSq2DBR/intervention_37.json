They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. I need to figure out the answer based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author didn't input the actual numbers because they only wanted the cleaner to clean the downstairs. The app gave a 4-hour estimate, which the cleaner finished in 90 minutes. Then, when the cleaner went upstairs, he got angry because the house was bigger than listed.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author lied about the size of the house. The app's system is based on the user providing accurate info to determine the time. If the author gave incorrect details, that could be a problem. Even though the author explained the focus on the downstairs, the cleaner might have expected the listed rooms to be the only ones they'd clean. \n\nThe cleaner might have been hired under the assumption that the time provided was sufficient for the listed rooms. If the house actually has more rooms than listed, the cleaner might feel they were misled about the scope of work. The author didn't mention the extra rooms upfront, even though they could have adjusted the app's inputs to reflect the full size. \n\nAlso, the author's siblings are using the parents' house, so maybe the app expects the user to list the actual number of rooms regardless of who is using it. The cleaner was probably expecting to clean the listed rooms for the given time, and finishing early might have made them think they weren't paid enough for the actual work done. \n\nThe author might have a point in wanting to save money by not listing all rooms, but the cleaner's job is to clean the listed areas. The author didn't clarify that the extra rooms weren't part of the initial agreement beyond a certain time. The cleaner's anger could stem from feeling they were cheated out of their expected work for the rate they were paid. \n\nIn terms of the app's rules, if the system requires accurate input for the time estimate, then the author's false input would mean the cleaner wasn't properly compensated. The author is responsible for providing accurate information. Even if the cleaner had time to do extra, the initial part of the job (downstairs) was done in less time, but the cleaner might have expected to cover all listed rooms. The author didn't list the full rooms, leading to a discrepancy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for providing inaccurate information to get a lower estimate, which led to the cleaner being confused and possibly underpaid for the actual work. The answer should be A.\n"
