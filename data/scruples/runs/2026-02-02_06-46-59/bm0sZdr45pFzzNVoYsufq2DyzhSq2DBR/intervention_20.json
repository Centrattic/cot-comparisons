They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author hired a cleaner through an app, and the app's system is based on listing the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The author didn't list all the rooms they have because they only wanted the cleaner to focus on the downstairs. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry when he realized there were more rooms than listed. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the app's process requires accurate listing of rooms to set the cleaning time. The author intentionally underreported to get a shorter cleaning period. The cleaner, under the impression that the job was for a smaller space, finished early and then had to deal with the upstairs, which wasn't part of the original agreement based on the app's calculation.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they wanted to save money by not listing all rooms and thought the cleaner would only do the downstairs. But the cleaner's job scope was determined by the app's algorithm, which relies on the user's input. By providing false information, the author set an expectation that the cleaner probably expected to meet. The cleaner might have planned their time based on the listed rooms, expecting to work the full hours. When they finished early and found more rooms, they felt their time was being manipulated, leading to frustration.\n\nLegally and ethically, when you use a service that requires accurate information, providing incorrect data to manipulate the service's outcome is generally considered dishonest. The cleaner's contract with the app (and thus with the user) is based on the information provided. The author's deception could be seen as a breach of the implicit contract. Even though the author explained the focus areas upon the cleaner's arrival, the initial listing was misleading, which the cleaner might not have agreed to if they knew the full extent.\n\nThe cleaner's reaction is understandable because their job is to clean the listed spaces. If the user doesn't list all spaces, the cleaner might not be compensated for the full work they're expected to do. The author's intent was to minimize costs by not including all rooms, which is a form of misrepresentation. The cleaner's anger stems from feeling that their work was undervalued or that they were tricked into a shorter job with the possibility of extra work unpaid.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is at fault for providing false information to an app that uses that data to determine service parameters. The cleaner's job scope was based on that data, and the author altered it to their advantage. The cleaner's contract (via the app) doesn't allow for the author to selectively choose parts of the house without accurately reporting its size. Therefore, the author's actions were deceptive and unethical, making them at fault.\n"
