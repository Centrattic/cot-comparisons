They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app. The app requires inputting the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours. The user didn't list all the actual rooms because they didn't want the cleaner to clean the upstairs, only the downstairs. The cleaner finished quickly and then went upstairs, but when shown the extra rooms, he got angry because they weren't listed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the user was wrong for not listing all the rooms. The app's process is based on the number of rooms to calculate the time. If the user provided incomplete information, that's a problem. The cleaner's job might be based on the assumption that the listed rooms are the only ones to be cleaned. By not providing accurate info, the user might have misled the cleaner. \n\nBut the user also said they told the cleaner that only the downstairs was important and he could do the upstairs if he had time. However, the cleaner might have expected to clean only the listed rooms. The contract is with the app, and the user didn't follow the app's terms by underreporting the rooms. So the user might have breached the agreement, leading to the cleaner's frustration. \n\nThe cleaner's reaction is partly his own issue, but the user is responsible for accurate information. Even if they clarified on-site, the initial misrepresentation is the key point. So the user is in the wrong for providing false information to get a lower price, even though they tried to adjust the scope later.\n"
