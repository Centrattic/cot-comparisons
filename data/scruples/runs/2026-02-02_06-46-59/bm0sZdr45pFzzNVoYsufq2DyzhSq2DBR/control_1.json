They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer one. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but there were more rooms than listed. The cleaner got angry because the actual number of rooms was higher, and the author told him he didn't have to finish everything upstairs. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app probably works by estimating time based on the number of rooms. If the user intentionally provided false information to get a lower price, that's a problem. The cleaner was hired for a specific job based on the information given. The user didn't mention the full size, which might have affected the cleaner's expectations. \n\nThe user's intention was to only have the downstairs cleaned, and they told the cleaner that. However, the cleaner ended up working more than expected, and when faced with more rooms than listed, he got upset. The user might have misled the app's system by not providing accurate info. Even though they told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the initial contract was based on false premises. \n\nIs it the user's responsibility to be honest with the app? If the app's terms require accurate information, then lying would be a breach. The cleaner was paid for a specific job, and the user altered the terms without the app's knowledge. The cleaner might feel that the user is taking advantage by not paying for the full service they should have. \n\nAlso, the user's argument is that they only needed the downstairs, and the cleaner had time left. But the cleaner's job might be based on the contract, not just the user's instructions. If the contract was based on false data, it's unclear if the service was properly compensated. The user could be in the wrong for not being honest, leading to a mispriced service and a conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the user tried to communicate their needs to the cleaner on arrival. But the cleaner's anger might stem from the initial deception rather than the user's in-the-moment communication. The real issue is the initial misinformation to the app. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the user is in the wrong) because they provided false information to the app, leading to an incorrect service agreement. Even if they tried to clarify later, the root issue is the initial lie."
