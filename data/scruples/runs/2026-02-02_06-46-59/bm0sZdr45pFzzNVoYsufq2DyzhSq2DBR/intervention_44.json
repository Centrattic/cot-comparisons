They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and they misrepresented the size of their house by not listing all the bedrooms and bathrooms. They did this to get a 4-hour cleaning job instead of a longer one. The cleaner was upset because he expected to clean based on the listed rooms but ended up with extra upstairs areas.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user's intention was to only clean the downstairs, but by lying about the house size, they got a cleaner who expected to clean based on the listed rooms. The app probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the time required. If the user didn't mention all the rooms, the cleaner might have expected a smaller house. Now, the cleaner is upset because there are more rooms than listed, even though the user told him to focus on the downstairs and only do what he can upstairs.\n\nThe user's defense is that they only needed the downstairs cleaned and the cleaner was instructed to use the remaining time for upstairs if possible. The cleaner, however, felt misled because the initial listing didn't match the actual house size. \n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, when you use an app to hire someone, the terms are usually based on the information provided. If the user provided false information, that's a problem. The cleaner's time and effort are based on the assumption that the listed rooms are accurate. Even if the user told the cleaner to focus on downstairs, the cleaner might have been prepared to clean a certain number of rooms, and the user's misrepresentation led to an unexpected situation. \n\nThe cleaner's anger is likely because he was promised a certain job scope based on the listed rooms. The user altered the app's assessment by not providing full details, leading to a mismatch in expectations. The user's responsibility here is to give accurate information when booking services. Even if their intention was to minimize costs, the cleaner's work is based on that information. \n\nTherefore, the user is in the wrong for providing false information, which led to the cleaner's frustration. The fact that the user told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs doesn't negate the initial misrepresentation. The cleaner's time and effort calculation would be based on the app's estimate, which was manipulated by the user. The user should have been honest about the house size to set the right expectations.\n"
