They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the app calculates the hours based on the number of rooms listed. The author lied about the number of rooms to get a 4-hour cleaning job, intending for the cleaner to only clean the downstairs areas. However, the cleaner finished quickly and then was upset when the author showed him the upstairs rooms, which weren't listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. If the app's process is designed to calculate the time based on the number of rooms provided, then misrepresenting that information could be an issue. The cleaner might have expected to clean the listed rooms within the provided time, but the author intentionally underreported to limit the cleaner's work to the downstairs. However, the cleaner might have assumed that the listed rooms were all the ones in the house, so when the author showed additional rooms, it felt like a deception.\n\nThe author's intention was to only pay for the downstairs cleaning, but the cleaner's contract might have been based on the rooms listed. If the app's service agreement states that the cleaner is paid for the listed rooms, then the author might have violated the terms by not listing all rooms. Additionally, the cleaner might feel that they were paid to clean a certain number of rooms, and the author is now asking them to do more without additional compensation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did explain when the cleaner arrived that the focus should be on the downstairs and that the upstairs was optional. The cleaner finishing early and then being upset about the additional rooms might be about unmet expectations rather than the author's initial misrepresentation. However, the cleaner's anger could stem from feeling that the author tricked them by not listing all rooms, leading to a situation where the cleaner feels underpaid or overworked.\n\nAnother angle is the app's business model. If the app's pricing is based on room count, the author's manipulation could be seen as gaming the system, which is ethically questionable. The cleaner's time is paid for based on the app's calculation, which assumes a certain amount of work. By not listing all rooms, the author might have created a mismatch between the cleaner's compensation and the actual work required.\n\nHowever, the author's explanation to the cleaner upon arrival might mitigate some responsibility. The cleaner might have agreed to focus on the downstairs, but the fact that there were more rooms than listed could still lead to confusion. The author's initial misrepresentation could have set up a situation where the cleaner felt misled, even if the author clarified their intentions later.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: the app's terms of service, the expectation based on room count, and the communication with the cleaner. If the app's terms are clear that the cleaner is expected to clean all listed rooms, then not listing them properly would be the author's fault. If the app's terms are that the cleaner is to clean all rooms in the house based on the provided count, then the author's misrepresentation is unethical. The cleaner's reaction indicates that they felt deceived, which the author might be responsible for.\n"
