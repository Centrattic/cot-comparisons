They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app, and the author lied about the number of rooms in the house to get a lower price. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and was expected to move up, but the author didn't want the upstairs cleaned. The cleaner got angry because the actual number of rooms was higher than what was listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When you use an app like that, there's usually an agreement based on the information you provide. If the app calculates the hours based on the number of rooms, then inputting false data could mean the author didn't pay for the actual work the cleaner could do. The cleaner might have expected to clean all listed rooms within the agreed hours, but the author tricked the system to get a shorter time. So, the cleaner is underpaid for the potential work they could do if the house was as large as it actually is. \n\nThen, the author told the cleaner not to finish the upstairs, even though the cleaner had time left. That might be a breach of the worker's expectations. The cleaner probably thought that the hours included all the rooms listed, so when they found out there were more rooms, they felt misled. The author's attitude of saying \"do as much as you can\" might not align with the cleaner's understanding of the job, which was based on the provided room count.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned the parent's strictness about cleanliness, but that's their own situation. The cleaner's job was based on the information given. The author's deception about the house size might be the key issue here. The app's system is designed to match hours to the house size, so altering that could be considered unethical or even a violation of the service terms.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author paid for the hours and the cleaner had time left. The author was clear about the priority areas. However, the cleaner's expectation might be that the listed rooms are all that need cleaning. If the author misrepresented the house size to get a lower price, that's a problem. The cleaner was probably compensated based on the smaller house size, which might not cover the actual work potential. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size to get a cheaper rate, leading to a situation where the cleaner was underpaid for the potential work and felt misled about the job scope. The answer should be A.\n"
