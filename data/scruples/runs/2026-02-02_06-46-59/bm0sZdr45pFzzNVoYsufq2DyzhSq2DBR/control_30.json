They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves hiring a cleaner through an app. The author lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour service instead of the longer time the actual size would have warranted. The cleaner got angry when he found out there were more rooms upstairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app's system is based on the number of rooms you list to determine the hours. By underreporting, the author manipulated the system to get a cheaper rate. The cleaner was hired for a specific amount of work based on the listed rooms, but the actual house has more. The cleaner might feel that he's being asked to do more than what was agreed upon. Even though the author told him he didn't have to finish the upstairs, the cleaner could argue that the contract was based on a certain scope of work, and the author misrepresented that.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they paid for a set number of hours and that the cleaner has the right to use that time as he sees fit. The author emphasized focusing on the downstairs, which was the priority. The cleaner could have chosen to only clean the downstairs and leave early, but instead, he finished it quickly and then was upset about the extra rooms.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author misrepresented the scope of the job. If the app's pricing is tied to the number of rooms, then the author is responsible for the accurate information. The cleaner's job was to clean the listed rooms, not the entire house. The author's deception could be seen as unethical or even a breach of the service agreement. However, the cleaner might not have been aware of the app's calculation until he saw the extra rooms. There's also the cleaner's reaction to consider; he was angry and seemed to feel wronged, which suggests he felt the author deceived him.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, when you enter a contract (even a service one with an app), you're expected to provide accurate information. The author's underreporting could be considered misleading. The cleaner's pay was based on the assumption that the listed rooms were all that would be cleaned. Even if the author said not to finish the upstairs, the cleaner might feel that the author's initial misrepresentation is the issue.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for providing false information about the house size to get a lower rate, leading to the cleaner being underpaid for the actual work he did. The author's actions could be seen as deceptive, which is why the cleaner was upset.\n"
