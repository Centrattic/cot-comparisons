They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the pricing is based on the number of rooms listed. The author intentionally underreported the number of rooms to get a cheaper 4-hour service, intending the cleaner to only clean the downstairs. However, the cleaner finished quickly and then was upset about having to clean more upstairs areas than initially listed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were deceptive. The app's system is designed to estimate the time needed based on the number of rooms. By providing false information, the author manipulated the pricing. The cleaner was hired under the impression that they were cleaning a smaller space, but there were actually more rooms. The key point is whether the agreement was based on the accurate information provided. The author didn't disclose all the details upfront, leading to a misunderstanding. Even though the author explained their intention upon the cleaner's arrival, the initial listing was misleading. The cleaner might have agreed to the terms based on the listed rooms, so not cleaning all rooms as per the listing could be a breach of contract. However, the app's terms might not explicitly state that the cleaner must clean all listed rooms, just that the time is estimated based on the input. But the author didn't mention the possibility of not using all the time. The cleaner's anger suggests they felt misled because the job required more work than anticipated. The author might be in the wrong for misrepresenting the job's scope, leading to the cleaner's frustration. Alternatively, the author might argue that they clarified their needs upon arrival. But the initial false information sets the expectation. So, considering all angles, the author's intentional deception could make them responsible here. Answer A.\n"
