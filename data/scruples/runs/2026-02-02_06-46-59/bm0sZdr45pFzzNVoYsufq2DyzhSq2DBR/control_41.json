They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app. The writer lied about the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to get a specific number of hours, then the cleaner got angry because there were more rooms upstairs.\n\nFirst, when hiring a service like this, especially through an app, there are usually terms and conditions. The app probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the time needed. If the user input false information, they might be violating those terms. The cleaner could argue that they were hired based on the info provided, and not the actual size of the house. The writer said they didn't want the cleaner to clean upstairs, but the cleaner might feel that the job was misrepresented.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of the contract. If the app's terms state that the listed details are accurate, the writer's misinformation could be a breach. Also, the cleaner might have expected to clean the listed number of rooms based on the hours given. Even if the writer said they didn't need the cleaner to do the upstairs, the cleaner might have expected that the hours were based on the original listing.\n\nBut the writer did mention that the cleaner could do the upstairs if they had time. However, the cleaner might have felt misled because the initial information was incomplete. The key here is whether the app's service agreement requires accurate listing of the house's size. If the writer intentionally provided false info to get a lower cost, that's a problem. The cleaner's job is to clean the listed spaces, so if there are more rooms than listed, the writer might be overusing the cleaner's time beyond the agreed hours.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer might argue that they were only asking the cleaner to do the downstairs, and the time wasn't fully utilized. But the app's pricing model is based on the number of rooms, so the writer's manipulation of that could be considered deceptive. The cleaner might feel that they were hired for a certain scope of work, and the writer's actions exceeded that.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the writer likely misrepresented the job size, leading to a breach of the service agreement. Therefore, the answer would be A, the writer is in the wrong.\n"
