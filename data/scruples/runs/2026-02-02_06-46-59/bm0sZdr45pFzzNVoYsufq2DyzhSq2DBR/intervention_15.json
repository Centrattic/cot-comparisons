They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and they lied about the size of the house to get a cheaper or shorter service. The app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours, so the author underreported the bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour cleaner instead of a longer one. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then when shown the upstairs, he got angry because there were more rooms than listed. The author told him he didn't have to finish everything, just do what he can in the time.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the terms of the service. If the app's terms state that the quoted price and hours are based on the accurate number of rooms, then the author misrepresented the house size, which could be a breach of the agreement. But if the app's terms are more about the time and the client can specify areas to focus on, maybe the issue is the app's structure. However, the cleaner was given a specific job based on the input data. The author might have misled the cleaner by not being honest about the house size, even if they thought the cleaner would just do the downstairs. The cleaner might feel that the job was underpriced because more rooms were involved than listed, leading to a sense of being cheated. On the other hand, the author did explain the priority of the downstairs and allowed the cleaner to do other areas if time permitted. But the cleaner's anger suggests he felt the job scope was misrepresented. So, the author could be in the wrong for providing false information to the app, which affects the cleaner's compensation. Alternatively, if the app's system is based on the number of rooms, the author's deception might have led to an unfair situation for the cleaner. Therefore, A is the answer.\n"
