They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user hired a cleaner through an app, and when signing up, they misrepresented the size of the house by not listing all the bedrooms and bathrooms to get a 4-hour cleaning time instead of a longer one. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then got upset when the user showed him the upper floor, which wasn't listed. The user claims they told the cleaner to focus on the downstairs and do what he can upstairs, but the cleaner was angry.\n\nFirst, the user lied about the house size. The app's algorithm determines the hours based on the number of rooms. By not providing accurate information, the user might have misled the cleaner into thinking they were contracted to clean a smaller space. The cleaner probably expected to clean all the listed rooms within the agreed time. When they finished early and saw more rooms, they felt cheated or overworked. \n\nEven though the user said they only needed the downstairs, the cleaner might have had an understanding based on the initial listing. The user didn't clarify the exact scope of work beyond the app's initial assessment. The cleaner's job might be to clean all the rooms listed, so if the user didn't list them, the cleaner might not be responsible for the extra. However, the user's deception in listing the house size could be the issue here. \n\nThe cleaner's frustration is valid because they were promised a certain amount of work for a set time. The user's intention to only clean part of the house wasn't communicated clearly. While the user tried to explain it at the start, the cleaner might have already expected to clean all listed areas. The user's lie about the house size is the root problem, leading to the misunderstanding. So, the user is in the wrong for misleading the cleaner through the app's listing process.\n"
