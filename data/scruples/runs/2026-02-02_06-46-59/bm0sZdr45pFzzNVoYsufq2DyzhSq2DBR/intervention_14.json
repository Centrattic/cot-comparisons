They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that they hired a cleaner through an app, and intentionally lied about the size of the house to get a lower cost. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then was upset about having to clean the upstairs even though the user told them not to worry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The app uses the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to determine the hours and cost. The user wanted the cleaner to focus only on the downstairs, so they underreported the number of rooms. The cleaner was angry because the actual house was bigger than listed. The user tried to explain that the upstairs wasn't necessary, but the cleaner was still upset. The user is considering a complaint because of the attitude.\n\nNow, thinking about this, the user intentionally provided false information to the service. The app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the house's size. By lying, the user didn't pay for the full service. The contract here is between the user and the service, and the user misrepresented the facts. The cleaner was probably assigned based on that information, expecting a certain workload. If they finished downstairs quickly, maybe the user is being fair, but the initial misrepresentation is a problem. The user might be violating the terms of service by lying about the house size. The cleaner could feel misled because they were sent to a place that required more work than anticipated. Even if the user didn't want the cleaner to do the upstairs, the fact that they lied about the house's size is dishonest. The user's responsibility is to be truthful when using a service, especially one that's app-based where the system relies on accurate data. The cleaner's attitude is also an issue, but the user's actions might have contributed to the misunderstanding. So, the user is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size, leading to an unfair expectation. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
