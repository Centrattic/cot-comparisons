They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about hiring a cleaner through an app.\n\nThe key points here are that the author lied about the size of the house to get a lower price. They input fewer bedrooms and bathrooms than actually present so the app assigned fewer hours. The cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but when confronted with the actual number of rooms, he got angry. The author argues that the cleaner was only hired for a certain time and didn't have to finish all the upstairs areas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author intentionally provided false information to get a cheaper rate. The terms of the service via the app likely depend on accurate information. By misleading the app, the author might have entered into a contract based on false premises. The cleaner's time and payment are tied to the hours allocated, which were based on the incorrect input. The cleaner might feel that the job wasn't as described and that they were misled about the scope of work for the hours paid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did inform the cleaner that the downstairs was the priority and that they could do the upstairs if time permitted. The author might argue that the cleaner should have been willing to use the remaining time as they saw fit. However, the cleaner's reaction suggests that the terms were based on the listed rooms, and the author's omission of the actual number of rooms could be seen as deceptive.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the app's pricing is based on the number of rooms, then the author didn't pay for the extra rooms. If the cleaner's agreement was to clean the listed rooms for the given time, then the author's action might have violated the implicit contract. The cleaner could feel that they were entitled to not clean beyond what was listed, but the author's deception might have led to unexpected work.\n\nLegally, this could depend on the app's terms of service. If the app requires accurate information and the author provided false data, the author might be at fault. However, the cleaner's agreement might be with the app and the user's input, so the cleaner's responsibility is to the listed rooms. The author's misleading input could be the root of the problem.\n\nEthically, the author's intent to save money by lying about the house size is questionable. The cleaner might feel that they were wronged because the job wasn't as described. Even though the author tried to clarify upon arrival, the initial deception is a problem. The cleaner's anger is a reaction to being misled about the job's scope.\n\nIn conclusion, the author likely is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size to get a lower price, which led to a misunderstanding about the job's scope. The cleaner's frustration is justified given the deceptive information provided.\n"
