They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is they hired a cleaner through an app, but they lied about the size of their house to get a 4-hour service instead of a longer one. The cleaner ended up finishing the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, but got angry when they found out there were more rooms than listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. The app probably uses the number of rooms to estimate the time required. If the user input fewer rooms to get a cheaper or shorter service, that's a problem. The cleaner was paid for a specific job based on the information given. Even though the user said the cleaner didn't have to finish the upstairs, the cleaner might feel that the entire job was misrepresented. The user didn't inform the cleaner upfront about the actual size, leading to the cleaner feeling misled. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the app's system is based on inputting room numbers to get the right hours. By providing false info, they got a shorter service than what the actual house would require. The cleaner was there for 4 hours, which was based on the false input. The user might have expected the cleaner to only do the downstairs, but the app's pricing model likely factors in the entire house's size. \n\nThe cleaner's reaction is understandable because they were led to believe the house was smaller, so the time allocated was based on that. If the user had been honest, maybe the app would have charged for more hours, but the user chose to deceive to save money. The user's argument that the cleaner didn't have to finish the upstairs is valid, but the initial misrepresentation is the key issue. \n\nSo, the user misrepresented the house size to get cheaper service, leading to a misunderstanding. That's deceptive, so the user is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
