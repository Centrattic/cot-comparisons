They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about hiring a cleaner through an app where the number of hours is determined by the number of rooms listed. The author lied about the size of the house to get a cheaper rate, but then the cleaner ended up with extra time and got angry when the author expected him to clean more.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the terms of the service. The app uses the number of rooms to calculate the hours. If the author inputted fewer rooms than there actually are, the app gave a lower hourly rate. The cleaner, based on the information provided, probably estimated the work based on the listed rooms. But since the house is bigger, the cleaner finished the downstairs quickly and then was expected to do the upstairs, which wasn't listed. The cleaner is upset because the author misrepresented the house's size, leading to a situation where the cleaner feels underpaid for the actual work required.\n\nThe author argues that the cleaner was supposed to do the downstairs and then only do as much as possible upstairs. However, by providing incorrect information, the author may have misled the cleaner about the scope of the job. If the app's terms state that the number of rooms must be accurate, then the author violated that, making the contract invalid. The cleaner might feel entitled to more pay or to not do the extra work since the initial job description was different.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might think that since they paid for the time and the cleaner had the time left, they could request more work. But the cleaner's pay is likely based on the agreed hours for the listed rooms. The extra work wasn't part of the original agreement. The cleaner's anger is justified because the author didn't honor the terms by which the hours were calculated. The author's intention was to save money by not listing all rooms, which is a form of deception.\n\nSo, in terms of ethics and the agreement, the author is in the wrong because they provided false information to manipulate the pricing. The cleaner's entitlement to the hours is based on the initial data, and the author's actions led to a breach of trust and potentially an unfair work arrangement. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
