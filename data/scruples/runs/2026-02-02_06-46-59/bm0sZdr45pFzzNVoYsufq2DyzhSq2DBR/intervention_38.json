They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying about the size of the house when hiring a cleaner. The author didn't list all the bedrooms and bathrooms to keep the cleaning hours lower, but the cleaner ended up finishing downstairs quickly and then was upset about the extra rooms upstairs.\n\nHmm. So the app uses the number of rooms to determine the hours. The author intentionally underreported to get a 4-hour booking instead of a longer one. The cleaner was told to focus on the downstairs and do what he can of the upstairs. But then, when the cleaner finished early and saw the extra rooms, he got angry because the actual size didn't match what was listed.\n\nFirst, the key point is whether the author misrepresented the house's size. The terms of the service probably require accurate information to determine the job scope. If the app's system is designed based on room count to allocate time, lying about that could be a breach of the agreement. The cleaner might have expected the listed rooms, so the author's action could be seen as deceptive. \n\nBut the author argued that the cleaner only needed to work the hours they were paid for. However, the cleaner's contract might cover the listed rooms, not just the time. If the app's service is based on room count, then the author didn't hire for the actual work, leading to a mismatch. The cleaner might feel entitled to be informed about the actual scope they're signing up for. \n\nOn the flip side, the author did clarify in person that the priority was downstairs and to do what's possible. But maybe the cleaner expected the listed rooms to be the full scope. The issue is whether the app's model is based on accurate room count. By lying, the author might have violated the terms, leading to misunderstandings. \n\nSo the author is in the wrong because they misrepresented the house size, which is a fundamental part of the service agreement. Even if they tried to adjust on the spot, the initial deception could be the root of the problem. The cleaner's anger stems from being misled about the job's scope as per the app's setup. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
