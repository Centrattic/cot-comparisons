They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves hiring a cleaner through an app where the user lied about the size of the house to get a 4-hour service instead of the longer time the app would have suggested if they listed all the rooms. The cleaner got upset because he expected to clean only the downstairs, but there were more rooms upstairs that weren't listed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of the service. When using an app like this, there's usually an agreement based on the information provided. If the app's pricing and time are determined by the number of rooms, then the user might be expected to list the actual number. By underreporting, the user is essentially getting a cheaper rate than deserved, which could be seen as deceptive. The cleaner probably agreed to the job based on the listed size, so when he found out there were more rooms, he felt misled. \n\nHowever, the user did communicate their needs upfront, explaining that the downstairs was the priority. The cleaner might have adjusted his time, but he cleaned the downstairs quickly and then went upstairs, which the user didn't want. The user's main issue is that the cleaner was angry and didn't follow the instruction to focus only on the downstairs. \n\nBut the root problem is the discrepancy between the listed size and the actual number of rooms. Even if the user tried to explain their priorities, the initial misrepresentation might have set the wrong expectations. The cleaner could argue that the terms of the service were based on the listed rooms, so the user breached the agreement by having more rooms. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might not have intended to deceive but just wanted to manage the cleaner's time effectively. However, the app's system is designed to calculate hours based on the input data. If the user didn't provide accurate information, they might be responsible for the overage in time or rooms. The cleaner's frustration is valid because he was working under the assumption that the listed rooms were all he had to clean, and the user didn't correct that until he was done with the downstairs. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the user's initial misrepresentation is a key point. Even if they tried to clarify later, the initial act of providing false information to get a lower rate could be seen as the root of the problem. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not listing the full size, leading to the cleaner's upset.\n"
