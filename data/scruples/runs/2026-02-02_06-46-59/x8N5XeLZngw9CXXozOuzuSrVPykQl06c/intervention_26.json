I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who has a court-ordered every weekend visitation is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend. The other parent, the ex, wants the non-custodial parent to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The current arrangement is 8 days a month for the author and 22 days for the ex.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. Unless modified by the court, both parties are supposed to follow it. The ex is asking the author to change the schedule without court approval. The author's time is limited, and they value the scheduled weekends. The ex's argument is that she's busy with school, but she already has the majority of the time. \n\nI need to consider family law principles. Courts generally aim for equitable time-sharing, but once a schedule is set, changes require mutual agreement or a court modification. The author isn't obligated to change unless the court says so. The ex's request might be reasonable, but the author isn't in the wrong for not complying without a court order. The key is that the author isn't violating the court order by maintaining their schedule. The ex would need to go through the legal process to request a modification. So the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
