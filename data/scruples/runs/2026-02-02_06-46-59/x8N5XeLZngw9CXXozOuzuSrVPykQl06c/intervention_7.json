I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author feels they already get 8 days a month, and the mother has 22. They don't want to lose any time.\n\nFirst, the court order is in place. That's a legal document. The mother is asking the father to give up time outside the court order. The father not agreeing isn't necessarily wrong because the court order is the legal framework. The mother's reason is that she's in school, but the father is concerned about his limited time. \n\nBut wait, the court order is supposed to be fair. If the court has already determined the custody arrangement, maybe the mother should request a modification through the court if her circumstances have changed. She can't just ask the father to agree to it without legal process. \n\nThe father's stance is that he doesn't want to lose time. Since the court order is in place, the father isn't in the wrong for not complying with her request. Unless there's a legal challenge, the court order stands. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
