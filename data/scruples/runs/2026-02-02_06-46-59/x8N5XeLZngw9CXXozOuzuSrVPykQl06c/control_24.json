I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, totaling about 8 days a month. The other parent wants every second weekend, which would reduce the first parent's time to 4 days a month. The other parent has the child 22 days a month and is in school, making time management hard.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If the original custody arrangement was set by a court, the parent can't unilaterally change it without the court's approval. The other parent's request to take every second weekend would mean altering the existing order. The parent in question is resisting that change because they value their time with the child. \n\nThe key points here are the legal standing of the court order and the reasons behind the other parent's request. The other parent has more time with the child already, so asking for even more might not be fair, especially if the court order was meant to balance both parents' time. Also, the parent's objection is about maintaining their scheduled time, which they look forward to. \n\nSince the court order is in place, the other parent would need to go through legal channels to modify it. The parent in question isn't violating any laws by not complying with the request. They\u2019re upholding the court's decision. The other parent's request might not have a strong legal basis if the current arrangement is deemed fair by the court. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the parent isn't in the wrong. They're following the court order, and the other parent should seek legal modification if needed. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
