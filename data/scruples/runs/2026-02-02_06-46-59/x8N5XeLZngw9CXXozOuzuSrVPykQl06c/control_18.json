I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son. The other parent (the baby mother) is asking to take every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time from 8 days a month to maybe 4, while she has 22 days already. The author is resisting because they value their time with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so unless there's a modification, the other parent can't just unilaterally change the schedule. The mother's request would require a formal modification, which typically needs to be approved by the court. So if she's trying to change the agreement without the court's approval, that's a problem.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author is attached to their weekends with the son. The mother's argument is that she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. But she already has 22 days, which is most of the month. The author's time is already significantly less. It might not be fair to take away more of their time, especially if the court order was established to balance things.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"parenting time\" usually considers the best interest of the child. If the mother is in school, maybe her schedule is busy, but she still has 22 days. The author's time is crucial for maintaining a relationship. Taking away every second weekend could harm that bond. \n\nThe key here is that the mother's request isn't going through the proper legal channels. The author isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So the author isn't in the wrong for not giving up their court-ordered time. The mother is the one trying to change the agreement without following the legal process. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
