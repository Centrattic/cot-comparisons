I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is the asshole for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the parent has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is saying they don't want to give up their time because they only get 8 days a month, and the other parent gets 22.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which means the time is legally set. The other parent is asking for a change, but the author isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. The author isn't breaking the law by sticking to the existing arrangement. \n\nThen, the emotional side. Both parents probably love their child and want time with him. The mother is in school, so maybe her schedule is tight. But the father only gets weekends, which is already a significant portion of the time. The mother having 22 days might seem like a lot, but maybe the father's time is crucial for bonding. \n\nI should think about typical custody arrangements. Usually, the non-custodial parent gets weekends or alternating weekends. If the court order is already in place, the father is following the law. The mother's request is a change, which would require going back to court, not the father agreeing to it. \n\nAlso, the father's perspective is that he looks forward to the weekends and they have fun. It's important for him to maintain that bond. The mother might be in school, but the existing custody arrangement might already account for her primary care. \n\nSo, unless the court decides that the mother needs more time due to her current circumstances (school), the father isn't wrong for not giving up his time. The key here is that the court order is the current legal framework, and the father is adhering to it. The mother needs to seek legal modification if she wants changes, not the father giving up his time voluntarily. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
