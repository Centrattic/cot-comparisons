I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son, while the mother, who is in school, wants him to give up every second weekend to her because she feels she doesn't have enough time. The father doesn't want to lose any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. If the mother wants to change the visitation schedule, she would need to go through the legal system to modify the order. The father isn't obligated to agree unless the court decides otherwise. So legally, he's probably in the right because the court has already established the visitation terms.\n\nNext, the emotional side. The father is separated and has limited time with his son, which he looks forward to. The mother is in school, which might make her schedule tight, but the current arrangement gives her 22 days a month. That's a significant amount of time. The father's reluctance to give up his time is understandable as he values the weekends they have.\n\nThe question is whether he's an asshole for not wanting to give up time. The mother's request is reasonable in intent, but the father is following the court order. The key here is that the mother should pursue a legal modification instead of asking the father to agree. The father isn't wrong for not complying without a court order. The mother's approach might be flawed, but the father isn't in the wrong for standing by his legal terms.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The court order is in place, and the mother should handle it through the legal system if she wants changes.\n"
