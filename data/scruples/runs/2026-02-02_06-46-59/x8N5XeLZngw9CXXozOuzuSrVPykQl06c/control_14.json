I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. They have a court order for every weekend, which gives them 8 days a month. The baby mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. \n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document, right? So unless there's a change in custody or visitation rights through the court, they can't just alter it without proper legal process. The author is following the court order, so from a legal standpoint, they're not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the question is more about the moral aspect. The mother says she's busy with school and needs more time. However, the author is only getting 8 days, and the other parent has 22. If the court already allocated 8 days, maybe the mother is asking for more than her share. But the author isn't the one making the request; they're resisting a change. \n\nThe key here is whether the mother can legally enforce the change. If the court order is in place, the author isn't violating it by not giving up time. The mother would need to go back to court to modify the arrangement, especially if it's part of the custody agreement. The author's refusal isn't a breach unless the court changes the order. So legally, they're in the right. \n\nMorally, it's a bit tricky. Both parents want time with the child. The mother might be struggling with her school schedule, but the father is also trying to maintain his time. It's possible there's a compromise, but the author is standing by the existing agreement. Since the court order is the basis, it's reasonable to stick to it unless there's a valid legal reason to change. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they're adhering to the court order, and any changes require legal adjustment, not just mutual agreement.\n"
