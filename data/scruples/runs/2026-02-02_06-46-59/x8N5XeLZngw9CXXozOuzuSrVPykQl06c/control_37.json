I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the mother wants to take every second weekend. The key points here are the existing court order and the time distribution.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If the mother is asking him to give up his allocated time without going through legal channels, that's a problem. The court order is supposed to set the terms, so any changes would typically require a court's approval. The father isn't in the wrong for not complying with her request if there's no legal modification. \n\nAlso, the time division: 22 days vs. 8 days. The mother has more days, but weekends are usually when the father can spend quality time. The mother's argument about being in school might be a reason for her needing more time, but the father's time is fixed by the court. The father values his time and shouldn't be expected to give it up without legal changes. \n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole for not giving up his time. Since the court order is in place and he's following it, he's not in the wrong. The mother's request is unilaterally trying to alter the agreement, which isn't his responsibility. So, answer B.\n"
