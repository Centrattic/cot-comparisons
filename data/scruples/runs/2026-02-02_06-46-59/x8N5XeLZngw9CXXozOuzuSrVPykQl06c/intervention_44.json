I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son as the mother requested. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are separated, and there's a court order that grants the father every weekend to see his son. The mother is now asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and feels she doesn't get enough time. The father is resisting because he already has only 8 days a month, and he values the time he has.\n\nI need to consider custody laws, but since the user is asking for an ethical or moral judgment rather than legal advice, the focus should be on fairness and the well-being of the child. The current arrangement is set by a court, which implies it's legally binding. The mother's request to alter the schedule without the court's approval might not be enforceable immediately. However, the question is about whether the father is in the wrong morally.\n\nThe mother is in school, which might affect her ability to spend time with the child. But she already gets 22 days a month, which is more than the father. The father's time is limited, and he's not the one asking for changes. He's standing by the court order. The mother might need to seek a modification through the court if her circumstances have changed significantly, but that's a legal process. The father's refusal to adjust without a court order isn't necessarily wrong, especially since he's the one with the scheduled time.\n\nHowever, the father's stance could be seen as rigid. If the child's best interest is to have more balanced time with both parents, maybe the father should be open to negotiation. But given the current setup, the father is sticking to his court-ordered time. The mother's request is a personal appeal, not a legal requirement right now. So the father isn't violating any laws or the court order by not complying. Therefore, he's not in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
