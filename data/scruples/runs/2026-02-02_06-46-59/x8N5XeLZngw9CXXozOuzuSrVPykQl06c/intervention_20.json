I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father doesn't want to give up his scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legally binding document. If the mother wants to change the custody arrangement, she would need to go through the court process. The father isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. So legally, he might not be in the wrong for sticking to the existing order.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the father is concerned about losing time with his son, especially since he's only seeing him 8 days a month. The mother has the child 22 days, which is a significant portion. The father's desire to maintain his scheduled time is understandable. However, the mother's situation\u2014being in school and struggling to spend time with her child\u2014might also be a valid concern. But since the court order is already in place, she should probably seek legal adjustments rather than expecting the father to agree without court involvement.\n\nThe question is whether the father is wrong for not giving up his time. Since the court order exists and the mother hasn't petitioned for a modification, the father isn't in the wrong. The mother should work within the legal system to request changes. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
