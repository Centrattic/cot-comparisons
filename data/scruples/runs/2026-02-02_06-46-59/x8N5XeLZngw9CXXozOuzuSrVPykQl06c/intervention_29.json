I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their parenting time with their son. The situation is that the mother wants to take every second weekend, reducing the father's time from 8 days a month to maybe 4, while she gets 22 days. The father feels he's already getting less time and doesn't want to lose any more.\n\nFirst, legal standing: there's a court order in place. The mother is asking for a modification, but the father isn't obligated to agree unless the court changes the order. Courts typically consider the child's best interest, which includes both parents. If the mother's request is based on her current school schedule, the court might adjust the schedule to accommodate both parents. However, the father's existing time is set by law, so he's not necessarily wrong for not giving it up without a court change.\n\nEmotional aspect: The father clearly values his time with his son and they have a good relationship. The mother's request might be valid, but the father's feelings and the established schedule are also important. The current arrangement gives the mother 22 days, which is more than half, so the father's 8 days might be seen as insufficient. But the father's reluctance doesn't make him the asshole if he's following the court order.\n\nPossible factors: The mother's school schedule could affect her ability to spend time with the child, but the father having a fixed schedule by court order might mean he's not at fault. The court might adjust the schedule if the mother proves it's in the child's best interest, but until then, the father isn't obligated to comply. \n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? Probably not, because the court order is in place. The mother should seek legal modification if needed. The father's attachment is valid, and he's not violating any laws by sticking to the current arrangement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
