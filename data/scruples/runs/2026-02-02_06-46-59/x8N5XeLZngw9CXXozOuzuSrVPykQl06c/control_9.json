I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place that grants the father every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend, reducing his time from 8 to 4 days a month. She's in school, so maybe her schedule is hectic. The father is resisting, valuing his weekends with his son.\n\nThe key points here are the existing legal agreement and the balance of time. The mother already has the child 22 days a month, which is the majority. The father's time is 8 days, which is less but still a significant portion if it's every weekend. The court order is a legal document, so changing it would require mutual agreement or a court modification.\n\nThe mother's request is to take every other weekend, which would halve the father's time. The father is reluctant, which makes sense because he's been consistent with his weekends. The mother's reason is her schooling, but the current arrangement might already account for her needs since she has the child most of the time.\n\nIs the father in the wrong? Well, the court order exists for a reason. If the mother wants to change it, she'd need to go through legal channels. The father isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. The father's attachment and the child's relationship with him are important. The mother having the child 22 days a month seems like a lot, so the father's 8 days are a smaller portion but still valuable.\n\nConsidering all this, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to maintain his court-ordered time. The mother should either work within the existing agreement or seek a legal modification if her circumstances have changed. The father isn't the asshole for not giving up his time without a court order change. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
