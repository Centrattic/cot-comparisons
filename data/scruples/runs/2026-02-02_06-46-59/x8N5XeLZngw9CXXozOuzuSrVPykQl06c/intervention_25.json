I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father who has court-ordered weekend visitation is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend to the mother, who claims she doesn't have enough time because she's in school.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document that outlines custody and visitation rights. Since there's a court order in place, any changes should ideally be addressed through legal channels. The mother is requesting a change, but the father is resisting because he feels his time is limited. \n\nThe mother currently has 22 days a month, which is more than the father's 8. She's in school, which might complicate her time, but the existing arrangement already gives her the majority. The father's time is every weekend, which he values. The key point here is whether the court order can be unilaterally altered by one parent. Typically, both parents need to agree or go through the court to modify custody. \n\nThe father's refusal isn't about not wanting to share, but about maintaining the court-ordered time. The mother's request might not be legally enforceable without court approval. So the father isn't necessarily in the wrong for sticking to the current arrangement. \n\nAlso, considering the child's best interest, consistency in visitation is important. The father's time is structured, and changing it might disrupt that. Unless the court deems the mother's situation (being in school) a valid reason to adjust the order, the father's stance seems justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
