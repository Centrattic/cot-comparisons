I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement for their son every weekend. The other parent, the mother, wants to take every second weekend, which the father doesn't want to give up. The father is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to lose any of his time with his son.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place, which is important. Court orders are legally binding, so changing them usually requires going back to court. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up his time as per the current order. If the father agrees, that's fine, but he's not obligated to. The fact that the mother is in school might affect her ability to spend time, but the father's current arrangement gives her 22 out of 30 days, which is a significant majority. The father argues that he only gets 8 days a month, which is a lot less, and he's using that time to bond with his son. \n\nThe key points here are the existing legal arrangement and both parents' rights. The father isn't violating any laws by not giving up his time. The mother might have a valid reason for needing more time, but the father isn't required to comply unless the court orders a change. The father's stance seems reasonable because he's adhering to the legal agreement. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not compromising. Since the court order is in place and the father isn't breaking any laws, it's more about the emotional aspect of wanting to spend time with the child. The father's feelings are valid, and the mother's request is a separate issue that would need to be addressed legally if she wants to modify the custody arrangement. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
