I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of his time with his son. The situation is that the author and the baby's mother are separated, and he has a court-ordered visitation every weekend. The mother is now asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal agreement. Changing visitation rights usually requires court approval unless both parties agree. So, if the mother is asking for a change without the court modifying the order, the author isn't obligated to comply. The mother's request is based on her current situation, but the existing court order is in place for a reason. She might need to go through the legal process to request a modification, which would consider both parents' circumstances and the child's best interests.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly attached to his son and values the time they have. It's natural for a parent to want quality time with their child. The mother's request might come from a place of needing more time, but she already has the child for 22 out of 30 days, which is a significant portion. The author's time is limited, and he's not the one in school, so his ability to spend time isn't compromised. The mother's situation might be challenging, but the existing arrangement might already be in place to balance both parents' needs.\n\nAnother angle is the child's best interest. Courts typically prioritize the child's well-being, considering factors like stability, relationship with each parent, and their living situations. If the mother's request is due to her being in school, maybe the court would evaluate how her studies affect her ability to spend time with the child. However, the author's refusal isn't necessarily harmful unless there's evidence of neglect or harm. Maintaining a consistent schedule could be beneficial for the child's stability.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the mother's request is reasonable, and the author is being selfish. But the existing court order is a legal agreement, so the author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to a change without legal process. The mother should pursue the proper channels if she wants modifications. The author isn't violating any laws or the court order by refusing to give up his time. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for holding his ground on the visitation schedule.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place, and any changes should go through legal procedures. The mother's request is valid but should follow the proper process. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
