I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time with a child. The author has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month, while the mother has the child 22 days. The mother is requesting every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time to maybe 4 days a month.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the existing court order. If there's a legal agreement in place, the author isn't obligated to change it unless both parties agree or the court modifies it. The mother's request is about wanting more time because she's in school. But the current split already gives her most of the time. The author's stance is about valuing their limited time with the son. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is enforceable. The mother's request is a negotiation, not a demand. Emotionally, both parents might feel entitled to more time, but the current arrangement is set. The author's refusal isn't malicious; it's about maintaining their scheduled time. \n\nPossible angles: The mother might be overstepping by asking for changes without legal process. The author's right to their court-ordered time is protected. Neither parent is obligated to give up time unless agreed upon. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
