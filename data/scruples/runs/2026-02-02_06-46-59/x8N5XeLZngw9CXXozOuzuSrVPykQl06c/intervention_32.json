I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court order for every weekend, and the mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author feels that the mother already has the child 22 days out of 30, so they don't want to reduce their 8 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. Since there's a legal agreement in place, any changes would require mutual agreement or a court modification. The author has a right to their time as per the order. The mother is asking for a change without the court's approval, which might not be valid. The author's resistance is about protecting their scheduled time, which is legally set.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's the case. The key points here are the existing legal agreement, the significant disparity in time the mother already gets (22 vs. 8 days), and the fact that the mother is in school, which might be a temporary situation but doesn't justify altering the court order without proper channels. The author's desire to not lose time seems reasonable because the court order is already structured to give the mother more days. The mother might need to go through the court to request a modification if she's struggling, but the author isn't obligated to give up time without that.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're upholding their legal rights. The mother's request is outside the existing agreement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
