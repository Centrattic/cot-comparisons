I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the kid every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to balance. The author is resisting because they value their time with the child.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. That's legally binding, so unless there's a court modification, the author isn't violating anything by following it. The mother wants to adjust the schedule, but the author is sticking to the current arrangement. The mother has 22 days and the author 8, which is a significant split. The author's concern is understandable, as they look forward to their time. The mother's argument is about her current school schedule, but the court order was established at a previous time. Without legal changes, the author has the right to their time. So, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is in effect. The answer should be B.\n"
