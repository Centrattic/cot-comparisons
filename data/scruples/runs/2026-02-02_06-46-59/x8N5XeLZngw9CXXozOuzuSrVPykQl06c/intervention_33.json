I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 out of 30 days. The other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. But the user argues that the other parent already has 22 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so changing it would require going back to court. The user isn't violating the order, so legally they might not be in the wrong. But maybe the other parent's request is reasonable. However, since the court order is already structured, the user isn't obligated to give up time without a court modification.\n\nEmotionally, both parents might feel they need more time. The user is attached to their weekend visits and the child has a bond with them. The other parent is in school, which could affect her availability, but she still has 22 days a month, which is a lot. Maybe the user is justified in not wanting to give up time, especially if the court order is fair. \n\nI should also think about the child's best interest. Splitting time might be beneficial, but if the current arrangement works and is court-approved, changing it without necessity might not be right. The user isn't being selfish if the court order is valid. The answer might be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
