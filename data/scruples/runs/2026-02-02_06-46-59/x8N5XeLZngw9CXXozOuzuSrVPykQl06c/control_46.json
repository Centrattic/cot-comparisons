I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son.\n\nThe parent has a court order for weekend visits every week. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant to give up any of his time, even though she already has the child 22 days a month and he gets 8.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means there's a legal agreement. The mother is asking for a change, but the father is not obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the father isn't in the wrong for not complying unless there's a new court decision.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might be a valid reason for needing more flexibility. However, the father's time is already limited, and he's using it for bonding. The key points here are the existing court order and the mother's request for a modification without going through the legal process. The father isn't required to negotiate outside of court. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The mother should seek a legal modification if she needs changes.\n"
