I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court order for every weekend. The ex-partner wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author argues that she already has the child 22 days a month, so they get 8. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal agreement. Changing that would require going through the court system. The ex is asking outside of that, which might not be valid legally. The author isn't obligated to change unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The ex is in school, which is a valid reason for needing more flexibility. But the current arrangement gives her more days. Maybe the ex is struggling with balancing school and parenting. However, the author's time is limited and cherished, so cutting it would affect him. \n\nThe key here is the court order. If the ex wants changes, she should go through the legal process. The author isn't at fault for sticking to the existing order. The user thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the facts, it seems the author is not. So the answer should be B.\n"
