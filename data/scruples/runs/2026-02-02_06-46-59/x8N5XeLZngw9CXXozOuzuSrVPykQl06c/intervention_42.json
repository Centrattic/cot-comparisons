I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend with their son, and the other parent wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The original poster is reluctant to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so legally, the author's time is set. The other parent can't unilaterally change it without going through the courts. So legally, the author is probably not in the wrong. But maybe the question is more about moral or social judgment rather than legal.\n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author is separated and has the child every weekend. The other parent is getting 22 days a month, which is more than half the time. The author is concerned about losing time. The other parent's reasoning is about her being in school. But why is she taking every second weekend? Maybe she's struggling to balance school and her time with the child. But does that outweigh the father's right to his scheduled time?\n\nThe key here is the court order. If the order is valid and hasn't been modified, then the original parent's time is protected. The other parent should go through legal channels to request a change. The author isn't obligated to agree unless the court decides otherwise. So morally, is it wrong for the author to not want to give up time? If the court order is fair, then maybe not. The author is just holding onto their legal rights. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of co-parenting. Maybe the author could be more flexible if there's a valid reason. However, the other parent isn't proposing a temporary arrangement but a permanent one (every second weekend). If the mother's situation is temporary (school), maybe she can work around it without taking the father's time. The father is already giving up a significant portion of his time each month. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The court order is the main point here. The other parent needs to pursue legal changes instead of expecting the author to agree. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
