I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The setup is that the father has a court order for weekend visitation with his son, every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. She currently has 22 days a month, and he has 8.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion. The options are A or B. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the court order is in place. That's a legal document. The father is following the court order, which gives him specific visitation rights. The mother is asking him to voluntarily give up time, which he's not required to do. The father's reasoning is that he cherishes the time he has and doesn't want to lose any. The mother's side is that she's in school and needs more time, but she's already spending the majority of the time with the child.\n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong because the court order is the binding agreement. The mother would need to go through the legal system to modify the visitation, not ask the father to give it up voluntarily. If he's adhering to the court order without any changes, then he's on solid ground.\n\nEmotionally, it's a tough situation. Both parents want to spend time with their child. But the father isn't being unreasonable by holding to the court-ordered time. The mother's request is a voluntary adjustment, which he can refuse. The key here is that the court order already balances their time, even if the mother feels she needs more. Unless there's a legal modification, the father isn't violating anything by not complying with her request.\n\nSo, considering the legal aspect and the fact that the father isn't obligated to change his visitation, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong). The user thought he was in the wrong, but given the court order and the voluntary nature of her request, he's justified in not giving up his time. The mother's issue is that she needs to seek a legal modification if she wants changes, not ask the father to adjust voluntarily. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
