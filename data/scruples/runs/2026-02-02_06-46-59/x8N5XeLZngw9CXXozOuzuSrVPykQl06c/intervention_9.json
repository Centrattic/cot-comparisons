I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets every weekend with his son. The mother wants to take every second weekend now because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is resisting giving up any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, so if the mother wants to change the custody arrangement, she would need to go through the court system. The father isn't obligated to agree to changes without the court's approval. So from a legal standpoint, he's probably in the right.\n\nEmotionally, the father is valuing his time with the child, which is understandable. He's only getting 8 days a month, so giving up even part of that might feel like a big loss. The mother wants more time, but the current arrangement already gives her 22 days. The school situation might be a factor, but maybe there are other ways she can adjust her schedule without reducing the father's time. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe not. \n\nI should also consider if there's any fault on the father's side. Since he's following the court order and not violating it, he's not at fault. The mother's request isn't legally binding unless modified. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). The key points here are the existing court order and the fact that the mother hasn't gone through proper channels to change it.\n"
