I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with their son. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father doesn't want to lose any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. Changing it would require going back to court, right? So unless the court modifies the order, he's not obligated to give up his time. The mother's request is just a request, not a legal requirement. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong because the court order is in place.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Both parents probably want to spend time with their child. The mother might be struggling with balancing school and parenting, so she's asking for more time. The father values his weekends and doesn't want to lose them. It's a common situation where both sides have valid feelings. However, the father isn't violating the court order, so he's not acting wrong by not complying with her request.\n\nAlso, the current arrangement gives the mother 22 days and the father 8. That's a significant difference. The mother might feel she's missing out, but the father's time is structured and he's making the most of it. It's possible that the mother could adjust her schedule without taking the father's time, like using weekdays or other times. But since the court order is set, the father isn't obligated to change it without a court modification.\n\nI should also think about the child's best interest. Consistency is important for a child, so changing the visitation might not be in the child's best interest. The father's time is structured, so giving it up might disrupt the child's routine. However, if the mother's situation is genuinely difficult, maybe there's room for negotiation. But the father isn't wrong for not wanting to give up his time, especially if the court order is already in place.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because the court order is in place, and he's not obligated to change it without legal proceedings. His desire to maintain his time with the son is valid.\n"
