I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with his son according to the court order. The parent time is every weekend, which is 8 days a month for the father and 22 for the mother. The mother wants the father to give up every second weekend because she's in school and has trouble finding time. The father is resisting because he values his time with the child.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place, which is legally binding. The mother is asking for a change, but the father isn't the one initiating the request. Courts usually require both parents to agree to a modification, or if not, the court would need to adjust based on the best interests of the child. The father's objection might be valid because the current arrangement is already set by law, and changing it without mutual agreement or court approval could be an issue.\n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she's struggling with her school schedule, but the current arrangement already gives her more time. The father's time is limited, and he's using his allocated time. From a fairness perspective, the existing court order might already balance things, especially if it's been in place for three years. The father isn't violating any laws by not agreeing to the mother's request. The mother might need to go back to court to request a modification, but the father isn't in the wrong for refusing to change the arrangement unilaterally. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
