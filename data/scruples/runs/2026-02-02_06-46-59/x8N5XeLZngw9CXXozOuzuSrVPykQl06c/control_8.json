I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement, seeing his son every weekend. The ex-mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and feels she doesn't get enough time, even though she has the child 22 out of 30 days. The father is refusing to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, any changes to custody should be done through legal channels, not by mutual agreement. The father is following the court order, so legally, he's within his rights. The ex is asking outside of the court order, so the father isn't violating anything by refusing.\n\nNext, the emotional side. Both parents want time with their child. The ex is in school, which might make her schedule harder, but she still has the majority of the time. The father's time is a smaller portion but he's using it for fun activities. The key point is that the father isn't obligated to give up his court-ordered time unless the court decides otherwise. The ex needs to request a legal modification, not just ask.\n\nAlso, considering the well-being of the child, both parents should prioritize the child's best interests. However, since the current arrangement is court-ordered, altering it without legal process could be problematic. The father's refusal isn't necessarily selfish but protecting his legal rights. The ex might need to consult a lawyer to request a modification if her circumstances have changed significantly.\n\nSo, the father isn't in the wrong because he's adhering to the court order. The ex should handle the request through the appropriate legal means instead of expecting the father to just give up his time. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
