I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent (the author) who has court-ordered visitation every weekend for their son, and the other parent (the baby mother) is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage time. The author is resisting giving up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order that outlines their visitation rights. Courts typically make these orders based on the child's best interests, considering both parents' needs and circumstances. If the baby mother is now requesting a change, she would need to go through the legal process to modify the court order. The author isn't obligated to agree without a legal change. \n\nNext, the current arrangement: the author gets the child 8 days a month, and the other parent has him 22 days. The baby mother's argument is that she's in school, which complicates her time. But she already has the majority of the time. The author is concerned about losing any time, especially since they look forward to the weekends. \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, both parents might feel they need more time. But the law usually requires a valid reason and court approval for modifications. The author isn't at fault for not unilaterally changing the arrangement without legal process. The baby mother's request is reasonable in intent but shouldn't be enforced without legal steps. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should consider flexibility if the other parent is facing genuine hardships due to school. But the initial question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the court order. The baby mother needs to seek legal modification. Emotionally, the author's attachment is valid, and they're protecting their time. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
