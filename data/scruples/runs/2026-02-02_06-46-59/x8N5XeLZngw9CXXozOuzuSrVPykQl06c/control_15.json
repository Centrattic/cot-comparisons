I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend. His ex wants him to give up every second weekend because she's busy with school and feels she doesn't get enough time with their son. The key points here are the existing legal agreement, the ex's claim of needing more time, and the father's unwillingness to sacrifice his scheduled time.\n\nFirst, the court order sets the parent time, so the father is following the legal arrangement. The ex is asking for a change, but the father isn't obligated to comply unless the court modifies the order. The father's concern is valid because he's already getting 8 days a month, which is less than the mother's 22. The mother's reasoning about her school schedule might not justify altering the existing agreement without legal process. The father is sticking to his time, which he values, and there's no indication he's violating the court order. So, unless the court modifies the arrangement, the father isn't in the wrong by not giving up his scheduled time. The answer should be B (No).\n"
