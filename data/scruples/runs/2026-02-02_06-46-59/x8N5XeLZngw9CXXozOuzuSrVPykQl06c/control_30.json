I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the prompt is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son to the other parent. The situation is that they have a court order for every weekend, and the ex wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The ex has the kid 22 days a month, and the author gets 8.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the court order. If there's a legal agreement in place, then changing it would typically require going through the court, right? The ex approached them directly to give up the second weekend, but the author is refusing. Courts usually set these orders based on what's in the child's best interest, including both parents' time. If the ex wants to modify the order, she should probably go through legal channels, not just ask the other parent to give it up voluntarily. \n\nThe author's argument is that they only get 8 days a month, which is already less than half. The ex has 22 days, which is a significant majority. The author is concerned about losing even more time. From a parent's perspective, wanting to spend time with their child is natural. The court order might already be skewed in favor of the other parent, so the author's refusal could be justified if they feel it's unfair. \n\nBut maybe there's a reason for the original order. Perhaps the court considered factors like work, distance, or other circumstances. However, the author isn't the one who set the order, and changing it requires legal steps. The ex's reasoning is that she's in school, which makes finding time hard, but she's already getting 22 days, which seems like a lot. Maybe the real issue is that the court order isn't working well now because of her school schedule. But the author isn't the one to decide that; the court would need to adjust it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the court order is lawfully in place, then the author isn't violating anything by not complying. The ex needs to seek legal modification. The author's refusal isn't wrong in that context. Also, the emotional aspect is important; both parents want time with their child. But the author isn't the one who can unilaterally change the agreement. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
