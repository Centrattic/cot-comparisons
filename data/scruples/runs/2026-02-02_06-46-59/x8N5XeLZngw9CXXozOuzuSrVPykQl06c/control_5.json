I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend to the other parent.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. Both parents are supposed to follow it unless they mutually agree to changes and get the court's approval. The separated parent (the author) has a set schedule, which is 8 days out of 30. The other parent is requesting to take every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time. \n\nThe key points here are the existing legal order and the balance of time. The other parent is in school, which might complicate her schedule, but the author is already getting less time. The court's decision likely aimed to ensure both parents have significant time with the child. \n\nChanging the order without court approval isn't advisable. The other parent should go through the proper legal channels if she wants modifications. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the court order. Both parents have rights, but altering the agreed-upon schedule without legal steps could lead to issues. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong because they're following the court order and not unilaterally changing it.\n"
