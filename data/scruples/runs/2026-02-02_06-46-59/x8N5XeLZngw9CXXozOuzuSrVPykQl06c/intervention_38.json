I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA question) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent has been separated for three years, with a court order that gives them every weekend. The other parent (the baby mother) is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The current arrangement is 8 days a month for the author and 22 for the other parent. The author is reluctant to give up any of their time.\n\nSo, the key points here are the existing court order, the current time split, and the request from the other parent. The court order is legally binding, so any changes would require mutual agreement or court modification. The author isn't legally obligated to give up their time unless the court order is changed. The other parent's request is based on her own circumstances, but the author's right to their scheduled time is protected by the existing agreement.\n\nNow, considering the question of being in the wrong. If the court order is still in effect and the other parent hasn't gone through the proper channels to modify it, the author isn't violating any laws by not complying. The author has a right to their scheduled time unless a court says otherwise. The fact that the current split is 8 vs. 22 days isn't inherently unfair, but the request to reduce the author's time further could be seen as unfair, especially since the court order already accounts for the other parent's more frequent time.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother's request is reasonable given her school demands. But the author's perspective is that they value their time and have a right to it. The court order's existence suggests that the time was structured to balance both parents' needs. If the other parent is struggling with her time, she might need to address that through the court rather than directly asking the other parent to give up their scheduled time.\n\nIn terms of emotional or moral responsibility, it's possible the author could be seen as not being accommodating, but legally and within the terms of the court order, they aren't in the wrong. The key is whether the court order is enforceable and if the request is made outside of legal procedures. Since the author isn't legally required to give up time, and the other parent hasn't gone through the court to adjust the order, the author isn't in the wrong for adhering to the existing schedule.\n"
