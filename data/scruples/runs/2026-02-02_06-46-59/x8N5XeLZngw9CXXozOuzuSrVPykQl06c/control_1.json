I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about child custody and visitation rights.\n\nThe father has a court order that gives him every weekend with his son. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and claims she doesn't get enough time. She has the child 22 days a month, while the father has him 8 days. The father is reluctant to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should ideally go through legal channels. The mother is asking for a change without going to court, which might not be valid. The father is within his rights to follow the existing order unless there's a modification.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother's situation with school might be challenging, but the father's time is limited. The current arrangement gives the mother the majority of the time. The father's attachment and the bond with his son are important too. It's possible that the father isn't in the wrong because he's sticking to the court's decision and valuing his time.\n\nBut wait, maybe the mother has a valid point. If her school schedule is causing issues, maybe adjusting the schedule could help both. However, the father isn't obligated to give up his court-ordered time without legal changes. The mother should probably seek a court modification instead of asking informally.\n\nSo, the father isn't the asshole here because he's following the legal arrangement. The mother's request is reasonable but should be addressed through proper channels. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
