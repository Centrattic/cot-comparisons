I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time for their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, which means they see the child 8 out of 30 days. The other parent, the baby mother, wants every second weekend instead. She argues that she's in school and has difficulty finding time, but she already has the child 22 days a month.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document, so both parents are supposed to follow it. The author isn't in the wrong for not complying without a court modification. The baby mother's request changes the existing agreement without legal adjustment. The author's time is protected by the court order. The key point here is that the court order is in place, and any changes should be made through legal channels, not unilateral agreements. The author is justified in wanting to keep their scheduled time. The mother's request seems to ignore the current arrangement. The author isn't being selfish; they're upholding the court's decision. Also, the author's time is limited, so giving up weekends would drastically reduce their time with the child. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
