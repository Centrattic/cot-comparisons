I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time with their son. The author has a court order that gives them every weekend, and the mother wants them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and says she doesn't get enough time. The author is resisting because their time is limited and they don't want to give it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The court order is already in place, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. If the mother wants to change it, she should go through the legal process, not ask the father to agree informally. The father isn't obligated to comply without a court modification. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. Both parents probably want time with their child, but the father is in a situation where he's already getting 8 days out of 30. That's less than a third of the month, which might be considered insufficient by some standards. The mother's argument is that she's in school and it's hard for her to find time, but she's already keeping the child 22 days. The father's time is fixed by the court, so he's not the one making the initial request for more time. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the father isn't at fault for not wanting to give up his court-ordered time. The mother should pursue legal channels to modify the order if she feels her needs aren't met. The father isn't being unreasonable by sticking to the current arrangement. He's not the one who initiated the request for more time. So, it's more about the mother needing to follow the proper legal procedures rather than the father being in the wrong for not complying with her request outside of court.\n\nAlso, considering the child's best interest, the court typically aims for joint custody or equitable time-sharing, but if the current order is already in place, changing it shouldn't be done unilaterally. The father's attachment to his time is valid, especially if it's a significant part of his relationship with the child. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The correct choice is B.\n"
