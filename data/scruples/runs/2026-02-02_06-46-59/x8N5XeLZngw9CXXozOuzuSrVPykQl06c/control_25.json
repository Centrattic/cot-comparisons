I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The background is that they have a court order for every weekend. The mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and claims she doesn't have enough time. The author feels like they already have less time (8/30 days) and don't want to lose more.\n\nFirst, the court order is in place, which is a legal agreement. So the mother is trying to get a change in the custody arrangement. The author is following the court order, which is their right. The mother's request is about her difficulty with time due to school. But the author is concerned about losing their scheduled time. \n\nThe key points are the existing legal agreement and the mother's new request. Since the court order is a binding agreement, the author isn't in the wrong for not complying unless there's a legal modification. The mother should seek a court modification if she needs changes. The author's stance is about maintaining their legal rights. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
