I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement. The father has his son every weekend, and the mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant to lose any of his time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If the initial arrangement was 8 days a month for the father and the mother has the remaining 22 days, that's set by the court. The father is within his legal rights to follow the order unless there's a modification. The mother changing her schedule due to school might not automatically override the court's decision. However, if she wants to modify the custody arrangement, she would need to go through the legal process, not just ask the father to agree.\n\nThe father's perspective is that he values his time with his son and doesn't want to give it up. He's been separated for three years, so he might see every weekend as crucial for bonding. The mother's argument is that she's in school and has a harder time, but she already has the majority of the time. The key here is whether the mother is adhering to the existing court order or trying to enforce a unilateral change. If she's asking for a modification, the father isn't obligated to agree unless the court decides so. So, the father isn't in the wrong for not complying with an informal request that isn't part of the legal order. However, if the mother follows proper legal channels, that's a different scenario. But based on the current situation, the father's stance is legally sound. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
