I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement, getting their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mom, is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is resistant and wants to keep all their scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, it's legally binding. The author isn't allowed to unilaterally change the agreement without court approval. The baby mom wants to modify the custody arrangement. But the author is saying no because they value their time. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The key points here are the existing custody order and the reasons for the request. The baby mom is in school, which might make her time management challenging, but she's already the custodial parent for 22 days a month. The author's time is only 8 days, which is significantly less. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the court order is the priority. The author isn't at fault for not agreeing without legal changes. Emotionally, both parents want time with their child. However, the custodial parent already has the majority of time. The author is following the court order and not willing to renegotiate without legal changes. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the court order is in place, the author isn't obligated to give up time. The baby mom would need to go through the legal process to modify the order. The author isn't being selfish if the court order is valid. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the legal agreement.\n"
