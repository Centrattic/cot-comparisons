I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend. The mother, who has primary custody, wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is reluctant because he feels his time is already limited (8 days a month vs. her 22). He doesn't want to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legally binding agreement. Unless there's a modification, he's supposed to follow it. The mother is asking for a change, but the father isn't obligated to agree unless the court decides. So legally, he's not in the wrong. \n\nThen there's the emotional and parental aspect. Both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might be a legitimate reason for needing more time. However, the father's time is already significantly less. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. Since the court order is in place, he's sticking to what's decided. The mother is the one requesting a change, so it's up to the court to adjust if needed, not him. \n\nThe father's reasoning is that he looks forward to every weekend and they have fun. That's his right as a parent. The mother's situation might be challenging, but the father isn't the one causing the problem by not giving up his time. The original arrangement was set for a reason, maybe considering both parties' circumstances. Without the court changing it, he's not at fault for not complying with her request.\n\nSo, in this case, the father isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
