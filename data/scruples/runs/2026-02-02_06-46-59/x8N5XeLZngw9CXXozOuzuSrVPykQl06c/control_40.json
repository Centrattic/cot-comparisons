I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their scheduled time with their son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the parent (the author) has every weekend with the child, and the other parent (the baby mother) is requesting every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. She currently has the child 22 days a month, and the author has 8 days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions a court order is in place. Court orders are legally binding, so unless there's a modification agreed upon by both parties or approved by the court, the existing arrangement stands. The baby mother is asking for a change without a court order, so the author isn't obligated to comply. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong by maintaining the current schedule.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The author is clearly attached to their time with the child and values those weekends. Given that the current arrangement is set by a court, it's reasonable for the author to stick to it unless there's a valid reason to adjust it. The baby mother's argument about her school schedule might be a valid reason, but that would require a formal process to modify the custody arrangement. The author isn't at fault for not agreeing to an informal change when a formal process is needed.\n\nAlso, the numbers: 22 days vs. 8 days. The mother already has significantly more time with the child. The author's share is 8 days out of 30, which is less than a third. It's understandable that the author wants to hold onto their scheduled time, especially if it's a fixed court order. The request to give up every second weekend would reduce their time even further, which might be a legitimate concern for the author.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say the mother should be more flexible, but since the custody is court-ordered, the author isn't required to negotiate outside of that. Also, the mother's school situation might be a temporary issue that should be addressed through proper legal channels, not an informal agreement.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to a court order, the mother's request isn't legally enforceable without a modification, and the time split already favors the other parent. The author's desire to maintain their scheduled time is valid under the current circumstances.\n"
