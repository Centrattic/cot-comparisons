I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) who has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the other parent (the baby mother) is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and claims she doesn't get enough time. The author is resisting giving up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which the author is currently following. The other parent is requesting a change, but the court order was established for a reason. The author isn't violating the order by not agreeing to give up time; they have the right to their scheduled visitation unless the court modifies it.\n\nNext, the numbers: the author has 8 days a month, and the other parent has 22. That's a significant difference. Even though the other parent is in school, the existing arrangement already gives her the majority of time. The author's time is limited, so they might feel that giving up even more would reduce their already small window. \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author is attached to their time with the child and values those weekends. The other parent's request might be valid in that she's struggling with her school schedule, but the existing court order was likely structured to balance both parents' needs. The author isn't obligated to negotiate without a court modification. \n\nThe key points are the existing legal agreement and the unequal time distribution. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to give up their time, especially since the other parent already has the majority. The correct answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
