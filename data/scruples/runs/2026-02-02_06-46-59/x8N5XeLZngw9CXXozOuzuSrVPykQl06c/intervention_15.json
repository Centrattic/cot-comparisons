I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son, as requested by the baby's mother. The author has a court order for every weekend, and the other parent wants the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal document. If the other parent is asking for changes, they should probably go through the legal system to modify the custody arrangement. The author isn't obligated to agree to any changes unless the court decides it. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the existing order.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, both parents might want more time. The mother might feel she's struggling with her studies and needs more time, but the author has a set schedule. The key point is that the request is made without legal backing. The author has a right to the time as per the court order. The other parent should pursue a legal modification instead of making unilateral requests.\n\nAlso, the numbers: the author gets 8 days a month, which is about 26% of the time. The mother has 22 days. Even if it's not equal, the court order is specific. The author's refusal isn't selfish if they're following the law. The mother's situation (being in school) is challenging, but the solution lies in legal channels, not pressuring the other parent.\n\nSo the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're adhering to the court order and the other parent needs to follow legal procedures to request changes.\n"
