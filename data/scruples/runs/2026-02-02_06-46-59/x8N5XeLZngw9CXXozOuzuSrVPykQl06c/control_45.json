I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about child custody. The person has a court order for every weekend to spend time with their son. The ex-partner wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to find time. The author is asking if not wanting to give up that time makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. So if the ex is asking for a change, she would need to go through the court again, right? Because the current arrangement is already set by a court. The author isn't breaking any laws by sticking to the order. \n\nThe ex is in school, which might be a valid reason for her needing more time, but the current arrangement is 22 days to her and 8 to the father. That's more than a 2:1 ratio, which is common in some custody situations. The father is worried about losing time, but the court order is in place, so maybe he's not obligated to give it up unless the court changes it. \n\nAlso, the father mentions that they have a good time together and looks forward to the weekends. The ex is asking for a second weekend, but the father doesn't want to give it up. Since the court order is the current arrangement, the father isn't in the wrong for not complying with the ex's request outside of the court's decision. The ex should probably petition for a modification rather than expecting the father to just agree. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the court order is in place and the author is following it. The ex's request is not something the author has to agree to without a court decision. The father's feelings are valid, and the court order protects his rights.\n"
