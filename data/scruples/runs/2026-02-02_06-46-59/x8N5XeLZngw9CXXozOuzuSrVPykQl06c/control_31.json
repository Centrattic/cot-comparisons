I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the child every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, wants the non-custodial parent to give up every second weekend because she's in school and claims she doesn't get enough time with the child. The non-custodial parent (the author) is resisting this change because they value their time with the son.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal aspect. The author has a court order for every weekend. The other parent is requesting a modification. But court orders can be modified if there's a substantial change in circumstances. However, the author is not legally obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing without a court modification.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical angle. The author is separated, perhaps divorced, and the child is 3 years old. The other parent is in school, which might affect her ability to manage her time. But the custody split is 22/8, which is a significant majority. The author's time is 8 days a month, which is about 25% of the time. The other parent is asking to take half of the non-custodial parent's time (every second weekend), reducing their time from 8 to 4 days a month. That's a 50% reduction. The author feels strongly about not losing any time, which is understandable given the limited schedule they already have.\n\nThe key points here are the existing court order, the request by the other parent without legal modification, and both parents' perspectives. The other parent's argument is about her own time, but she's the one with the majority of days. The author is maintaining their court-ordered time, which is their right unless the court changes it. Since the other parent hasn't gone through the legal process to modify the order, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the current arrangement.\n\nAdditionally, the author's emotional attachment and the child's relationship with them are important. The child being 3 years old means consistent time with both parents is beneficial, but the author is already complying with the existing order. The other parent's situation (school) might be a factor, but she's the one with more days, so maybe she could adjust her schedule instead of taking from the other parent's time.\n\nSo, considering legal rights and the facts presented, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
