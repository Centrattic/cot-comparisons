I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about parenting time with their son.\n\nSo the background is that the person has a court order for every weekend with their son since they've been separated for three years. The ex (baby mom) is asking them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with their son. She already has 22 days a month, and the author has 8. The author is resisting because they don't want to lose any time with their child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes should probably go through legal channels. The mom is asking the author to voluntarily give up time, which the author is refusing. Since the court order is the current arrangement, the author isn't obligated to change it without a court modification. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nEmotionally, both parents might be struggling. The ex mom is in school, which is a valid challenge, but she already has the majority of the time. The author's time is precious, and they look forward to it. They have a bond, and giving up time might feel like losing out on important moments. \n\nI should check if there's any indication that the author is being unreasonable. The ex is asking for a change, but the author's current arrangement is legally set. Unless there's a court modification, the author's time is protected. The ex could petition the court for a change if her circumstances have changed significantly. But the author isn't the one who needs to agree to it without legal proceedings. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for not giving up time voluntarily. The court order is the authority here, and the ex should go through legal means if she wants to change it. The author's desire to maintain their scheduled time is valid.\n"
