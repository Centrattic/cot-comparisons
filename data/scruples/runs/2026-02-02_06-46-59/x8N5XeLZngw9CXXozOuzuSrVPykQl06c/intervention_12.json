I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with his son. The other parent is asking him to give up every second weekend because she feels she doesn't have enough time, even though she has the child 22 days a month. The author is resisting giving up his weekend time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal agreement. Changing that would require some form of modification through the court system, right? So if the other parent is asking outside of legal channels, the author isn't obligated to comply. Legally, he's protected by the court order.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Both parents love their child and want time with him. The mother is in school, which might make her schedule tough. But she already has the majority of the time. The author's concern is about not losing any time, which is understandable since he's only getting 8 days a month. It's a significant chunk of time for a parent, especially after separation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up his time. If the court order is in place, then he's not violating anything by sticking to it. The other parent would need to go through legal means to adjust the schedule. So, from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. Emotionally, it's a tough spot, but both parents have valid feelings. The key here is that the court order exists, so the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong. The mother should probably consult a lawyer if she wants changes. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the court order is in place, and the author isn't obligated to modify it without legal process.\n"
