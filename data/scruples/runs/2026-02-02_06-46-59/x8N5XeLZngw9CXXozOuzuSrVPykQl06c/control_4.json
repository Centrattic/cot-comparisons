I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not giving up every second weekend with their son to the other parent. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is separated from the mother of their child, and they have a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The mother is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author feels they already get 8 days a month (about 25%) while the mother gets 22 days, and they don't want to reduce their time.\n\nSo, I need to consider custody laws. Generally, courts aim for the child's best interest, and equal or near-equal time is often promoted if feasible. But this is a court order already in place. The mother is asking to unilaterally change it without court approval. The father isn't necessarily required to agree unless the court modifies the order. \n\nThe father's argument is that the current arrangement is fair, and he's not willing to give up any time without legal changes. The mother's side is that her schedule is busy with school. But since there's a court order, the mother can't just take the child without the father's consent unless the court modifies the order. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father isn't in the wrong for standing by his court-ordered time. The mother needs to go through the court to request changes. The father isn't obligated to agree to changes outside the court. The key point is that the court order is the legal framework here. So, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong) because he's adhering to the existing legal agreement and not giving up time without a court modification.\n"
