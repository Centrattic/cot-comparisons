I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their time with their son. The situation is that the author has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the child every weekend. The mother is asking for every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. She already has 22 out of 30 days, and the author has 8. The author is resisting giving up any time because they value the weekends and look forward to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider custody agreements. If there's a court order in place, it's legally binding. The mother is asking the author to voluntarily give up some time, which isn't required unless the court modifies the order. The author isn't obligated to comply unless there's a legal change. The mother's reason is that she's in school, but she already has 22 days, which is a significant portion. The author's concern is about losing time with their child, which is natural. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order remains in effect. However, if the mother wants to adjust the custody arrangement, she should go through the legal process, not ask the author directly. The author isn't required to negotiate outside of court. The mother's request is reasonable, but the author isn't obligated to agree unless the court modifies the order. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe if there's a possibility of the mother having more time through the court, but the question is about the author's refusal without court modification. So B is correct.\n"
