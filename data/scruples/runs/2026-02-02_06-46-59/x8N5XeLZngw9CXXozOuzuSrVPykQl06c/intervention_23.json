I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their every second weekend with their son. The situation is that the author has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the child every weekend, and the mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author feels they already have 8 days a month and the mother has 22, so they don't want to give up any more time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so changing it would require legal steps. The mother wants to modify the arrangement, but the father is resisting. The father's point is that his time is already limited, and the mother has the majority of the time. The mother's reasoning is that she's busy with school, but the father is concerned about losing his scheduled time. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the court order is a binding agreement. Without a court modification, the father isn't obligated to give up his time. The mother would need to go through the legal process to request a change. The father isn't wrong for following the court order. \n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The father values his weekends and the bond with his son. The mother is trying to balance school and parenting. However, the father's refusal isn't unreasonable if the mother hasn't legally modified the custody. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but considering the legal framework, the author is within their rights. The answer should be B (not in the wrong) because the father is adhering to the court order and has a valid concern about his limited time. The mother's request is reasonable, but the father isn't obligated to comply without legal changes.\n"
