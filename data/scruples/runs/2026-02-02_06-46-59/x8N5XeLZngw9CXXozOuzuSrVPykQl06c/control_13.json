I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. They have a court order that gives them every weekend. The ex wants every second weekend because she's in school and struggling to find time. She currently has 22 days a month, and the father has 8. He's not willing to give up any of his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would require legal adjustments. The ex is asking for a modification, but the father is against it. Legally, unless there's a significant change in circumstances, the court order stands. The ex is in school, which might be a valid reason, but the father isn't obligated to agree without a court decision.\n\nEmotionally, both parents probably want time with their child. The mother might feel overwhelmed with school and parenting, hence needing more time. The father values his limited time and doesn't want to give up any. The question is whether his refusal makes him the asshole. \n\nIn terms of fairness, 22 vs. 8 days a month is already a significant difference. The father's time is every weekend, which is a common custody arrangement. If the mother is asking to take every other weekend, that would reduce his time by about half. But the court order is in place for a reason, maybe to ensure he has consistent time. \n\nThe father isn't in the wrong if the court order is valid. The mother should go through the legal system to request a modification. The father isn't obligated to comply without a court's approval. So, he's not being an asshole for sticking to the existing agreement. The answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
