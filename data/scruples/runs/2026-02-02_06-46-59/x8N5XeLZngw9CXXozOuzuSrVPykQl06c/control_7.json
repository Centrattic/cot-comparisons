I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son, as requested by the child's mother. The situation is that they have a court order for every weekend, and the mother wants the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and claims she doesn't get enough time. The author feels they're already getting 8 out of 30 days, while the mother gets 22, and they don't want to lose their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order. Court orders are legally binding, so changing them typically requires going back to court. If the mother is asking the author to voluntarily give up time without a court modification, the author isn't obligated to do so. The court order is there to ensure both parents have their time, so the author isn't in the wrong by sticking to it unless there's a legal change.\n\nNext, the time split. The mother gets 22 days a month, which is more than the 8 the author gets. Even if the mother is in school, the current arrangement might already be structured to balance their needs. The author's time is every weekend, which is 8 days, and the mother has 22. The author is already getting much less time, so giving up even more might not be fair. The mother's request could be seen as unreasonable if the court order is already set that way.\n\nThen, there's the emotional aspect. The author looks forward to their weekends with the son and they have fun together. The author's feelings matter, and they deserve to have their time with their child. The mother's request might be coming from a place of needing more time, but the author's refusal isn't selfish; it's about maintaining their bond and the time they have.\n\nAlso, the mother mentioned she's in school, but if the court order was established when the author was separated right after the child was born, maybe the original custody arrangement was designed with both parents' schedules in mind. If the mother's school schedule is part of the reason now, maybe she should petition the court to adjust the custody, not ask the author to give up time voluntarily.\n\nSo, considering the legal framework, the existing court order, the time split, and the emotional impact, the author isn't in the wrong. The mother's request is outside the court's decision, and the author is right to hold their ground without legal changes. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
