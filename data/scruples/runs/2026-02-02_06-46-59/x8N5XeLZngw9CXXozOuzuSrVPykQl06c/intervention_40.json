I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son, and the mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and has less time. The father doesn't want to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's a court order in place, changing the custody arrangement would typically require going through the court. The mother wants to alter the existing agreement, but the father is resisting. The court orders are usually based on the best interests of the child, so unless there's a legitimate reason to modify it, the father isn't obligated to comply with her request outside of the court's decision.\n\nNext, the fairness of the current arrangement. The father has 8 days a month, and the mother has 22. The user initially thought the father is in the wrong but now is unsure. The key points here are that the court order is in place, and the mother's request is unilaterally changing the terms. The father has a right to the time as per the court's decision. The mother's argument about her school schedule might be a valid reason, but she should seek a legal modification instead of asking the father to agree.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: both parents want time with their child. The father values his weekends, and the mother is struggling with her schedule. However, the legal standing is crucial here. Unless the court modifies the order, the father isn't in the wrong by not agreeing to the change. The mother needing to adjust the schedule doesn't automatically mean the father is wrong for holding to the court's terms.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the court order is binding, and the father isn't required to give up his time without a legal change. The mother should pursue a court modification if she needs the adjustment.\n"
