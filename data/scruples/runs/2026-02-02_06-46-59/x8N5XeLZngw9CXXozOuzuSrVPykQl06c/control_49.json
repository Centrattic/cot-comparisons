I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about parental time with their son after separation. The father has a court order for every weekend visitation. The mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she feels she doesn't have enough time, especially since she's in school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order outlining his visitation rights. Changing the custody arrangement would typically require going back to court. The mother's request seems to be an attempt to modify the existing order without legal process. If the father refuses, he's not violating the court order, so he's within his rights legally.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which complicates her availability. However, the father's time is limited to weekends, and he's not willing to give up any of that. The court order was established after the birth, so maybe it's an existing arrangement. The father's attachment to his weekends is valid, and the mother's request might not consider his feelings or the existing legal structure.\n\nThe user is the father and feels conflicted. He's not the one breaking the court order by refusing the request. The mother should either adjust her schedule within the existing arrangement or seek a legal modification. The father isn't in the wrong for sticking to the court-ordered time. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
