I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time for a child. The separated parent (the author) has a court order for every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author feels they already have 8 days a month, while the mother has 22. The author doesn't want to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal agreement. The mother is asking to modify the arrangement. Without consulting the court, changing the custody terms could be problematic. The author isn't legally obligated to give up time unless the court modifies the order. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. Both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, so maybe she has a valid reason for needing more time. But the author is also attached and has a set schedule. The mother's request is significant\u2014halving the author's time. The author's response is understandable; losing time with the child is a big deal.\n\nAlso, the current split is 8 vs. 22 days. The mother's request would reduce the author's time by half. That's a major change. The author has a right to maintain their time unless the court decides otherwise. The mother should probably approach the court for a modification instead of asking the other parent.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're adhering to the court order and protecting their time. The mother's request isn't reasonable without legal changes. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
