I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son, and the other parent wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and needs more time. The author doesn't want to give up any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, so changing the arrangement would require legal procedures. The author isn't obligated to agree to this change without the court's approval. So legally, he's probably not in the wrong.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother has 22 days a month, which is the majority, but the father has 8 days. The mother's argument is that her school schedule makes it hard, but she still has the majority. The father values his time and isn't willing to give it up. \n\nThe key points are the court order, the existing schedule, and the parents' requests. Since the father isn't legally required to agree, and the mother is making a new request that's not part of the court order, the father's refusal isn't wrong. The mother would need to go through legal channels to modify the order. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because the court order is binding, and he's not obligated to change it without legal process. The mother's request is reasonable, but the father's stance is justified under the current agreement.\n"
