I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time with their son. The father has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend, so she can have him more. She has 22 days, so if he gives up every other weekend, that would add up to 4 days a month to her, making her have 26 days and him 4. But the court order is in place, so he's not supposed to give up time without a court modification.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. Changing custody terms usually requires the court's approval. The father is following the court order, which is his right. The mother might not have the legal standing to request changes unilaterally. But the father's question is about morality, not just legality. However, if the court order is in place, then the father isn't wrong for sticking to it. \n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. But she already has 22 days, which is a significant amount. The father's time is limited, and he's using it to bond with his son. The question is whether it's unfair for him to want to keep his scheduled time. From a moral standpoint, if the court order isn't being challenged, the father isn't in the wrong for not giving up time. The mother should go through legal channels to seek a modification. So the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
