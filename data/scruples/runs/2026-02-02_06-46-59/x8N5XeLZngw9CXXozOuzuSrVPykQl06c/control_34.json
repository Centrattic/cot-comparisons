I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a father who has court-ordered custody every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with their son. The father doesn't want to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order that specifies his visitation rights. Courts usually create these orders to ensure both parents can maintain a relationship with their child unless there's a valid reason to modify it. The mother is asking him to change the arrangement without court approval. So legally, the father isn't obligated to agree unless there's a formal modification of the order.\n\nThen, there's the emotional aspect. The father values his weekend time with his son, which is understandable. Parents often form strong bonds through regular visits. The mother's request might stem from her own challenges, like being in school, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father is in the wrong for not wanting to reduce his time. However, the mother's situation could be valid if she's struggling to balance school and parenting. But the key here is that the existing court order already gives her the majority of the time (22 days vs. 8). The father's time is a smaller portion, but it's still a significant part of his weekends.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The mother approached him at drop-off, but maybe she should have discussed this earlier or gone through the legal system to request a modification. The father has a right to his court-ordered time unless there's a mutual agreement or a court order changes it. The father's refusal isn't necessarily selfish; it's about maintaining his bond with his child.\n\nPossible counterpoints: If the mother's request is due to an emergency or drastic change in circumstances, maybe she could seek a court modification. But there's no mention of that here. The father isn't violating any laws by not complying with her request. So, he's not in the wrong for sticking to the court order. The mother might be trying to adjust the schedule informally, which isn't valid without legal changes.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people might be divided. Some might think the mother is being reasonable, others might support the father's right to his time. But legally and based on the information given, the father isn't in the wrong. He's following the court order and has the right to his visitation. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
