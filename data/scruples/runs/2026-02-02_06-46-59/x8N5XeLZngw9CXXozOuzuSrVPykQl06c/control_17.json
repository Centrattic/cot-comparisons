I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a separated parent who has court-ordered visitation every weekend with their son. The mother is requesting to take every second weekend, arguing that she doesn't get enough time because she's in school. The father is resisting because he only gets 8 days a month and values his time highly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. He has a court order in place, which is a binding legal document. The mother's request to alter the custody arrangement isn't something either of them can just agree to on their own; it would require a modification of the court order. Courts typically require a significant change in circumstances to alter custody. The mother's being in school might be a factor, but does that constitute a substantial change? Maybe not enough on its own.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. Both parents have a right to a relationship with their child. The father is worried about losing time, which is understandable given his current schedule. The mother's argument is that she's struggling with her school schedule, but she already has the child for 22 days. The father's time is a small fraction, so it's reasonable he'd want to maintain it. However, the mother's need for more time could have valid reasons, like stress from school affecting her ability to spend time with the child.\n\nAlso, the dynamics of co-parenting. Communication is key, but the father isn't obligated to give up his time unless the court modifies the order. The mother approaching him at drop-off might be an attempt to negotiate, but he's under no obligation to agree. The father's stance is about upholding the court order and protecting his time, which is his right.\n\nAre there any cultural or societal norms to consider? In many places, courts aim for balanced parenting time unless there's a reason to do otherwise. However, since the current arrangement is set by the court, changing it without legal proceedings could be seen as against the father's rights. The father isn't being selfish for wanting to maintain the status quo, especially if the court deemed it fair initially.\n\nIs there any nuance I'm missing? Maybe the mother's school schedule is causing significant hardship for the child? If so, that might be a valid reason, but the question doesn't provide details about the child's well-being. The father's argument is that the current split is 8/22, which is a significant disparity. If the mother wants more time, maybe a compromise could be found without taking away the father's weekends entirely. But the father isn't at fault for not giving up his time without legal changes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the father isn't in the wrong. He's following the court order, and the mother needs to go through legal channels to modify it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
