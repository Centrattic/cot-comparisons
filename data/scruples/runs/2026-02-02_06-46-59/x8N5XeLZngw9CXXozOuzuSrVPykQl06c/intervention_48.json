I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author has a court order for every weekend with their son, and the mother wants them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author is reluctant because they value their time with the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would require modifying that order, right? The mother can't just unilaterally take away the author's time without legal action. So if the author refuses, it's within their rights as per the court.\n\nEmotionally, the author is attached to the weekends. The mother has 22 days, which is more than the author, but maybe she's struggling with her school schedule. However, the author's time is fixed by the court. The mother should probably go through the legal system to request a modification instead of asking the author directly. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by holding onto their court-ordered time. If the mother wants to adjust the schedule, it's her responsibility to seek a court modification. The author isn't at fault here for not giving up their time without a court change. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
