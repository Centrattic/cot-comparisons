I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is the asshole for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month, while the other parent has 22 days. The mother wants to take every second weekend, reducing the father's time. \n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement, so the father is within his rights to follow it. The mother is asking for a change, but the father isn't obligated to agree without a court modification. The father's argument is that his time is already minimal compared to hers. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the existing legal arrangement and the father's right to his scheduled time. The mother's request is understandable, but the father isn't at fault for not complying with an informal request that goes against the court order. Unless the court modifies the order, the father isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B, No.\n"
