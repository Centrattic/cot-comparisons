I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father (the author) who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with his son every weekend. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she feels she doesn't get enough time with the child, even though she has him 22 days a month. The author is resisting and the question is whether he's the asshole for not wanting to give up his time.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so any changes would typically require agreement from both parties or a court modification. The mother's request is to alter the existing order without going through the legal process. If the author is following the court order, he's within his rights. The mother might need to petition the court for a modification, especially if her circumstances have changed (like being in school), but the father isn't obligated to agree without a legal change.\n\nThe numbers mentioned: the mother has the child 22 days a month, which is roughly 73% of the time. The father has 8 days, which is about 27%. That's a significant disparity. The mother's argument is that she's in school and it's hard to find time, but she already has the majority of the time. The father values his weekends and doesn't want to lose them. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the father isn't in the wrong if he's adhering to the court order. The mother's request isn't something he can be compelled to agree to without a court decision. Emotionally, both parents might feel they need more time, but the father's right to his scheduled time is protected by the existing order. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. If the court order was based on certain conditions and the mother's current situation (school) is affecting her ability to spend time with the child, she might need to seek a legal adjustment. The father's refusal isn't inherently wrong because he's following the law, but ideally, parents should try to work together for the child's best interest. But since the mother hasn't gone through the legal process, the father isn't at fault for sticking to the current arrangement. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's following a court order, and the mother's request isn't legally enforced yet. The problem lies with the mother not going through the proper channels to modify the order.\n"
