I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some weekend time with their son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the author gets every weekend, and the mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order that specifies their visitation rights. Courts usually establish these orders based on what's in the child's best interest. If the mother wants to change the arrangement, she would typically need to go through the legal system to modify the order. The author isn't obligated to agree to changes without a court's approval because that could undermine the existing custody agreement.\n\nNext, the numbers: the author gets 8 days a month, which is about 26% of the time. The mother has 22 days. Even if she's in school, the existing schedule might already be structured to balance both parents' availability. The author is concerned about losing time, which is understandable since they look forward to those weekends. However, the mother's argument is about her own challenges, but her current schedule already allows her more time. \n\nThe key point here is that the court order is in place for a reason. The author isn't at fault for not unilaterally altering the arrangement without legal changes. The mother should pursue legal channels if she wants modifications. The author's refusal isn't selfish if it's about maintaining the court-ordered schedule. So, based on this reasoning, the answer would be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
