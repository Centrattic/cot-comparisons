I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who's separated from the baby's mother and has court-ordered weekend visitation. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend to her because she's in school and says she doesn't get enough time. The father is resisting because he only gets 8 days a month and doesn't want to lose any time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. Unless the court modifies the order through proper legal channels, he isn't obligated to give up his court-ordered time. So legally, he's in the right. The mother wanting more time is understandable, but that doesn't mean the father has to give up his time without a court's approval.\n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might make her time management harder. But the father already has a set schedule. The father's attachment is also valid; he's looking forward to the weekends and they have fun. It's a parent's right to bond with their child.\n\nSocial norms and custody arrangements usually consider the child's best interest. If the mother is struggling, maybe she can adjust her schedule without taking away the father's time. The court order is in place for a reason, possibly to ensure both parents have time. Changing it without legal steps might not be fair.\n\nSo putting it all together, the father isn't in the wrong. He's following the court order and doesn't have an obligation to modify it without legal changes. The mother needs to address the issue through the proper legal system if she wants modifications. The answer should be B.\n"
