I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has court-ordered visitation with his son every weekend, and the mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds time hard. The father is reluctant to give up his time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order for every weekend. Courts usually set custody arrangements based on the child's best interest, so changing it without a court's approval might not be valid. The mother's request could be reasonable if her schedule is tight, but the father's existing rights are protected by the current order.\n\nEmotionally, the father is attached to his time with the son, which is understandable. The mother argues she has the kid 22 days out of 30, so maybe she's the primary caregiver. But the father's 8 days are part of a legal agreement. The mother might be overstepping by asking for a change without going through legal channels. \n\nThe father isn't necessarily in the wrong just for not wanting to relinquish his time. The court order is in place, and he's following it. The mother should probably seek a legal modification if her situation has changed. The father's refusal isn't being selfish if it's within the terms of the court order. So, the answer would likely be B (No). But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. Maybe if the father's time is causing issues or if the mother's situation is urgent. But given the info, the father's stance is valid. So, B.\n"
