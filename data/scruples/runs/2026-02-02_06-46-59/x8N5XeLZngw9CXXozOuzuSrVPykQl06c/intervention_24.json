I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The author is resisting giving up any of their time because they really look forward to the weekends and have fun with their son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the current custody arrangement is legally binding. The mother is requesting a change, but the court order isn't being followed unless modified. The author is within their rights to not comply unless the court changes the order. So legally, the author isn't wrong.\n\nEmotionally, both parents probably want time with their child. The mother might feel she's struggling with school and needs more time, but the father's time is limited. The father's attachment to the weekends, especially since he's been separated for three years, is significant. He might be using that time to bond and build a relationship with his son.\n\nHowever, the mother's request might be based on her current challenges. If she's in school, maybe her schedule is tight, but the existing custody arrangement already gives her 22 days a month. The father is being asked to give up 8 days to 4 days, which is a big cut for him. The key here is whether the mother's request is reasonable given the existing court order.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, both parents should prioritize the child's best interest. But if the court order is already in place, changing it requires mutual agreement or a court modification. The father isn't obligated to agree without a court order. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the wrong. Emotionally, it's a tough spot, but the father's stance is understandable given the legal framework.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the court order is in place and the father isn't obligated to give up his time without a legal modification. The mother's request doesn't override the existing custody arrangement.\n"
