I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time. The father has a court-ordered weekend visitation every week. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with their son. The father is resistant because he only gets 8 days a month and values that time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. If the mother wants to change the arrangement, she should go through formal legal channels, not just ask the father. The father has a right to his scheduled time as per the court order. The mother's request is essentially asking him to modify the agreement without legal approval. \n\nThe father isn't obligated to agree unless the court changes the order. His reluctance to give up time isn't unreasonable, especially since he's been separated for three years and probably cherishes the time he has. The mother's claim that she gets 22 days a month is significant, but the father's time is fixed by the court. \n\nThe key point here is that the mother is trying to alter the existing legal arrangement without following the proper process. The father isn't in the wrong for not complying with an informal request. The mother should seek a legal modification if she wants changes. So the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong.\n"
