I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. The father has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month, while the mother has 22 days. The mother is asking for every second weekend, so maybe 4 days instead of 8, to have more time. The father is resisting because he values that time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so changing it would require a legal process. The mother can't just take away the father's time without the court modifying the order. So, if the father is refusing to give up his time as per the current order, he's in his rights. But maybe the mother is trying to negotiate, but he's not obliged to agree. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The father is clearly attached to his son and looks forward to the weekends. The mother is in school, so maybe her schedule is busy, but the current arrangement gives her the majority of the time. The father's time is a smaller portion, but he's not willing to give it up. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the court order is valid, he's not in the wrong legally. But maybe there's a moral angle. Does he have a responsibility to give more time because the mother is struggling? But she already has 22/30 days. Maybe the father is justified in not wanting to lose his time. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I need to consider if that's accurate. The mother's request is to take away half of his time, which is significant. The father's refusal is based on the court order and his own attachment. So, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the court order is the key factor here. The father isn't violating anything by not complying with the mother's request outside the court's decision.\n"
