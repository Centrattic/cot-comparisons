I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the mother has the child 22 days a month, and the father has him 8 days. The mother wants to take every second weekend, reducing the father's time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document. Changing custody terms typically requires a court's approval. If the mother is asking outside of court, the father isn't obligated to comply without a legal change. So legally, he's probably not in the wrong for sticking to the order.\n\nNext, the emotional and relational side. The father clearly values his time with the son and has a bond. The mother is in school, which might make her time management harder, but she already has the majority of the days. The father's refusal could lead to tension, but it's also his right to protect his scheduled time. \n\nThe mother's request might be reasonable if the court order is flexible, but without a legal change, the father isn't violating anything. The key points are the existing court order and both parents' rights to their scheduled time. The father isn't obligated to negotiate unless legally required. So, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because he's adhering to the court's decision, and any changes should go through legal channels.\n"
