I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) who has court-ordered visitation every weekend with his son after a separation from the mother. Now the mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and says she doesn't get enough time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which is a legal agreement. The other parent is asking to modify the arrangement. In many jurisdictions, modifying custody or visitation requires going through the court, not just one parent changing it. So if the mother is asking outside of the court process, the author might not be obligated to comply. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author clearly values his time with his son, which is understandable. The mother claims she doesn't get enough time, but according to the numbers given, she has the child 22 days a month. That's more than two-thirds of the time. The author's 8 days is significantly less. The mother's argument about being in school might be a reason for needing more time, but even if that's true, she already has the majority of the time.\n\nAnother angle is the child's best interest. Courts typically prioritize the child's well-being, considering factors like stability, relationship with both parents, and their living situations. If the current arrangement is working and the child is happy, changing it might not be in his best interest. But if the mother's school schedule is so demanding that she's struggling, maybe the court would consider that. However, since the author isn't the one requesting the modification, he's just being asked to give up time voluntarily.\n\nI should also think about the initial question: the author is asking if he's an asshole for not giving up time. The mother isn't wrong for wanting more time, but the author isn't wrong for not giving it up if it's against the court order. The mother needs to go through the legal process to change the arrangement. The author isn't at fault here because he's sticking to what's legally agreed upon. His emotional attachment and the child's current happiness are valid reasons to maintain the schedule.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a cultural or societal expectation that the mother should have more time. But legally, the court order is binding. The mother can't unilaterally change it. The author isn't in the wrong for not complying with a request that's outside the legal process. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
