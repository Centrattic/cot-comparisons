I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation schedule with their son. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking to take every second weekend, which would reduce the original poster's time from 8 days a month to maybe 4. The poster is resisting and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the court order is key here. If there's a legal agreement in place, that's supposed to set the terms unless modified. The mother is asking for a change without going through the court, right? The original parent is following the court's decision, so they have a right to their scheduled time. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school, but the current arrangement already gives her the majority of the time. The poster is concerned about losing time and the bond with their son. \n\nThe question is whether the poster is wrong for not wanting to give up time. Since the court order exists, the poster isn't necessarily in the wrong by sticking to it. The other parent should petition the court to modify the order if they need changes. The poster isn't obligated to give up their time without legal adjustment. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
