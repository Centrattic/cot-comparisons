I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that they have a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the kid every weekend. The mother wants them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the kid. The user is separated from the mother, and the court order is in place. The mother has the child 22 days a month, which is like 73% of the time, and the user gets 8 days. The user is wondering if they're wrong for not giving up that time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If there's a court order, then the parent has the right to that time unless it's modified by the court. The mother is asking outside of the court order, so changing it would require a legal process. The user isn't obligated to agree to the mother's request unless the court changes the arrangement. The mother's reasoning about school might be a factor, but if the current custody is already set for her to have 22 out of 30 days, which is a majority, the user's time is a smaller portion. The user is concerned about losing time, which they look forward to. \n\nThe mother's request seems to be trying to get more time, but the user is within their rights as per the court order. Unless there's a legal reason to modify the order, the user isn't in the wrong for not agreeing. The question is whether the user is at fault. Since the court order is in place, the user isn't violating anything by not giving up their time. The mother would need to go through legal channels to change the custody arrangement. The user's stance is about protecting their scheduled time, which is valid. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
