I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets every weekend with his son, and the mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The father is resisting because he values his time with the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The father has a court order, which is a legal document that outlines custody arrangements. The mother is asking him to alter the schedule outside of the court's decision. Since the father has the court order, he's legally entitled to his time. If he changes it without a court modification, that might be a problem. But the mother is asking him to modify it voluntarily.\n\nNext, the emotional side. Both parents want time with their child. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school and has limited time, so she wants more. However, the father's time is already limited to 8 days a month, which seems less than the mother's 22. The father is concerned about losing his time. From a parental responsibility standpoint, both should be sharing in the upbringing, but the court order is in place for a reason, possibly due to the separation after birth.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. If the court order is in place, then the father isn't obligated to give up his time unless there's a legal change. The mother's request is a personal one, not a legal one. So if the father refuses, he's within his rights. However, maybe the court order could be modified if both parties agree, but the father isn't willing. \n\nAlso, the mother's situation with being in school might be a factor. If her schedule is making it hard to spend time, the court might consider that in a modification. But the father isn't the one to decide that; it's up to the court. So the father not giving up his time isn't wrong if he can't legally be forced to. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong) because he's adhering to the court order and not obligated to change it without legal proceedings. The mother needs to go through the court if she wants modifications, not ask the father directly.\n"
