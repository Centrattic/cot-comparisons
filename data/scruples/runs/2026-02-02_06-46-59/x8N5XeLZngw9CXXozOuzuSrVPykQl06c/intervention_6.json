I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get their son every weekend. The other parent wants the author to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is reluctant because they already have 8 days a month and the other parent has 22. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for not giving up their time.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The court order is in place, which legally defines the custody arrangement. The other parent is requesting a change, possibly based on her current circumstances (school). But the author is resisting because their time is already limited. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the court order is binding. Unless there's a modification through legal channels, the author isn't obligated to give up time voluntarily. The other parent could seek a court modification, but that's a separate process. The author's stance is about protecting their legally assigned time. \n\nEmotionally, both parents might have valid feelings. The mother might feel she's missing out, but she has the majority of the time. The author values their weekends and the bond they have with their son. The question is about whether the author is wrong for not sacrificing their time. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key factors are the legal agreement, mutual respect, and fairness. Since the court order is in place, the author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to a change without legal process. The other parent's request might be reasonable, but the author isn't obligated to comply without a court order. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are protecting their court-ordered time, and the other parent should pursue legal avenues if she wants a change.\n"
