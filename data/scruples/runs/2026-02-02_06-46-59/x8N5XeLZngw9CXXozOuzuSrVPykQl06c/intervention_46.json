I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody arrangements. The author has a court order for every weekend with his son, while the mother has the child 22 out of 30 days. She's now asking for every second weekend, saying she's in school and needs more time. The author is resisting giving up any of his time.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. The mother is asking for a change in the custody arrangement. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for not agreeing unless there's a court modification. But the question is about the moral aspect, not the legal. The key points are the existing agreement, the mother's current schedule, and the author's desire to keep his time.\n\nThe mother already has the majority of time with the child. The author's time is a smaller portion. The mother's reason is her school schedule making it hard to spend time with the child. However, she already has 22 days. If she needs more time, maybe she should propose a different arrangement that doesn't take away the father's time. The father's attachment and looking forward to the weekends are important for the child's well-being too.\n\nPossible angles: The father is protecting his time, which is valid. The mother might be overstepping by asking for a change without going through the legal process. But maybe the father could be flexible if the mother's needs are legitimate. However, the current split is already 22-8, which is a big disparity. The father's time is crucial for bonding. The mother might not realize the impact of taking away the father's time.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's sticking to the court order. The mother should address this through the legal system, not asking him directly. The father's time is important, and he's not wrong for wanting to keep it. So answer B.\n"
