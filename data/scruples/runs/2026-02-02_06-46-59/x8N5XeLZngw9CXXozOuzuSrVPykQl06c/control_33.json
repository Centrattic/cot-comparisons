I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where he gets his son every weekend. The baby's mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. She currently has 22 days a month, and the father has 8.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The father has a court order, which is a legal agreement. Unless the court modifies the order, he's supposed to follow it. The mother's request is outside the current arrangement, so unless there's a legal process to change the custody, the father isn't obligated to give up his time. That would mean he's not in the wrong legally.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, the father is attached to his son and values the time they spend together. It's natural for parents to want quality time with their children. The mother's situation (being in school) might make her time management difficult, but the current split is already 22 vs. 8 days. That's a significant majority for the mother. The father's resistance could be seen as understandable, especially if the court order is in place.\n\nHowever, maybe the mother is in a tough spot with school commitments. But the father isn't required to adjust unless both parties agree or the court intervenes. So, if he's sticking to the court order without being asked to change it formally, he's not at fault. The mother's request is a personal one, not a legal requirement. Therefore, the father isn't in the wrong for not caving into the request. The answer would be B (No).\n"
