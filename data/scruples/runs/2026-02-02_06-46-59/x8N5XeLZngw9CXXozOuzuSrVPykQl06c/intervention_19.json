I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement of every weekend. The other parent is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to have time with their son. The author is reluctant to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order that outlines their parenting time. Unless the court order is modified, both parents are legally bound by it. So the author isn't violating any laws by not giving up the weekend. Courts typically aim for fairness, so if the current arrangement is approved by a court, changing it without their agreement might require a legal process.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The author mentions looking forward to every weekend and having fun with their son. They feel that their time is limited, which is understandable. The other parent has the child 22 days out of the month, which is a significant majority. The request here is for every second weekend, which would reduce the author's time by about a third. That's a big chunk, especially if their time is already limited. The other parent's reason is that she's busy with school, but she already has the child most of the time. It might be worth considering if there are other ways to adjust the schedule without taking away the author's time, maybe during weekdays or other times, but the author isn't obligated to do so without legal changes.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"equal parenting time\" can vary. In some cases, one parent might have primary custody, and the other has visitation. If the current arrangement is part of a court order, the requesting parent would need to go through legal channels to modify it. The author isn't in the wrong for upholding the court order unless there's a court-mandated change.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation. However, based on the court order and the existing custody arrangement, the author is within their rights. The other parent's request is reasonable in intent but may not be justified given the current setup. The author's desire to maintain their scheduled time is valid, especially since it's already a small portion compared to the other parent.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key factors are the existing court order, the disproportionate time split, and the lack of legal obligation to modify the schedule without court approval.\n"
