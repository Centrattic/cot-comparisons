I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody or visitation rights with a child after separation.\n\nThe author has a court order for every weekend visitation. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend, saying she doesn't get enough time. The court order currently gives the mother 22 days out of 30, and the father 8. The mother is in school, which complicates her time. The father is reluctant to give up his weekends.\n\nSo, the key points here are the existing legal agreement. Since there's a court order in place, both parties are supposed to follow it. If the mother is asking for a change, the proper process would be to modify the court order through legal channels, not to renegotiate informally. The father isn't obligated to agree to changes outside of court. The mother's request might be reasonable, but the father isn't in the wrong for sticking to the court's decision. He's not the one initiating the change; he's being asked to adjust. Since the court order is active, the father isn't violating anything by not complying with the mother's informal request. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
