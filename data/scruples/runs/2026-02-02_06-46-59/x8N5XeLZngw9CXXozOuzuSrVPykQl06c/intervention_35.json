I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son. The situation is a custody arrangement through a court order.\n\nFirst, the court order is in place, which means the current visitation schedule is legally established. The baby mother is asking to take every other weekend, possibly because she's in school and finds it hard. But the author points out that the mother already has the child 22 out of 30 days, so the author's time is 8 days a month. That's a significant difference. The mother has the majority of time, so the author's share is much less. \n\nNow, the mother wants to adjust the schedule. But since there's a court order, any changes would typically require mutual agreement or a court modification. The author isn't obligated to agree unless the court says so. The mother's request might be reasonable, but the author's concern is valid because their time is limited. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know my take. I need to consider legal aspects and fairness. If the court order is clear and the mother is asking for more without involving the court, the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, if the mother's situation (like being in school) is causing her to struggle, maybe there's a way to adjust that doesn't take away the author's time. But the author has the right to maintain their scheduled time. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the existing court order should be followed unless modified. The author isn't required to give up their time without legal changes. But maybe suggest discussing with the mother and consulting a lawyer if needed.\n"
