I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent (the author) who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child during her 22 days a month. The author is reluctant to give up any of their scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions there's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so changing the arrangement would typically require mutual agreement or a court modification. The baby mother's request to take every second weekend would alter the existing schedule. Since the current arrangement is set by the court, the author isn't obligated to agree to changes without legal process. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong for not complying unless there's a court-ordered change.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. Both parents have a right to a relationship with their child. The baby mother has more days with the child (22/30) but feels it's not enough. The author's time is only 8 days a month, which is significant in terms of weekends. The author values their time and has a bond with the child. However, the baby mother's argument is that her current schedule isn't working due to school commitments. It's possible that the existing arrangement isn't meeting the child's needs, but the court order is in place for a reason, perhaps considering both parents' circumstances at the time.\n\nThe key points are the court order and the unwillingness to negotiate without legal changes. The author isn't legally required to give up time, but maybe there's room for negotiation. However, the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing. Since the author is following the court order and not legally obligated to change, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the court order was supposed to balance both parents' needs and the current situation is causing issues, maybe there's a need for adjustment. But the author isn't the one initiating the change; the baby mother is. The author's refusal to give up time unless the court modifies it would be their right.\n\nAnother angle: the baby mother already has more time with the child. If she's struggling to spend quality time during her 22 days, maybe the issue isn't the quantity but the quality of time she spends. The author's time is limited, and they use it for fun and bonding. The court order might have considered the child's best interest when established. Changing it without legal process could be seen as not respecting the original arrangement, but the author isn't at fault for not agreeing. The baby mother might need to pursue legal means to adjust the schedule if her circumstances have changed significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, since the author is adhering to the court order and not initiating the change, they aren't in the wrong. The baby mother is the one requesting a change, and the author's refusal isn't unethical unless there's a legal requirement to negotiate. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
