I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the father has a custody arrangement where he sees his son every weekend, and the mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The mother already has the child 22 days a month, and the father gets 8. He's resisting giving up more time.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so changing them usually requires going through the legal system. The mother's request is outside the current order, so the father isn't obligated to comply unless the court changes it. That suggests he isn't legally in the wrong for not giving up his time. \n\nEmotionally, both parents want time with their child. The mother is in school, which might make her time management harder, but the current arrangement already gives her the majority of the days. The father's time is limited, and he values it a lot. It's important to consider that custody decisions often prioritize the child's best interest, which might involve consistent time with both parents. However, if the current order is already structured to balance their time, the father isn't necessarily being selfish by not wanting to reduce his time further. \n\nThe mother's approach was direct at drop-off, which might not be the best way to handle such a sensitive issue. She should have perhaps discussed it with the father first or gone through legal channels. The father's refusal isn't unreasonable given the existing court order and his own need for bonding time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the father isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place, and altering it would require legal action. He's not obligated to agree to the mother's request without the court's involvement. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
