I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that they have a court order for every weekend. The mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage. The author feels they already have less time (8 vs. 22 days) and don't want to lose any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so any changes would need to be negotiated with the other parent or through the court. The author isn't in violation of the order by not agreeing to a change. Legally, they can't be forced to give up their time unless the court modifies the order. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't wrong.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The mother is in school, which might make her time management challenging. However, the current arrangement gives her the majority of the time. The author's time is significantly less, and they value it highly. The mother's request could be seen as reasonable, but the author's attachment to their time is also valid. Parenting time is important for both parents, but the existing court order is meant to balance things. Since the court order is already in place, the author isn't obligated to give up their time unless both parties agree or it's changed in court. The author's reluctance isn't necessarily selfish if the court hasn't mandated a change. They might be protecting their relationship with the child, which is crucial. \n\nSo, considering the legal framework and the emotional needs of both parents, the author isn't in the wrong for holding onto their scheduled time. The court order is the key here. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The mother's request is a negotiation, not a given right, and the author has the right to maintain their court-ordered time unless adjusted.\n"
