I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a separated parent who has a court order for weekend visits with their son. The other parent wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The author doesn't want to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, so changing it would require legal action. The author isn't obligated to agree to the other parent's request without a court modification. That's a key point. Legally, they might be right not to give up their time without it being enforced.\n\nNext, the time split: 22 days vs. 8 days in a month. That's a significant difference. The author's time is already limited, and they look forward to it. The mother argues she can't find time because she's in school, but the existing arrangement already gives her most of the time. Maybe she's not using the time effectively, but that's her issue. The author isn't responsible for that unless there's a problem with the current custody arrangement, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nThe question is about the author's feelings and their right to the time. The court order is meant to ensure both parents have time with the child unless the custodial parent is proven unfit. Since there's no indication of that here, the author isn't in the wrong for defending their scheduled time. The other parent's request seems to be based on her current circumstances, but the court order should take precedence. However, the author's response is emotional, emphasizing their desire to keep the time. \n\nI need to check if there's any ethical flaw. Parents generally have the right to their scheduled visitation. The author is not being unreasonable by not wanting to give up time unless the court decides otherwise. The mother should handle the situation through legal channels if she wants a modification. The author's resistance isn't necessarily assholeish if the court order is valid and the child's best interest is served by the current schedule. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
