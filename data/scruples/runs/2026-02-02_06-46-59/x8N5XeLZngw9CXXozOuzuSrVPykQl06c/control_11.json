I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they see their son every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, is asking for every second weekend to be given up because she's in school and needs more time. The author is resisting this request.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspect here. The author has a court order that specifies their parent time. Generally, court orders are legally binding, and any changes would typically require court approval. So if the baby mother is asking for a change without going through the court, that might be an issue. The author isn't obligated to agree to changes outside of the court's decision.\n\nNext, the custody arrangement: the author sees the child 8 days a month, while the other parent has 22 days. The author is concerned about losing even more time. From a fairness perspective, if the court deemed 8 days a month reasonable for the father, then the current arrangement is the legal standard. The mother might have her reasons for needing more time, but the father's time is protected by the court order.\n\nHowever, there's an emotional component here. The father values his time with the child and is not willing to give it up. The mother is in school, which complicates her ability to manage the child. But the father's stance is to maintain his scheduled time, which is within his legal rights.\n\nLegally, the father isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place. Morally, it's a different question. If the mother's situation has changed significantly (like moving to school), maybe she should seek a court modification. But the father isn't obligated to agree without a court order. So, unless the court adjusts the arrangement, the father isn't the asshole for sticking to the current order.\n\nAlso, considering the child's best interest, both parents should be encouraged to maintain a relationship. But the father isn't refusing all contact; he's just maintaining his court-ordered time. The mother could propose a new schedule through proper channels, but the father isn't at fault for not unilaterally changing it.\n"
