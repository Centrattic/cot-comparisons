I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation is that the parent has a court order for every weekend, which the other parent is now asking to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The current split is 8 days vs. 22 days a month.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. That's legally binding, so unless there's a court-mandated change, the parent isn't obligated to give up their time. The other parent is asking for a modification, but the original order is still valid. The author isn't violating any law by sticking to the court order. \n\nThe mother in school might be facing challenges, but that's her responsibility to manage. The father is already getting less time, and the mother has more. The father's attachment to his time is understandable; he looks forward to it and they have fun. There's no indication he's being unreasonable or that his time is harmful. \n\nThe question is about being an asshole. The author isn't doing anything wrong legally or morally. The other parent is the one requesting a change, but the father isn't obligated to agree beyond the court order. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
