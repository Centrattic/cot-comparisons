I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent who has a court order for visitation rights every weekend with their son, while the child lives with the other parent the rest of the time. The other parent is asking to take every second weekend to have more time, citing that she's in school and finds it hard to manage.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If the terms are already set, the author isn't obligated to give up their time unless there's a change through legal channels. The other parent's request is informal, which means the author isn't required to comply. The author's concern is valid because their time is limited and they look forward to it. The other parent has the child for 22 days a month, which is a significant majority. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but that might be because they assume the other parent's request is reasonable. However, the key point is the court order's enforceability. The author isn't at fault for not giving up their legally protected time. The other parent needs to go through the legal process to modify the order if she's dissatisfied. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
