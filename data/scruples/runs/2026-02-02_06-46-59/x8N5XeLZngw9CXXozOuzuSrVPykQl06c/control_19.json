I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is wrong for not wanting to give up some of his time with his son. The situation is that he has a court-ordered custody arrangement, currently getting the child every weekend. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage. She's taking 22 days a month, and the author gets 8.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspect here. The court order is already in place, which means both parents are legally supposed to follow that agreement. The mother is now asking for a change, but the father is resisting. Since the court order is a legal document, changing it would typically require going back to court, right? So if the mother wants to modify the custody arrangement, she needs to request a court order change, not just verbally ask the father. The father isn't obligated to agree without a court's decision. \n\nThe user is asking if the father is wrong for not giving up the time. From a legal standpoint, since the court order is in place, the father isn't wrong for following it. The mother's request isn't valid unless the court modifies the order. Also, the father's time is limited (8 days a month), which is reasonable for a non-custodial parent. The mother having 22 days is the custodial arrangement, but her personal situation (school) might be a reason for a modification. However, the father's right to his scheduled time isn't diminished by her current challenges unless the court adjusts it. \n\nEmotionally, the father is attached to his weekends with his son, which is understandable. The mother's request could be seen as a way to adjust her schedule, but the father isn't at fault for not complying without a court order. The key here is that the existing legal arrangement is in place, and any changes require legal process. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's legally following the court order and isn't obligated to negotiate outside of that.\n"
