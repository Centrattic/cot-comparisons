I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who has a court-ordered visitation every weekend with their son, and the other parent (the baby mother) is asking them to give up every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is resisting because they feel their time is limited.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. There's a court order in place, which means the time is already legally determined. Unless there's a court modification, the existing order stands. The mother is asking the author to voluntarily give up time, but the author isn't obligated to unless the court changes the order. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is binding.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The author is a parent who cherishes the time they have and isn't willing to sacrifice it. The mother, on the other hand, is in school and might have a valid reason for needing more time. However, the existing arrangement gives her 22 days out of 30, which is more than half the time. The author's concern is about maintaining their bond with the child and not feeling like they have to give up time without legal necessity.\n\nI should also think about common practices in custody arrangements. While flexibility is sometimes encouraged, it's not a given. The court orders are typically structured for stability, and unilateral changes could disrupt that. The author isn't being selfish if the court hasn't mandated a change. The mother's request might be reasonable, but the author isn't required to comply unless the court decides so.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The mother is approaching the author directly to negotiate, which is understandable, but the author might need to suggest going through legal channels if the mother feels her time is insufficient. However, the author isn't obligated to agree to any requests outside of the court order.\n\nIn terms of societal views, both parents have rights, but the court's decision is the key. The author isn't violating any laws by not changing the schedule. The mother's request is a personal one, not a legal obligation. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
