I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The author has a court order for every weekend with the child, and the mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with him. The author argues that she already has the kid 22 days out of 30.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal agreement. The mother is asking to change the arrangement, but the father is resisting. The key points here are the existing legal custody agreement and the mother's current situation. The author isn't violating any laws by following the court order. The mother's request might be reasonable if there's a valid reason, but the father isn't obligated to agree without a court modification.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious. I need to consider child custody laws, which typically prioritize the child's best interest. If the mother is in school and needs more time, maybe the arrangement should adjust. However, the father isn't at fault for sticking to the current order unless the court modifies it. The author isn't refusing out of malice but because of the existing legal terms. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but only if the court hasn't adjusted the custody. The father isn't violating the order, so he's not the asshole here. The mother's request is valid but requires legal process, which the father isn't blocking by not agreeing. So the answer is B.\n"
