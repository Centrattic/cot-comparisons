I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up their weekend time with their son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the author gets every other weekend with their son. The mother wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child during the other days. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which legally outlines the custody schedule. The author is following the court's decision, so legally, they might not have to give up their time unless the court modifies the order. The mother's request is essentially asking the author to change the arrangement without going through the legal process, which might not be enforceable.\n\nNext, the emotional and practical aspects. The author values their weekend time with their son, which is understandable. The mother, on the other hand, is in school and might be struggling to find time. However, the split is already 22 vs. 8 days a month. The author's time is significantly less, so giving up half of their existing time would reduce it even further. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable by not wanting to sacrifice their time for the mother's convenience.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the mother's time is already seven times more than the author's. If the author is already at a disadvantage, it's reasonable for them to hold onto their scheduled time. The mother's request might be based on her current difficulties, but the court order is meant to ensure both parents have a structured time with the child. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the mother is trying to adjust for her own challenges, but the author isn't obligated to make those adjustments unless the court agrees. The mother could seek a legal modification if she truly can't manage the current schedule, but that's a separate process. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people might empathize with the mother's situation but also understand the author's reluctance to lose the time they already have. The key point here is that the author isn't breaking any laws or the court order by not complying. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're adhering to the legal agreement and have a valid reason to protect their scheduled time. The mother's request, while understandable, doesn't obligate the author to give up their time without legal intervention. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
