I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son.\n\nThe father has a court order for every weekend with his son, which he's been following for three years. The mother wants him to give up every second weekend because she's in school and struggling with her time. She currently has the kid 22 days a month, and he has 8. He's reluctant to lose any time because they enjoy their weekends together.\n\nFirst, the court order is a legal document. If the mother wants to change the custody arrangement, she should go through legal channels instead of asking the father directly. The father isn't obligated to modify his time without a court decision. The mother's request might be valid if she can prove she needs more time and the court agrees, but the father isn't wrong for not complying with her verbal request. He's maintaining his legal rights as per the existing order. \n\nThe father's feelings are valid too. He's been separated a long time and values the weekends they have. The mother having 22 days is already a significant majority, so the father's 8 days are a minority, which might be why he's protective. The key point here is that the mother didn't suggest a legal change but rather a personal agreement. The father isn't in the wrong for not giving up his time unless a court modifies the order. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
