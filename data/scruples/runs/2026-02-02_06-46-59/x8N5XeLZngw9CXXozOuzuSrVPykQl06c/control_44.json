I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son, as requested by the baby's mother. The situation is that they have a court order for every weekend, and now she wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The parent in question feels they only have 8 days a month, which is less than her 22, and doesn't want to lose more time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which legally defines their visitation rights. Unless there's a modification of the order, the parent isn't obligated to give up time. The mother is asking for a change, but the father isn't required to comply without legal process. So legally, he's not in the wrong for not agreeing.\n\nThen, the emotional and practical sides. The father values his time with the child, which is understandable. The mother has more days, but maybe her schedule is difficult. However, the father's argument is that the current arrangement is already a significant disparity. Giving up every second weekend would reduce his time even more, which might not be fair. The father's right to parent also matters here; it's not just about time but meaningful bonding.\n\nThe mother's situation with school might be a valid reason for her needing more time, but the father isn't responsible for accommodating her schedule unless it's part of a legal agreement. There's no indication here that a court has modified the order. So, the father isn't obligated to comply with her request outside of the court's decision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The court order protects his time, and he's justified in wanting to maintain it. The mother's request is reasonable in intent, but the father isn't at fault for not agreeing without legal changes.\n"
