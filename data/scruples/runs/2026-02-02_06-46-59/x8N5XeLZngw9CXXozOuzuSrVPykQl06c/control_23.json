I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent who has a court-ordered custody arrangement where they get the child every weekend. The other parent, the baby mother, wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to manage time. The author is resisting giving up any of their time with the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author mentions there's a court order in place. Court orders are legally binding, so unless there's a modification, the current arrangement must be followed. The other parent is requesting a change, but the author is not obligated to agree without the court's approval. So, legally, the author isn't in the wrong for not complying without a court order.\n\nNext, the custody split: the author has the child 8 days a month, and the mother has him 22. That's a significant difference. The mother wants to take away half of the father's time (every second weekend), which would reduce his time to 4 days a month. That seems like a big cut. The father's argument is that he values his time with the child and they have fun together. The mother's reasoning is her schooling and time constraints, but she's already in a position where she has the child the majority of the time.\n\nEmotionally, the father is attached to those weekends and they're important to him. The mother's request might be reasonable if the current arrangement isn't working for her, but the father has a right to his court-ordered time. Without a legal change, he's not at fault for not giving up his time. The mother should petition the court for a modification if she feels the arrangement isn't working, rather than the father unilaterally agreeing to give up his rights.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, adjusting the schedule in a way that doesn't take away weekends but maybe shifts other times. But the question is about the author's refusal to give up any time. Since the court order exists, he's not in the wrong for sticking to it. The mother's request is a change that requires legal process, so the father isn't the asshole for refusing.\n"
