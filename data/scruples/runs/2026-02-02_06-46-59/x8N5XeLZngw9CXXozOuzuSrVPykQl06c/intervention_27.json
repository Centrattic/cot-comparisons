I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody time with their son. The parent has a court order for every weekend. The ex wants to take every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author is reluctant to give up any of their time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The court order is in place, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. The ex's request to modify the schedule would require going back to court, right? So unless there's a new circumstance that justifies changing the order, the author isn't obligated to comply without a court decision.\n\nNext, the numbers: the mother has the child 22 days a month, and the father has 8. That's a significant difference. The mother's reasoning is that she's in school, but she already has the majority of the time. The father is concerned about losing his scheduled time because he values it and they have a good relationship.\n\nI should think about the child's best interest. If the mother's school schedule is making it difficult for her to spend quality time, maybe the arrangement could be adjusted to allow for more meaningful interactions without taking away the father's time. But the court order is already set, so the father isn't in the wrong for sticking to it. The mother would need to present a valid reason to the court to change the order, not just ask the father directly.\n\nAlso, the father's perspective is valid. He's looking forward to the weekends and they have fun together. His time is limited, so he's not obligated to give it up without legal changes. The ex approaching him directly to renegotiate without going through the proper legal channels might be the issue here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the court order is in place, and the ex hasn't followed the proper procedure to modify it. The answer should be B (No).\n"
