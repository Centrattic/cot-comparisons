I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not giving up every second weekend with his son. The situation involves a court-ordered custody arrangement where the mother wants to adjust the schedule because she's in school and finds it hard to balance her time.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place, which is a legal document. The father is following the court's decision, which gives him 8 days a month and the mother 22. The mother is now asking for every second weekend, which would reduce the father's time. Since the court order is already in effect, any changes would typically require a modification through the court system, not a unilateral decision by the mother.\n\nThe key points here are the existing legal agreement and the rights of both parents. The father has a legal right to his scheduled time, and the mother can't just take that away without going through the proper legal channels. The fact that the mother is in school might be a contributing factor, but it doesn't negate the father's legal custody rights. The father is justified in wanting to maintain his court-ordered time, especially since the mother's request would significantly reduce his access.\n\nAlso, the father mentions that they have a good relationship and look forward to the weekends, which adds an emotional aspect. The mother's request seems to be based on her current circumstances, but the court order was likely designed to balance both parents' needs. Without a court modification, the father isn't in the wrong for holding his ground. The mother should approach the court to request a change, not ask the father directly. \n\nSo, considering the legal framework and the father's adherence to the existing order, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The mother's request is reasonable in intent but shouldn't be enforced without legal process. The father has the right to maintain his custody time as decided by the court.\n"
