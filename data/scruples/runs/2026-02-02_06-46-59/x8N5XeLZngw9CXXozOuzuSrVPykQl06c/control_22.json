I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent having court-ordered custody every weekend and the other parent wanting every second weekend because she's in school. The author doesn't want to give up their time.\n\nFirst, there's a court order in place. That's important because legal agreements are binding unless modified. The mother is asking the father to voluntarily give up his time beyond what's ordered. The father isn't legally obligated to do that. The mother's argument is that she's in school and needs more time, but the father already has 8 days out of 30, which is less than half the time. The question is whether the father is wrong for not wanting to relinquish his time.\n\nI think the key points here are the existence of the court order and the fact that the mother is requesting a change without a legal modification. The father isn't required to comply. The mother's situation (being in school) might affect her ability to spend time, but the father's time is set by the court. The father's attachment to the weekends is understandable. So, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because he's not violating the court order and is protecting his scheduled time with his son. So the answer should be B.\n"
