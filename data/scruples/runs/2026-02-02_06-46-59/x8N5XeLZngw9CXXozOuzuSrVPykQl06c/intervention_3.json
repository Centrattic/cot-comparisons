I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves custody time for a son after separation.\n\nThe author has a court order for every weekend. The ex-partner wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard. The author feels that their time is already limited (8 days a month vs ex's 22) and doesn't want to give up any time. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The court order is in place, so any changes should go through legal channels. The ex is requesting a change, but the author is not obligated to agree without the court modifying the order. So, the author isn't legally wrong for not complying. \n\nEmotionally, both parents might feel they need more time. The ex is in school, which could be a temporary situation. The author values their time and the bond with the child. The existing schedule gives the author 8 days a month, which is less than the ex, but in many custody arrangements, the non-custodial parent has less time. The author's refusal isn't necessarily harmful if the court order is valid. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could consider flexibility if the ex's situation is temporary. But the author isn't legally bound to agree. The key point is whether there's a court order. If the ex wants to modify, she needs to go through the court, not the other parent. So the author isn't in the wrong for not giving up time without legal changes. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
