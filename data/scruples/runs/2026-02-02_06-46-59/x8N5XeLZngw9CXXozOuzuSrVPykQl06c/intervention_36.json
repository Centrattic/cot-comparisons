I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not wanting to give up every second weekend with their son, as requested by the other parent. The current custody arrangement is every weekend, so the author gets 8 days a month, while the mother has 22. The mother is in school now and finds it hard to manage time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentions a court order, which is legally binding. The mother is asking to change the arrangement by taking every second weekend, which would reduce the father's time. If the court order doesn't already allow for such changes, the father might be right to stick to it without legal modification. Courts usually prioritize the child's best interest, and existing orders are typically based on that. So legally, the father isn't in the wrong if he's following the court's decision.\n\nThen, the emotional and practical aspects. The father is clearly attached to his son and values their time together. The mother's situation is challenging because of her school commitments, but she already has 22 days. If she's struggling, maybe she could look into other solutions, like adjusting her own schedule or seeking support, rather than asking the father to reduce his time. However, the father's resistance might seem insensitive if the mother is genuinely overwhelmed. But he's also not the one in the legal process; he can't just give up time without the other parent's agreement or a court modification.\n\nThe key here is that any changes to custody should be made through legal channels. The mother's request is unilateral, and the father has the right to enforce the existing order. That said, if the mother is having difficulty due to school, maybe there's a way to negotiate, like adding mid-week visits or other adjustments. But the father isn't obligated to agree without legal grounds. The child's well-being is the main factor, and if the current arrangement is working, changing it without proper process might not be fair. \n\nSo, the father isn't in the wrong for adhering to the court order. The mother's request could be based on current challenges, but she should address it through the court if she needs modifications. The answer is B.\n"
