I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a father (the author) who has a court-ordered every-weekend visitation with his son, after a separation from the baby's mother. The mother is asking him to give up every second weekend because she says she doesn't have enough time with the kid, especially since she's in school now. The author is upset about losing his time and is asking if he's the asshole for not wanting to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The author has a court order, which means the current arrangement is legally binding. The mother is requesting a change, but the father isn't obligated to agree unless there's a court modification. Courts usually consider the best interests of the child, but both parents have rights. However, the mother has more time with the child (22 days vs. 8). That's a significant difference, but the father's time is fixed by court order.\n\nThen, the emotional aspect. The father clearly values his time with his son, and the mother is making a request that affects that. The mother's reasoning is about her own constraints (school), but she's the one with more time. It's possible she might need more help, but the father isn't required to adjust his schedule unless both agree or the court rules otherwise.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The author isn't violating any law by not changing the arrangement. The mother's request is just that\u2014a request. The father isn't obligated to comply. However, the father might be seen as selfish if he's not willing to consider the child's needs. But the court order is in place, so maybe he's within his rights. But the question is about being the asshole, which is more about social judgment than legal.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider fairness and empathy. The father's time is limited, and he's not the one making the child unavailable. The mother has more time and is asking for even more. The father's reluctance might be seen as reasonable, especially since the court order is in place. On the other hand, if the child's well-being is considered, maybe both parents should work together. But the father isn't at fault for not giving up his legal time.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The court order protects his time, and he's not obligated to give up his visitation unless there's a legal change. The mother's request is valid, but the father isn't required to agree. Therefore, he's not the asshole here.\n"
