I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about parental time with a child. The author has a court order for every weekend, which is 8 days a month, while the other parent has 22 days. The other parent wants to take every second weekend, so the author would have to give up some time. The author doesn't want to.\n\nFirst, the court order is important. If there's a legal agreement in place, the parent is probably not obligated to give up time without adjusting the court order. Courts typically consider the best interests of the child, but existing orders are binding unless modified. The other parent's reasoning about being in school and having trouble finding time might not be sufficient to change the current arrangement without legal steps. \n\nThe author is looking forward to their time and values it highly. Parental rights are significant, but they are also subject to legal frameworks. Since the other parent is asking for a change outside the court order, the author is within their rights to refuse unless the court modifies the arrangement. \n\nAlso, the split is already 22-8, which is a big difference. The other parent wanting even more time might not be fair, especially if the author's time is structured and they have a bond with the child. The author's refusal to give up time without legal changes seems reasonable. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
