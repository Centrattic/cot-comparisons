I have a court order in place, that sets my parent time with him for every weekend. Baby mother approached me at drop off last night saying she, wants me to give up every second weekend to her, because she says she doesn\u2019t get enough time with him. Now I understand wanting to be with him more and all but, she already has him for 22/30 days of a month whereas I get 8/30.. Her reasoning is that she\u2019s in school right now which makes finding time for him hard but I just don\u2019t want to lose any of my time with my boy, I look forward to every weekend with him and we have tons of fun. Am I the asshole for not wanting to give up any of my time to her?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to give up some of their weekend time with their son, which is currently set by a court order. The mother wants every second weekend because she's in school and finds it hard to spend time with the child. The author feels like they already have less time (8 days a month vs. the mother's 22) and don't want to lose any.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the court order and the current custody arrangement. Since there's a court order in place, any changes to the parenting time would typically require modification through the court system. The author is following the existing order, so they aren't violating any legal agreements by not giving up time. The mother is making a request, but the author is not obligated to agree without a court's approval.\n\nThe author's stance is that they don't want to sacrifice their time with the child, which is understandable given the current split. The mother having the child 22 days a month might be considered primary custody, but the father's weekend time is likely visitation. The mother's situation with school might affect her ability to have the child, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father should adjust his time without legal changes.\n\nHowever, the mother's request could be due to her own challenges (school), but the father's emotional need to spend time with his son is also valid. The question is whether the father is wrong for not complying. Since the court order exists, the father isn't in violation. If the mother wants to adjust, she should go through the legal process. The father isn't at fault for not unilaterally changing the agreement. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
