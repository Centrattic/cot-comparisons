As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances. He mentions she has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which is rare. He's skeptical because he's heard stories of parents misdiagnosing their kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspect. The author is questioning his girlfriend's health claims. While his concern might stem from wanting her to have a less restricted diet, is it right for him to doubt her without evidence? He's also suggesting she try foods she claims to be intolerant to, which could be harmful if she's genuinely allergic or intolerant. \n\nBut wait, allergies and intolerances are medical conditions. If she's been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then it's her right to manage her health. The author's probing and friends' suggestions to secretly test her could be seen as undermining her autonomy and trust. Even if he suspects a misunderstanding, the appropriate step would be to support her in seeking a second medical opinion rather than challenging her directly. \n\nAlso, the rarity of multiple intolerances doesn't mean they aren't real. It's possible, though less common. The author's approach of urging her to try these foods could lead to health issues if she's truly intolerant. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and pushing her to consume potentially harmful substances without her consent could damage that trust. \n\nHis friends' idea of secretly giving her gluten or lactose is definitely crossing a line. Even if the intention is to test her claims, it's deceptive and could harm their relationship if she finds out. The right approach would be to have an open, respectful conversation and encourage professional medical consultation if he has doubts. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be well-meaning, but they risk violating her trust and autonomy. Doubting her without evidence and suggesting potentially harmful tests without her consent could be considered wrong. The correct answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her health decisions and is taking steps that could harm their relationship.\n"
