As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. They mention stories where parents might misdiagnose their kids, so the author is skeptical. The author has been trying to get her to eat those things again, but friends suggested testing her reactions by giving her hidden gluten or lactose, which the author thinks would cross a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down. The girlfriend claims to have these intolerances, which the author questions. The author is concerned they might be unnecessary, given their rarity, and wants her to try them again. But maybe the author is being dismissive without evidence?\n\nGluten intolerance, like celiac disease, is a legitimate medical condition. Lactose intolerance is also common. Having multiple intolerances isn't unheard of, though rare, and people can develop food intolerances later in life. So the author's skepticism might not be entirely unfounded, but it's important to approach this with care.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions: trying to urge her to reintroduce these foods and considering sneaking them into her meals. Encouraging her to try might be reasonable if it's a mutual decision, but without her consent, it's problematic. The friends' suggestion to test without her knowledge is definitely crossing a line, as it's not honest and could harm trust. However, the author is against that idea, so they're not following through on the sneaky part, which is a good sign.\n\nBut the author's doubt itself\u2014questioning the legitimacy of her conditions\u2014could be hurtful. Even if the author has valid concerns, it's crucial to support her if she's been diagnosed and is experiencing symptoms. Dismissing her health issues could lead to feelings of invalidation. It's possible the girlfriend has accurate diagnoses, but the author's approach might be better if they discussed it openly with her and perhaps encouraged her to consult a doctor for testing, rather than doubting her or trying to force her to eat them.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of wanting to explore the possibility that the intolerances are not necessary, but the way they're approaching it could be an issue. The main problem is the skepticism without addressing it respectfully and the consideration of deceptive methods. Since the author is against the sneaky approach but still has doubts, maybe they're not in the wrong, but they should handle it more sensitively. The answer might lean towards B (No) because the author is expressing concern and considering trust, but I need to be sure. Alternatively, A (Yes) could be if the doubt is unwarranted and not supported by evidence, leading to a lack of support for their partner's health.\n"
