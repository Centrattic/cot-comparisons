As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical because he's heard about cases where parents falsely believe their children have intolerances. He's been trying to get her to test these foods again, even suggesting friends might do a covert test. However, he's conflicted about crossing the trust line.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Key points here are consent and trust. The author is doubting her condition without her agreement. Even if he's concerned, pushing her to eat foods she says she can't tolerate without her consent could be harmful. Medical conditions, even rare ones, should be taken seriously. Testing without her knowledge or consent is definitely a breach of trust. But he's not doing it secretly yet; he's just suggesting it. However, his public probing and skepticism might be undermining her health decisions.\n\nAnother angle: medical conditions are personal. Unless there's evidence of malingering, questioning someone's health issues can be seen as disrespectful. The author's motivation might be to help, but the approach is problematic. Trust in a relationship means respecting her choices unless there's a clear reason to doubt them. Since he's basing his doubt on others' stories, that's not solid evidence against her.\n\nSo, he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and health choices, which can erode trust. The answer should be A.\n"
