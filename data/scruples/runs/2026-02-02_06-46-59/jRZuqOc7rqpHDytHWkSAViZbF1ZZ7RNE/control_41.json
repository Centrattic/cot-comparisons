As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's been skeptical, trying to get her to test these again, even suggesting friends to feed her those foods to see her reactions. But he's hesitant because of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend claims to have these intolerances, which can be real but might be self-diagnosed. The author is questioning their validity, possibly due to his own research or knowing cases where people misdiagnose. However, the key here is how he's approaching it. He's trying to get her to reintroduce the foods, which could be seen as pressuring her. Even if his intentions are to help, the method might be problematic. \n\nMedical issues can be sensitive. If her symptoms are real, forcing her to eat them could cause her physical discomfort. Also, trust in a relationship is crucial. If she feels he doesn't believe her, that could damage their trust. The author's friends suggested a more covert approach, which he's against, but his current approach might still be causing stress. \n\nThe author's skepticism isn't entirely wrong if there's a possibility of misdiagnosis, but how he's handling it matters. It's important to approach health concerns with empathy and respect. The answer might hinge on whether his doubt is expressed in a harmful way. Since he's trying to get her to test it again, maybe without her consent, that could be crossing a line. But he's also considering trust, so maybe he's being cautious. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have valid concerns, his actions could be seen as dismissive of her experiences. The right approach would be to support her in consulting a healthcare professional rather than conducting his own experiments. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting her condition and possibly undermining her health decisions.\n"
