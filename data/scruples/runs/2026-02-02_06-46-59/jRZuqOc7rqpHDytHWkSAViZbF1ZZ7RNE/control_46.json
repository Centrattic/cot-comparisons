As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend having three intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because they're rare and heard stories about parents misdiagnosing kids. They've been urging her to try gluten and lactose again, since she had them as a child and now claims to have developed these intolerances. Friends suggested sneaking food with those ingredients to test her, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author's skepticism might be based on valid concerns, like the possibility of misdiagnosis. It's not uncommon for people to develop intolerances later in life, though having three at once is rare. However, the author's approach is to question the validity of her claims and suggest reintroducing the foods. The key here is how they're handling the situation. \n\nThe author is trying to help by encouraging her to test her own symptoms, which could be a good thing if done respectfully. But the fact that they're doubting her and pushing her to try the foods might come across as dismissive. It's possible the girlfriend's symptoms are real, even if they were developed later. The author's friends suggested sneaking the food, which the author rightly avoids, as that's a breach of trust. But openly suggesting to try gluten or lactose could still be problematic if the girlfriend is doing it for health reasons. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel her health is being undermined. Even if the author is concerned about the validity, questioning her without supporting evidence or being disrespectful can be hurtful. The author should probably respect her dietary choices unless there's a medical reason to doubt them. The line between concern and lack of trust is thin here. If the author is not respecting her autonomy and health decisions, that's where they might be wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's friends' idea is definitely wrong, but the author isn't doing that. However, the act of continually doubting her and pushing to reintroduce the foods could be seen as not supporting her. The right approach might be to support her in getting a proper diagnosis if she's uncertain, rather than doubting her. So the author's actions might be inconsiderate, even if their intent is to help.\n"
