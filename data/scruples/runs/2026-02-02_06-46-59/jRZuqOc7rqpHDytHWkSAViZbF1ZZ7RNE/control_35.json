As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person's girlfriend has three intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar\u2014and they're doubting her because they think that's rare. They've heard stories about parents faking it, so they're skeptical. They've tried to get her to eat those things again but are now hesitating because friends suggested sneaking it into her food, which they think is crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are their skepticism, their attempts to test her reactions, and the potential breach of trust. \n\nStarting with the skepticism: having multiple intolerances can be rare, but it's not impossible. Medical conditions can develop later in life. For example, lactose intolerance can start after a certain age. So the author's doubt isn't entirely unfounded, but they might not be aware that some people do develop these issues later. However, questioning someone's health without evidence can be problematic.\n\nThen there's the part about trying to get her to eat gluten or lactose. If she's been diagnosed by a doctor, the author's pushing her to eat those things without consulting her doctor is concerning. It's possible the girl's symptoms are real, and doing this could make her feel disbelieved. That's a trust issue. Plus, if she actually does have an intolerance, forcing her to eat those foods could cause physical discomfort, which is hurtful.\n\nThe friends suggesting sneaking the food into her meals is definitely crossing a line. That's a violation of trust. The author is right to avoid that. But their current approach\u2014urging her to try\u2014is still problematic because they're not supporting her medical choices. Instead of doubting, they should be supporting her in managing her diet, even if they don't fully understand it.\n\nSo the author's main mistake is doubting her health claims without evidence and trying to test it in a way that undermines her trust. They're not respecting her experience and her choices. This can lead to conflict and hurt feelings. The right approach would be to support her, encourage her to consult a healthcare professional if there's doubt, and respect her dietary restrictions regardless of their personal opinion.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting her health decisions and are causing distrust rather than support.\n"
