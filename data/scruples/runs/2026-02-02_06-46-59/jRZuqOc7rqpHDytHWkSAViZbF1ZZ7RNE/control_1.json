As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances. First, I need to consider the medical aspect. The girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances\u2014gluten, lactose, and sugar. The user is skeptical because these are rare, citing cases where people might misdiagnose themselves, like with the mother and daughter story.\n\nSo, the user is questioning whether the girlfriend's condition is real. He's trying to get her to test her reactions by reintroducing these foods. But his friends suggest sneaking it into her food, which he refuses to do. He's concerned about trust here.\n\nNow, the key points: Is doubting a partner's health issues inherently wrong? If the user has valid medical concerns, like the rarity of multiple intolerances, maybe that's a legitimate question. However, the approach matters. Questioning and suggesting testing isn't necessarily wrong, but pushing her to try potentially harmful foods could be. Also, the fact that the girlfriend used to tolerate these foods raises questions about the validity of her current conditions.\n\nBut the user is trying to find a balance between his skepticism and respecting her health. He's not willing to cross the line of trust by sneaking things into her food, which shows he's trying to be respectful. However, his doubt might come off as dismissive of her health concerns. It's important to validate her feelings and experiences, even if there's skepticism. So, while the user's intentions might be to help, his doubt could be harmful if it undermines her trust or health. The answer hinges on whether his skepticism is justified or if he's being inconsiderate of her health without proper evidence.\n"
