As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a boyfriend of his girlfriend for 7 months. She has gluten intolerance, lactose intolerance, and sugar intolerance. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where parents might misdiagnose their kids. He's been trying to get her to eat these foods again to see if she can tolerate them, thinking it would be good for her diet. His friends suggested secretly giving her food with those ingredients, but he doesn't want to cross a trust line. He's asking if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has medical conditions, and the boyfriend is doubting their validity. It's important to note that self-diagnosis or misdiagnosis can happen, but it's also possible she's genuinely intolerant. However, the boyfriend's approach is to question her without medical consultation. Is it his place to challenge her health claims?\n\nHe mentions she used to eat these foods as a child but developed intolerances later. That's not impossible, as some people develop food intolerances over time. But the boyfriend is pushing her to test this, which could be seen as dismissive. Even if he's concerned, suggesting she re-introduce potentially harmful foods without her consent could be risky. Also, his friends' idea to secretly test her food is a red flag for trust issues.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, the boyfriend's doubts should be discussed with her and possibly a doctor, not through coercive actions. Even if she's self-diagnosed, it's her body, and pressuring her to eat things that make her feel unwell could harm the relationship. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and undermining her health choices could erode that trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's motivation is to help her eat more freely. But the method he's considering (secretly giving her the foods) crosses ethical boundaries. Open communication is better. He should express his concerns and suggest a medical check-up together, rather than trying to test her secretly or without her consent.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, doubting her could be seen as not respecting her health, but it's also possible he's motivated by wanting to help. However, his actions\u2014probing, pushing her to try the foods, and considering secret testing\u2014are problematic. The right approach would be to support her if she's already made dietary changes, or work together with a medical professional to verify the intolerances. So the answer would likely be A, he's in the wrong because his approach is disrespectful and breaches trust.\n"
