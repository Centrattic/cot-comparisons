As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. So, the situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. The author is skeptical because they've heard of people faking it, and they've been trying to get her to test those foods again. Friends suggested tricking her by giving her food with those ingredients, but the author is hesitant about that.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend has self-reported intolerances. The author is questioning their validity. The key here is the approach the author is taking. They're trying to get her to consume the foods again to test, which could be seen as undermining her health concerns. Even if the author is skeptical, pushing her to eat something she believes she can't tolerate might be harmful if she actually does have issues. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend used to eat these foods as a child and developed intolerances later. That's possible, but it's also possible she's genuinely developed them. The author's friends suggested a sneaky approach, but the author is right to think that's crossing a trust line. Trust is important in relationships, and testing without consent could damage that.\n\nBut is the skepticism itself wrong? Well, having questions about the validity isn't inherently wrong, but acting on those doubts without evidence could be. The author should probably encourage her to get medical testing instead of testing at home. If the girlfriend's symptoms are real, forcing her to eat those foods could make her feel invalidated and untrusted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation is to help her eat more freely, which is a good intention. However, the method is problematic. The right approach would be to discuss concerns with her, maybe suggest medical testing, rather than trying to test it themselves. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having doubts, but the way they're handling it might be crossing a line. However, the fact that they're considering giving her the foods without her knowledge is definitely wrong, even though they've decided against it. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions (probing, urging her to try) are wrong. If they're doing it in a respectful way, maybe not. But since they're doubting her and trying to test it without her consent, that's where the issue is. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because they're not respecting her self-reported health issues and suggesting methods that could harm trust.\n"
