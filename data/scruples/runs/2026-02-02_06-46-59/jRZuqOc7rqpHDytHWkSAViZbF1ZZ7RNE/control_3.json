As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting their girlfriend's reported food intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical and has been trying to get her to test these again. The author's motivation is to help her eat more freely, which seems caring but could be intrusive.\n\nNow, the key points are the author's actions. They're probing, suggesting she try the foods again, and friends even suggest sneaking it into her food. The author is conflicted about crossing a trust line. The author's doubt might stem from legitimate concerns, maybe thinking the girlfriend is avoiding something unnecessary, but could this be overstepping?\n\nMedical conditions like intolerances can be real, even if they develop later. The author's approach is to test without her consent (as per the friends' suggestion) which is definitely a problem. Even if the author's intention is to help, pressuring someone or secretly giving them the foods they avoid is a breach of trust and autonomy.\n\nAdditionally, the author's skepticism might be dismissive of her health concerns. Even if the author is right, the method of confronting it is important. Trust is crucial in relationships, and undermining her health choices without collaboration could harm that. The author should have discussed concerns openly instead of trying to test or manipulate.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions risk trust and autonomy, and the approach is disrespectful of her health choices.\n"
