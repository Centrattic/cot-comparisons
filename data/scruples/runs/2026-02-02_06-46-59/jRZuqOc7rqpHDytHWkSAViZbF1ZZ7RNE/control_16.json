As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. He's been skeptical because he's heard stories about parents making their kids think they have intolerances when they don't. He's tried to get her to test these things again, maybe to see if she can eat them now. His friends suggested sneaking food with those ingredients to observe her reaction, but he's against that because he values trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of his doubts. Multiple intolerances might be rare, but they're not unheard of. Some people do develop intolerances later in life. So questioning them isn't necessarily wrong, but the approach matters. He's been \"probing,\" which could mean he's pushing her to test them again. But how is he doing that? If he's being respectful and suggesting medical testing, that's different from doubting her experience. However, if he's dismissing her symptoms or not taking her at her word, that's problematic.\n\nThen there's the part about his friends suggesting giving her food with those ingredients without her consent. That's definitely crossing a trust boundary. The author rightly sees that as a line not to cross. But his own actions\u2014urging her to try gluten or lactose again\u2014might be seen as challenging her self-reported experiences. If she's been experiencing negative symptoms when consuming them, he's in a position where he needs to respect her choices unless there's evidence to the contrary. \n\nThe key here is trust and support. In a relationship, partners should support each other's health decisions. Doubting her without evidence or being dismissive could be seen as undermining her. However, if he's concerned about potential misdiagnosis or if she's open to re-evaluation by a healthcare professional, then expressing that concern isn't wrong. The problem would be if he's not respecting her autonomy or if his probing is causing her distress. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether his skepticism is expressed in a harmful way. Since he's trying to get her to test it again, maybe he's not outright saying she's lying, but his doubt could be causing tension. Also, the fact that she's had these since childhood might not be relevant; people can develop intolerances later. His friends' suggestion to secretly test her is unethical, but the author isn't doing that. However, his actions might still be inconsiderate. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong (A) because he's doubting her without providing support and possibly undermining her health concerns. Even if he's skeptical, the correct approach would be to support her decisions and perhaps encourage a professional evaluation rather than personally challenging her. Relationships require trust, and his doubt might be eroding that.\n"
