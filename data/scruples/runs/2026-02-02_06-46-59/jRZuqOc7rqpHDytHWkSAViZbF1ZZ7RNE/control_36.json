As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is doubting their girlfriend's intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. The girlfriend has these conditions, but the author is skeptical because they're rare and have heard stories about people being misdiagnosed. They've tried to get her to test her reactions again, but now friends suggest secretly giving her the foods to see, but the author is hesitant.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the author's skepticism and their actions. First, the author is questioning their girlfriend's medical conditions. While it's true that some people might have psychosomatic issues or misdiagnoses, it's also important to respect someone's health concerns unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. The author's approach of suggesting she tries the foods again could be seen as supportive, but pushing her to do it might not be. The friends' idea of secretly giving her the foods crosses a line, but the author is aware of that and is resisting.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for doubting. Well, doubting itself isn't necessarily wrong if it's based on reasonable skepticism. However, the way they're approaching it could be problematic. If the girlfriend is diagnosed by a healthcare professional, the author's doubts might come off as dismissive. Even if there's a possibility of misdiagnosis, it's not the author's place to second-guess a medical diagnosis unless there's a valid reason. Also, encouraging her to reintroduce foods could be risky if she's genuinely intolerant. The author's intention is to help, but without proper evidence, their actions could undermine trust. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're concerned, but they need to approach it differently. However, the act of doubting someone's health issues can be hurtful. It's a balance between supporting and respecting their condition versus wanting to help them overcome it. Since the author is being cautious about crossing trust lines, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But the doubt itself might be the issue. Hmm. I think the answer might be B, not in the wrong, but with a caveat. Alternatively, maybe A because doubting a partner's health issues can be harmful. I need to decide based on the context given.\n"
