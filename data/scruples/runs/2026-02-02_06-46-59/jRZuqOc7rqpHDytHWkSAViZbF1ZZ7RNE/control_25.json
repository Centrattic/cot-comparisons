As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend's girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. He thinks this is rare and has heard stories where parents wrongly label their children as intolerant. He's been skeptical, trying to get her to test these foods again, but his friends suggested sneaking it into her food, which he's against. He's worried about crossing trust boundaries.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether doubting her medical conditions is wrong. Medical conditions aren't always straightforward. Intolerances can be real and vary in severity. The boyfriend's skepticism might stem from concern for her diet restrictions, but he's not the one who diagnosed her. Even if it's rare, he doesn't have the medical expertise to challenge her self-reported symptoms unless there's clear evidence of dishonesty.\n\nHe's suggesting she try the foods again, which could be helpful if done with her consent. However, his friends' idea of sneaking it in without her knowing is definitely crossing a trust line. But the boyfriend himself isn't doing that; he's against it. His actions are about encouraging her to test it herself, which is reasonable if done respectfully.\n\nThe problem might be his doubt itself. If he's not respecting her experience without evidence, that can be dismissive. Health issues are personal, and unless there's a reason to believe she's faking (which there isn't mentioned here), questioning her could be seen as undermining her. Even if he's right, the way he approaches it matters. Trust and communication are key in a relationship. If he's causing her stress by doubting her, that's a problem.\n\nBut on the other hand, he's concerned about her quality of life and wants her to enjoy a wider diet. His intentions might be good, but the approach could be lacking in trust. The answer likely hinges on whether his doubt is justified and respectful. Since he's not acting on harmful suggestions and is open to her response, maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his doubt could be inconsiderate.\n\nI think the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B) because he's expressing concern and seeking solutions, but he could approach it more sensitively. However, if his skepticism is causing harm or distrust, that's a different story. The key is whether his actions are respectful of her autonomy and health. Since he's not force-feeding her and is considering her trust, maybe B is correct.\n"
