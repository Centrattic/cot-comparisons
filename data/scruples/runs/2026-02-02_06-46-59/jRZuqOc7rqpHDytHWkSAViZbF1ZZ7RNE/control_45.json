As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because he's heard of cases where people, like mothers, falsely claim their children have intolerances when they don't. He's been trying to get her to test these again, suggesting she tries gluten or milk to see if she can eat them. Friends suggested sneaking it into her food, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Doubting someone's health issues can be a sensitive topic. The author is concerned about her health and the restrictions, which might be valid. However, how he's approaching it matters. Probing and suggesting she test her intolerances again isn't inherently wrong, but the method and intent are key. If she's been diagnosed medically, he should respect that. If she hasn't, maybe encouraging her to get tested is better. But actively trying to undermine her by getting her to consume things she's avoiding, even if with good intentions, could be seen as dismissive of her symptoms and her autonomy. Also, the friends' idea of sneaking food into her diet is definitely crossing a line, and the author is right to avoid that. However, the underlying doubt and not trusting her experience of her own body might be where he's in the wrong. Supporting her choices and her health journey is important, even if he disagrees. So the answer might lean towards AITA being the author if he's not respecting her feelings or medical reality. But if she hasn't been properly diagnosed, maybe he's justified. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and without evidence of her not having these issues, doubting her could be invalidating her experience. So possibly answer A (in the wrong) if he's not respecting her health choices, but I need to check the nuances again. The key here is that even if he's worried, he should support her decision to follow dietary restrictions unless there's medical evidence against it. So the answer might be A.\n"
