As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's been skeptical and wants her to try those foods again, even considering secretly giving her gluten or lactose to test. Friends suggested that, but he's hesitant about crossing trust lines.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is justified in his doubts. Rare conditions can exist, but it's possible she genuinely has these intolerances. The author's approach is problematic. Probing and urging her to eat these foods could be seen as dismissive of her health. Even if he's concerned, the way he's handling it might be inconsiderate. \n\nThe key points are trust and respect. The author is in a relationship, so he should trust his partner's experience with her body. Suggesting or secretly giving her foods could violate that trust. If she's been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then the author's doubts might not be valid. It's possible she developed these intolerances over time, which isn't unheard of. \n\nAlso, the author's friends' suggestion to secretly test her is a breach of trust. The fact that he's considering this shows he's crossing a line. Even if his intentions are good (wanting her to eat more freely), the method is disrespectful. The right approach would be to support her, maybe encourage her to get a second medical opinion if he's concerned, but not to push her to eat things she's avoiding. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions are undermining his partner's health and trust. He should respect her experiences and seek to understand rather than challenge her without valid reasons.\n"
