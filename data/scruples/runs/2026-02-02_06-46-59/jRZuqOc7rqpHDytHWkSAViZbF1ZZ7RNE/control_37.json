As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which is rare. The author is skeptical and wants her to test these by reintroducing the foods, but the girlfriend says she used to eat them as a child and developed the intolerances later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author is questioning the validity of the girlfriend's health issues. On one hand, it's natural to be concerned about a partner's health and want to support them, but on the other hand, questioning their symptoms might be seen as dismissive.\n\nThe author mentions friends suggesting to secretly test her with gluten or lactose, but he refuses, which is good because that's a breach of trust. However, his skepticism might still be causing stress. The girlfriend's symptoms could be real, even if they developed later in life. Conditions can develop at any age, so it's not impossible. The author's doubt might lead to invalidation of her experience, which is harmful.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author's skepticism is based on the rarity of multiple intolerances. 2) The girlfriend's symptoms might be real, and questioning them could undermine her trust and health. 3) The author wants to help by encouraging testing, but the approach could be disrespectful if not done sensitively.\n\nIn relationships, trust and support are crucial. Dismissing a partner's health concerns can damage the relationship. The author should probably approach this with more empathy, maybe suggest professional testing (like seeing a doctor) rather than doubting her claims. So, is he in the wrong? If he's not being supportive and is making her feel doubted, then yes. But if he's genuinely concerned and wants to ensure her health, maybe he's trying to help. However, the way he's approaching it by being skeptical and suggesting secret testing (even if he doesn't do it) might be wrong. So the answer might be A.\n"
