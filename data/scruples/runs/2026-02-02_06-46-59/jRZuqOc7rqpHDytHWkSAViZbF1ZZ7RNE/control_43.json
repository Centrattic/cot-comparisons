As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has three specific intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author mentions that this is incredibly rare, which makes him skeptical. He's heard about cases where parents might misdiagnose their children, so he's concerned about her condition. He's prodding her to try these foods again and even considered sneaking them into her food to test her reactions. However, he's conflicted about crossing the trust line in their relationship.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is concerned about his girlfriend's health and the restrictions these intolerances impose. He might think she's unnecessarily limiting her diet. On the other hand, questioning her health conditions could undermine her trust and feelings. If she genuinely has these intolerances, consuming them could cause physical discomfort, which could be harmful. Also, the author's approach of suggesting she try these foods without medical advice might not be safe.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's skepticism based on statistical rarity. 2) His methods of encouraging her to test her tolerances. 3) The potential breach of trust if he were to secretly test her reactions.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The author's friends suggested sneaking food, which he rightly dismisses as crossing a line. However, his open encouragement to try the foods might still be problematic if it pressures her to ignore her health. Even if his intentions are good, doubting her health issues without evidence can be hurtful. It's possible she has legitimate reasons for her intolerances, perhaps diagnosed by a professional, so the author's doubt could be unwarranted.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author should discuss his concerns openly with her, ensuring they both understand each other's perspectives. Instead of doubting her, he should support her in managing her diet, which could improve their relationship. The fact that he's trying to encourage her to eat things she's allergic to could lead to health issues, which definitely isn't helping.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's undermining her health concerns and potentially causing harm. The answer is A.\n"
