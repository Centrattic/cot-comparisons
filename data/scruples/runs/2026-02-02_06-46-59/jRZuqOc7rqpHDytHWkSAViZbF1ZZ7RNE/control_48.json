As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about doubting their girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The user is questioning whether these are real or if she's being misdiagnosed, maybe even influenced by someone else like her mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legitimacy of multiple food intolerances. It's mentioned that having all three is rare, but rare doesn't mean impossible. Some people do have multiple sensitivities. However, the user is skeptical because they've heard stories where people are incorrectly labeled as intolerant. That's a valid concern, but how to approach it?\n\nThe user has been proactively trying to get her to test these foods again, suggesting she try gluten or lactose. The friends even suggested a more covert approach, which the user rejected, which is good because that would definitely cross trust boundaries. But is their approach appropriate?\n\nExpressing doubts can be seen as undermining her health choices. Even if the user has good intentions (wanting her to have a more varied diet), questioning her symptoms might make her feel disbelieved. Trust and respect in a relationship are important. If the girlfriend's symptoms are real to her, even if they're psychosomatic or misdiagnosed, dismissing them can cause emotional harm.\n\nAlso, the user should consider medical validation. If the girlfriend has proper medical tests or consultations confirming her intolerances, that's a different scenario. But if she's self-diagnosed or her doctor isn't thorough, the user's skepticism might be justified. However, it's not the user's place to push her to consume things she says make her ill. That could be careless.\n\nThe key points are: respecting her health decisions, not forcing her to eat something if she claims it affects her, and finding a middle ground. The user's intention to help is good, but the method might be intrusive. They should maybe encourage her to consult a healthcare professional to verify the intolerances rather than testing on their own. That way, it's a neutral third party doing the assessment, which is more respectful.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If they're pressuring her without evidence and making her feel doubted, then yes. But if they're concerned and suggesting a medical check-up, then maybe not. The line is between supportive concern and undermining her experiences. Since the user is probing and encouraging her to try the foods, which could be seen as dismissive, the answer might lean towards them being in the wrong. But it's a bit nuanced. However, the main issue is respecting her boundaries and health choices. The user's approach could be disrespectful if it's causing her anxiety or not acknowledging her symptoms.\n"
