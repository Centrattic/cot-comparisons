As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has three specific intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author mentions that these are rare, and he's skeptical because he's heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. Intolerances can develop over time, right? Like lactose intolerance can appear later in life. But having three different intolerances is unusual. However, just because something is rare doesn't mean it's impossible. The author is aware that his girlfriend used to consume these before, so the development of intolerances later could be legitimate. \n\nThe author is trying to get her to test her intolerances by eating them again. But he's conflicted because some friends suggest sneaking it into her food, which he thinks is crossing a trust boundary. He's trying to find a balance between his skepticism and respecting her medical condition.\n\nNow, the key here is whether his skepticism is justified. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a healthcare professional, then doubting that without evidence might be problematic. However, if the diagnosis is self-diagnosed or not validated, then maybe his concern is valid. But the author is approaching it in a way that could undermine her trust. Forcing her to test her intolerances without her consent could be harmful, especially if she genuinely has a condition. Even if he's right, the method of testing without her agreement is an issue.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is to help her eat more freely, which is good, but the approach might be inconsiderate. Trust in a relationship is crucial. If he's not respecting her choices without discussing it, he's definitely in the wrong. Even if his intentions are good, the way he's handling it could be manipulative. \n\nThe friends' suggestion to sneak food into her meals is definitely crossing a line. The author is right to reject that, but his probing and urging her to try the foods might still be problematic. It depends on whether he's respecting her autonomy. If he's pressuring her to eat things she's avoiding due to her reported intolerances, he's not supporting her health decisions, which can lead to conflict and mistrust.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's skepticism alone isn't wrong if he's concerned about a valid issue, but the way he's handling it\u2014without her consent and potentially undermining her health decisions\u2014is where he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
