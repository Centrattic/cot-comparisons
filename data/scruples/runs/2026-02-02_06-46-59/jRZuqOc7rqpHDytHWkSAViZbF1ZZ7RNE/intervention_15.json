As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. He finds this rare and has heard stories about people being misdiagnosed or parents influencing their children's diets. He's been skeptical and even tried to encourage her to reintroduce these foods to see if she can actually tolerate them again. Some friends suggested secretly giving her these foods, but he thinks that would cross a trust line.\n\nNow, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for doubting her. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider the possible angles. On one hand, the author is concerned about his girlfriend's health and the restrictive diet. He might think she's unnecessarily limiting herself. But on the other hand, questioning her medical conditions could be seen as dismissive or not respecting her experiences. \n\nMedical conditions like intolerances can be real and valid even if they develop later in life. The author's skepticism might stem from a place of wanting to help, but it's possible he's undermining her. Also, suggesting she try the foods again without her consent could be risky if she genuinely has an intolerance\u2014there could be adverse reactions. \n\nThe fact that she used to tolerate these foods as a child is mentioned, which can happen. Some people develop intolerances later. The author's friends' suggestion to secretly test her is definitely crossing a line, but he's against that. However, his own approach of probing and urging her to try might still be problematic. It could lead to conflict or mistrust if she feels he doesn't believe her. \n\nRespecting someone's health choices, even if you're skeptical, is important in a relationship. The line between concern and being dismissive can be thin. If the author is causing her to feel doubted, that's a red flag. Trust and communication are key here. Maybe he should be encouraging her to consult a healthcare professional instead of questioning her directly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's skepticism might not be entirely unfounded, but his actions could be seen as invalidating her experiences. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her decisions and trying to push her to reintroduce foods without her full consent. That would lean towards A. However, if the author is genuinely concerned and just wants to ensure she's not unnecessarily restricting herself, maybe there's some understanding there. But the way he's approaching it might be the issue.\n"
