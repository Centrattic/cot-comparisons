As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's been skeptical, heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their kids, and is pushing her to try these foods again. Friends suggested secretly giving her the foods, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if doubting a medical condition is wrong. Medical conditions can be real, but sometimes people self-diagnose or have psychosomatic symptoms. However, questioning a partner's health claims can be sensitive. The author is concerned about her diet restrictions and wants her to eat normally again, which is understandable. But pushing her to test her intolerances could be seen as dismissive of her feelings or health.\n\nThe key points: He's skeptical, which might not be wrong if there's a lack of evidence. However, how he's approaching it matters. Encouraging her to try the foods again is one thing, but if he's not respecting her boundaries or her self-reported symptoms, that's a problem. The fact that he's heard of cases where parents misdiagnose their kids might influence his doubt, but each situation is different. The girlfriend's experience is her reality, and dismissing that could harm trust.\n\nAlso, his friends suggested a more invasive approach, which he rightly thinks is crossing a line. So he's trying to balance his concern with respect for her autonomy. If he's doing it in a supportive way, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's causing her stress or not believing her symptoms, that's a problem. The line between concern and doubt is thin here. The answer likely depends on whether his doubt is respectful and if he's open to her perspective.\n"
