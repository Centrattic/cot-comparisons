As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author thinks that's really rare. They mention hearing stories where parents might falsely claim their kids have intolerances. The author is trying to get her to test these by eating them again, but some friends suggest sneaking food to see her reaction, which the author says is crossing a trust line. The author is conflicted but wants her to eat normally.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about medical conditions and trust in a relationship. The author's skepticism could be due to genuine concern, but they might be invalidating her experiences. It's possible she actually has these intolerances, and the author's doubt could be causing stress. Even if the author's intention is to help, questioning her symptoms without proper medical consultation is problematic. Also, suggesting she try the foods again without her consent might lead to health issues if she's truly intolerant. Sneaking food into her meals (as suggested by friends) is a breach of trust, and the author correctly sees that as a red line. But by pushing her to test it themselves, they might be undermining her trust in them. The key here is respecting her medical claims unless there's evidence to the contrary. Without a doctor's assessment or proper testing, the author's actions could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. So, the answer is A\u2014they are in the wrong for doubting her and not supporting her medical choices.\n"
