As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author doubting their girlfriend's dietary intolerances. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. The author mentions that she used to eat those things as a child and now claims to have developed these intolerances. The author has been skeptical and has tried to get her to test these by consuming them again. Friends suggested tricking her by giving her food with those ingredients to see her reaction, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's doubt about the legitimacy of the intolerances and their methods of trying to test it. The author is concerned because they think it's possible she was misdiagnosed or maybe even faking it, citing stories where parents do that to their kids. But the author isn't going as far as tricking her, which some friends suggested. Instead, they're just encouraging her to try again, which could be seen as supportive but also as doubting her condition.\n\nNow, considering medical issues, it's important to respect someone's health conditions unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. The author's approach is to question without evidence, which might not be the best way. If the girlfriend has medical documentation from a healthcare provider, then it's valid regardless of how rare it is. The author's skepticism might come from a place of wanting to help, but challenging someone's health issues can be seen as dismissive. Also, pushing someone to eat something they avoid due to a medical reason could be harmful if it's legitimate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to find a solution to help her eat more freely, which is a good intention. However, the method of doubting without evidence and suggesting she try the foods again might not be the right approach. The author should probably encourage her to consult a healthcare professional for proper testing rather than trying to test it themselves. The fact that the author is considering a trust issue is a good sign, showing they value the relationship, but the underlying doubt might still be problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend's conditions are valid, then the author's doubt is unwarranted and could be hurtful. If they're not, the author is trying to help. But without evidence, the author shouldn't assume. The right approach would be to support her in getting a proper diagnosis and not question her health claims without professional input. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for doubting her without evidence and trying to test her through their own experiments.\n"
