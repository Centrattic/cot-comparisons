As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. Let me try to work through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. The author has been skeptical, possibly influenced by stories where parents misdiagnose their children. The author is trying to get her to test these foods again, suggesting she might have developed the intolerance later. Friends even suggest sneaking it in, but the author is against that because it breaks trust.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is concerned because these restrictions are limiting her diet. Maybe they feel it's unnecessary or that she's being overly cautious. But on the other hand, the girlfriend claims to have these intolerances. Even if they are rare, it's possible she does have them. The author's approach of trying to get her to test again might be well-meaning, but if the girlfriend isn't open to that, it could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns.\n\nThe key points here are skepticism vs. belief in her own body. The author might think that because these intolerances are rare, they're not real, but that's a fallacy. Just because something is uncommon doesn't mean it's not true for someone specific. Also, the author's friends suggesting to test without her consent is a red flag. Even if the author is against that method, their own probing could still be crossing a line if it's not supportive or if it undermines her trust.\n\nThe girlfriend might be anxious or have valid reasons for her restrictions. The author's doubt could be making her feel invalidated. The story mentions she \"developed\" these conditions as an adult, which is possible. Some people do develop new intolerances later in life. The author's intention to help by encouraging her to eat these foods again could be good, but the approach might be wrong. Trust is important in a relationship, and pushing someone to consume things that make them unwell, even if it's out of concern, can erode that trust.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but doubting someone's health issues, especially when they are self-reports, can be problematic. The right approach would be to support her in seeking medical confirmation rather than testing it themselves. The author's skepticism, while perhaps based on real examples, is leading them to question her experience, which isn't fair. Unless they have concrete evidence that the intolerances are not real, they shouldn't challenge her. So, the answer is probably AITA for doubting, but the key is whether they're in the wrong. The author is being skeptical without proper evidence and maybe not respecting her boundaries. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
