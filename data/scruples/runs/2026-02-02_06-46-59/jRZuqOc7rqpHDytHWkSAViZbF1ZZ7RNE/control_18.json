As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks are rare. The author is skeptical because he's heard of cases where parents misdiagnose their kids. He's been trying to get her to eat those foods again to see if she can tolerate them, but maybe he's crossed a line. His friends suggested a test, but he's hesitant because it might break trust.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author is doubting her medical conditions, wants her to reintroduce foods, friends suggest testing, but he's worried about trust. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, if she actually has these intolerances, he's not respecting her health needs. On the other hand, he's concerned about potential fad diets or unnecessary restrictions. But pushing her to eat something she claims causes her issues could be harmful. Even if he's right, doing it without her consent might be a breach of trust. Also, the author should trust her self-reporting unless there's evidence she's lying. Without a doctor's confirmation, it's hard to decide. But intentionally giving her gluten or lactose without her knowledge is definitely crossing a line. So, the answer might be that he's in the wrong for planning to test her without her agreement.\n"
