As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that his girlfriend has multiple intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical and has been suggesting she try the foods again, even considering secretly giving her gluten or lactose to test her reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's skepticism might stem from genuine concern or from not wanting to restrict his partner's diet. However, the key points are about trust and consent. The author is questioning his partner's health claims, which can be seen as undermining her autonomy. Even if he's well-intentioned, pushing her to try the foods or planning to test her without consent could be a breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's health choices unless there's clear evidence of misinformation. The author isn't a medical professional, so his doubt about her conditions isn't necessarily valid. The girlfriend might feel disrespected or invalidated if her partner doesn't believe her symptoms. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions is problematic because it's deceptive and could harm their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the rarity of multiple intolerances and wants his partner to feel better. But the approach here is the issue. Instead of doubting her, he should support her in consulting a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis. The act of questioning without evidence or consent is where he's wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his partner's autonomy and is planning actions that could breach trust.\n"
