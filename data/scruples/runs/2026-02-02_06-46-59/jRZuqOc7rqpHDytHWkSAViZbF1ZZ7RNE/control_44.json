As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. She has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerance, which he says is rare. He's skeptical because he's heard stories where parents misdiagnose their kids. He's trying to get her to eat these foods again, thinking maybe she can now. Friends suggested sneaking them into her food, but he's against that because it's a trust issue.\n\nFirst, I should consider the medical aspect. Real food intolerances do exist, even if having multiple is uncommon. However, some people might self-diagnose or have psychosomatic symptoms. But that doesn't mean the user is right to doubt her. Relationships require trust. If she's told him she has these issues, he's supposed to believe her unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. Probing and suggesting she try the foods could be seen as dismissive. Also, his friends' idea of sneaking the foods is definitely crossing a line, and he's right to reject that.\n\nBut wait, the user isn't trying to harm, just to help. Maybe he's concerned about her quality of life. Still, without discussing it openly with her, he's acting on his own assumptions. Trust is key. If she's not lying, his actions could be hurtful. If she is mistaken, maybe they should talk to a doctor. The problem is, he's doubting her without evidence and suggesting she test herself, which could be dangerous if she actually has an intolerance. So he's not wrong in wanting to verify, but his approach is problematic. The answer might be A because he's not respecting her claims and could be causing stress. Alternatively, if her conditions are real, his skepticism is unwarranted. So the answer is A.\n"
