As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's been skeptical, suggesting she try these foods again, and friends even suggested secretly testing her reactions. The author is conflicted about crossing trust lines.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. While having multiple intolerances is rare, it's not impossible. People can develop food intolerances later in life due to various reasons like gut health issues, stress, or other factors. The author's skepticism might stem from genuine concern, but it's important to respect her health claims unless there's clear evidence to the contrary.\n\nSecond, the approach of secretly testing her reactions by giving her gluten or lactose without her consent is definitely crossing a trust boundary. That's a red flag. Even if his intentions are good, manipulating her without her knowledge is unethical and could damage the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about her restricted diet is valid. But instead of doubting her, he should encourage her to consult a healthcare professional for proper testing. Suggesting she try the foods again under controlled conditions with medical supervision could be a better approach than sneaking it in.\n\nThe key here is trust and respect. If the girlfriend has been diagnosed by a doctor, the author needs to respect that unless there's a reason to believe the diagnosis is incorrect. Even then, the proper way is to discuss and seek medical advice together, not to push her without her consent.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, his intentions might be good, but the method of questioning her without trust and considering sneaky tactics is problematic. He should focus on supporting her health decisions and fostering open communication rather than doubting her experiences.\n"
