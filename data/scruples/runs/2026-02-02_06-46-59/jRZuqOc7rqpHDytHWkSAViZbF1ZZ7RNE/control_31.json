As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is questioning their girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar, which are supposed to be rare. The author is skeptical because they've heard of cases where people are misdiagnosed or parents might falsely claim their children have these issues. The author has been trying to get the girlfriend to test these foods again, but they're hesitant to go as far as sneaking gluten or lactose into her food. The friends suggested that, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is doubting their partner's health conditions. Even if the conditions are rare, it's not the author's place to question the validity of someone else's medical issues. The girlfriend might have legitimate reasons for her restrictions, even if the author doesn't understand them. The author's approach of urging her to try the foods again could come from a good place (wanting her to have more freedom), but the way they're doing it\u2014by doubting and pushing for testing without her consent\u2014could be seen as dismissive and undermining her health concerns.\n\nAnother angle: the author is considering a sneaky approach, which their friends suggested. Even if they don't go through with it, the fact that they're contemplating it shows a lack of trust and respect for their partner's autonomy. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and this action would definitely breach that trust. The author's skepticism might stem from good intentions, but the method of addressing it is problematic.\n\nAlso, medical conditions can develop at any age. Just because someone had these foods as a child doesn't mean they can't develop intolerances later. The author's assumption that it's likely a misdiagnosis is not supported by evidence. It's possible the girlfriend has valid reasons for her restrictions, based on a doctor's advice or her own experiences.\n\nThe ethical aspect here is about respecting a partner's health choices. Even if there's doubt, the right approach is to support and seek understanding rather than challenge or test the validity without consent. The author's actions could lead to feelings of betrayal or mistrust in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the right because they're questioning their partner's health decisions in a way that could harm trust and show a lack of support. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
