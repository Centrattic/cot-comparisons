As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's dietary intolerances. She has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerance, which they find rare. They mention that these conditions developed later, and they\u2019ve heard stories where parents misdiagnose their kids. They\u2019re trying to get her to test them again, but some friends suggest sneaking it in, which they think is crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical side. If the girlfriend genuinely believes she has these intolerances, even if they're rare, she's likely making dietary choices based on that. The boyfriend's skepticism might come from a place of concern, but doubting her without evidence could undermine her. However, if she's misdiagnosed, maybe he's right to be concerned.\n\nBut how to verify? Suggesting she try the foods again is one thing, but forcing or sneaking it in without consent is another. The boyfriend is against the sneaky approach, which is good. He's trying to encourage her to test, which is reasonable if done respectfully. However, his doubt might make her feel invalidated. Trust is important in a relationship, so if he's constantly doubting her symptoms, that could be harmful.\n\nAlso, medical conditions aren't always straightforward. Even if it's rare, if she's been diagnosed by a professional, his doubt could be unwarranted. Unless he has evidence she's faking it, he shouldn't assume. His friends' suggestion to secretly test is bad, but he's against that, so maybe he's trying to handle it right. Still, constantly questioning her could be inconsiderate. So maybe he's partially wrong for doubting without proof, but trying to encourage testing is a good approach. But the main issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy and feelings. If he's making it about his skepticism rather than her health, that's a problem.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's doubting her without evidence, which can be hurtful and disrespectful. Even if his intentions are good, questioning her valid medical conditions without proof can damage trust and show a lack of support. Unless there's a valid reason to think she's misdiagnosed, he should respect her choices.\n"
