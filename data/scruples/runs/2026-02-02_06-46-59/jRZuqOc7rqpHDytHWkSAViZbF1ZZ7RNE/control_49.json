As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. They mention that some mothers might falsely claim their kids have intolerances, and he's been trying to get her to test them again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend claims multiple intolerances. The author is skeptical because it's rare to have all three, and he's heard of cases where parents might misdiagnose. He's trying to get her to test her tolerance again. But he's also considering sneaking gluten into her food, which his friends suggested, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for doubting her. On one hand, he's concerned about her health and wants her to enjoy food without restrictions. On the other, questioning her health issues could be seen as dismissive. It's a balance between supporting her and being skeptical. \n\nThe key points here: Is it right to challenge her self-reported intolerances? If she's been diagnosed by a doctor, then doubting that might not be helpful. But if the diagnoses are not verified, maybe there's room for doubt. However, even if the diagnoses are questionable, the author should approach it with care. Pressuring her to test without her consent could be harmful. The fact that he's considering sneaking gluten into her food is problematic because it's a betrayal of trust. \n\nAlso, the author's friends suggested that approach, but he himself thinks it's crossing a line. So he's aware it's a bad idea but is still considering it. His actions, even if well-meaning, could undermine her trust. The skepticism itself isn't necessarily wrong if he's doing it in a respectful way, but the methods he's contemplating (like sneaking food) are definitely wrong. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If he pushes her to consume something she believes she's intolerant to, especially without her knowledge, it can lead to serious health issues if she actually is intolerant. Even if she's not, causing stress or health problems for her is not acceptable. The author needs to respect her choices unless there's clear evidence she's misdiagnosed, and he should communicate his concerns openly instead of testing her without consent.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because he's planning to test her without her consent, which breaches trust and could be harmful. However, his initial skepticism might stem from a place of wanting the best for her, but the way he's approaching it is problematic.\n"
