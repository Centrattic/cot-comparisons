As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances. The situation involves gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerance, which the writer considers rare. He's skeptical because he's heard of cases where people, like mothers, might falsely claim intolerances. He's tried to get her to test these by eating them again, and some friends suggested secretly giving her gluten or lactose to see her reaction, but he feels that crosses a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The girlfriend has self-reported these intolerances, and the boyfriend's skepticism might be based on his knowledge of such cases. However, even if it's rare, it's possible she genuinely has these issues. His approach of encouraging her to test them again could be seen as supportive if done respectfully, but pushing her might be seen as dismissive of her health concerns. The friends' suggestion of secretly giving her the foods is definitely unethical and could damage trust, but the author isn't doing that.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The boyfriend is expressing doubt about the validity of her intolerances. 2) He's trying to encourage her to test them, which isn't the same as forcing her. 3) He's against the idea of secretly testing, which is a good point. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, doubting someone's health conditions can be problematic because it's their body and experience. Even if there's a possibility she's mistaken or exaggerating, the boyfriend's approach should be supportive. However, he's not outright dismissing her but is questioning the validity based on his knowledge. The issue is whether his skepticism is justified or if it's undermining her health concerns. \n\nSince he's not acting in a harmful way (like secretly testing) and is instead encouraging her to test in a non-coercive manner, maybe he's not in the wrong. But on the other hand, he's not respecting her medical experience. However, the fact that he's considering her well-being by wanting her to eat normally suggests he's coming from a place of care. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to find a solution and isn't crossing ethical lines like the friends suggested. But some might argue that doubting without evidence is wrong. It's a bit of a balance between skepticism and respect for her autonomy.\n"
