As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is in a 7-month relationship with their girlfriend, who claims to have multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The user is skeptical because they find it rare and have heard stories about people being falsely told they have intolerances. They've been trying to get her to test these by eating the foods again. Some friends suggest secretly giving her these foods to see her reaction, but the user is hesitant about crossing a trust line.\n\nThe user is asking if they're at fault for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances and trying to get her to test them. The person answering thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girlfriend has three intolerances, which the user finds rare. They're skeptical because of stories where parents might misdiagnose their kids. The user is trying to encourage her to reintroduce these foods. Friends suggest a more sneaky approach, which the user avoids. The user is concerned about trust.\n\nNow, considering the user's actions: questioning the girlfriend's health claims. Is that wrong? Well, health issues can be real, but sometimes people might misdiagnose themselves. The user's motivation is to help her eat normally again. But how to approach this?\n\nThe user is being skeptical, but maybe that's not inherently wrong. However, the method of trying to get her to test by secretly giving her the foods (as suggested by friends) is crossing a trust line. The user realizes that and chooses not to do it, which is good. But publicly doubting her and pushing her to try these foods could be seen as undermining her health concerns.\n\nIf the girlfriend's symptoms are real, then the user's skepticism could cause her distress. On the other hand, if the intolerances aren't real, the user might be enabling a restrictive diet unnecessarily. But how to verify?\n\nThe user should probably encourage her to get tested by a medical professional instead of testing it themselves. Self-diagnosis is common, but without medical confirmation, it's hard to say. However, the user's approach of trying to provoke symptoms by having her eat the foods without consulting a doctor might not be the best way. It could lead to arguments, stress, and possibly harm the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are key. Questioning a partner's health in a public forum (like the AITA subreddit) and pushing her to test her symptoms without her consent could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. The user might have valid concerns, but the way they're handling it is problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user is in the wrong because they're doubting their girlfriend's health claims and suggesting methods that could harm their trust. They should instead support her in seeking medical advice rather than testing it themselves.\n"
