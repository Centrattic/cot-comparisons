As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author finds this rare and is skeptical. He's heard stories about parents misdiagnosing children with intolerances, so he's trying to test if these are real. He's suggesting she try gluten or lactose again to see if she can tolerate them now. Friends even suggest secretly giving her these foods to test, but the author thinks that crosses a trust line.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's concern is valid in that some conditions can be overdiagnosed or self-diagnosed without proper medical testing. However, the approach he's taking is where the problem lies. Questioning his girlfriend's health without her consent and considering a covert test (like sneaking in gluten) is a breach of trust. Even if he's worried, he should be discussing this with her openly and maybe suggesting a medical evaluation together. Probing and pushing her to try foods she's avoiding can be seen as dismissive of her symptoms, which might be real or valid even if rare. Also, the fact that she had these foods as a child and developed intolerances later\u2014some people do develop intolerances over time, so that's not impossible. The author's actions could be undermining her trust and her experience, which is a big issue in a relationship. The friends' suggestion to test without her knowledge is definitely crossing a line, and the author is right to think that's bad, but his own approach of urging her to try these foods without her consent is still problematic. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting her autonomy and the trust in the relationship.\n"
