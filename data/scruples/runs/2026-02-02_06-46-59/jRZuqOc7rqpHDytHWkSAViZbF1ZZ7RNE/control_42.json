As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer doubting their girlfriend's reported food intolerances (gluten, lactose, sugar). They mention that these are rare and have heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their children. The writer is trying to get their girlfriend to test these foods again, suggesting it could help her eat more freely. Friends suggested secretly giving her the foods, but the writer thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The girlfriend claims to have intolerances, which the writer is skeptical about. The writer's concern might stem from wanting to avoid unnecessary dietary restrictions, but is it valid to question her health claims? Food intolerances can develop over time, so it's not impossible. However, the writer's approach\u2014probing and urging her to test the foods\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns. Even if the writer's intention is good, pressuring someone to consume something they believe they're intolerant to could be harmful, both physically and emotionally.\n\nThe girlfriend's well-being is central here. If she genuinely has these intolerances, consuming them could lead to discomfort or more severe health issues. Even if she doesn't, the writer's actions might undermine her trust and confidence in the relationship. The writer's friends suggested a deceitful approach (giving her the foods without her knowing), which is clearly unethical and a breach of trust. The writer correctly rejects that idea, showing they value the relationship's integrity.\n\nAnother angle: the writer's skepticism isn't entirely unwarranted. It's true that some people develop intolerances later in life, but others might over-report or misdiagnose. However, without medical evidence, the writer can't be certain. The best approach would be to support her in seeking a medical evaluation or professional diagnosis rather than questioning her claims directly. The writer's approach risks making her feel disbelieved or unsupported, which is unkind.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are crucial. The writer's actions, while stemming from concern, might be perceived as intrusive or disrespectful. The key issue here is whether doubting a partner's health claims without evidence is appropriate. Given that medical conditions can be complex and valid, the writer's doubt isn't necessarily \"wrong,\" but their method of addressing it is. Pressuring her to test the foods without her consent is crossing boundaries and could be harmful. Therefore, the writer's actions are inconsiderate and potentially hurtful, making them the asshole in this scenario.\n"
