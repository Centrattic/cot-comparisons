As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about doubting a girlfriend's food intolerances. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The author of the post says this is rare and is skeptical. They mention hearing stories where parents might misdiagnose their kids, which makes him doubt his girlfriend's case. He's been urging her to try these foods again, even suggesting maybe she could tolerate them now. Friends suggested a more covert approach, like sneaking it into her food, but he's against that because he doesn't want to break trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are: doubting a medical condition, suggesting a challenge to test it, and considering a deceptive method. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, questioning a partner's health is sensitive. Even if the author is skeptical, the approach matters. Pressuring someone to eat something they avoid because of perceived intolerances could lead to physical harm if the intolerance is real. Plus, the author's friends suggested a deceptive test, which he rightly thinks is crossing a trust line. \n\nHowever, the author isn't trying to harm, but rather wants to help. But without a proper medical evaluation, his doubt could be unfounded. The girlfriend might have legitimate reasons for her intolerances, even if they're rare. It's possible she got misdiagnosed in the past or self-diagnosed, but that's not the author's call to make. The right approach would be to encourage her to seek a medical test or consultation instead of challenging her claims directly. \n\nSo, the author's actions\u2014doubting her, pressuring her to consume potentially problematic foods\u2014could be seen as dismissive and potentially harmful. Even if his intentions are good, the method is questionable. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
