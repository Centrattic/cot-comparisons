As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the GF has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerance, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical, having heard stories of parents faking intolerances. He's trying to get her to try gluten or lactose again, but friends suggest giving her the food without telling her, which he thinks is crossing a line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical validity. Gluten intolerance can be celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Lactose intolerance is common, but developing it later is possible. Sugar intolerance might be fructose malabsorption. But having all three is rare. The author's skepticism is based on the rarity and the idea that she developed them later, which could be legitimate concerns. However, dismissing her symptoms outright without evidence could be harmful.\n\nThe author is trying to help by encouraging her to test, but the friends' suggestion to secretly give her the foods is problematic. The author is right to avoid that. However, his public skepticism and probing might undermine her trust. It's important to respect her health choices unless there's clear evidence of fabrication. Medical conditions shouldn't be doubted without reason. The author's approach should be supportive, maybe suggesting consulting a doctor instead of doubting her. So, the answer is A because he's in the wrong for doubting without evidence and not respecting her health choices, even if his intentions are to help.\n"
