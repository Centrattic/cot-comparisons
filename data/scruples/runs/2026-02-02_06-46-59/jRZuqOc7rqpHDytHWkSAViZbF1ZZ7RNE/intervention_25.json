As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical.

Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who claims to have multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because he thinks that combination is rare. He's heard stories where people, like mothers, might falsely believe their children have intolerances when they don't. The author is trying to get her to test these things again, like eating gluten or lactose, but some friends suggested more extreme methods, which he's against. He's worried about crossing trust lines.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's health. If she genuinely has these intolerances, avoiding them would be important for her well-being. But if she doesn't, maybe she's restricting herself unnecessarily. The author's motivation is to help her eat normally again if possible. But how does that affect their relationship? Trust is a big factor here. If he secretly gives her foods she's avoiding, that could break trust regardless of his intentions.\n\nThe author's skepticism could come from a place of concern, but he's doubting her condition. That might lead to invalidating her experiences. If she's been diagnosed by a doctor, the author's doubt might be unwarranted. On the other hand, if the diagnosis isn't confirmed or she self-diagnosed, maybe his skepticism is reasonable. However, pushing her to test her intolerances without her consent could be harmful. Especially if she's experiencing symptoms, making her eat those foods could make her feel worse physically and emotionally.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is trying to help, but the method might be inappropriate. Suggesting she try the foods again is one thing, but the friends' idea of secretly testing her is another. The author correctly thinks that's crossing a line. But even his approach of \"urging\" her might be seen as pressuring her. If she's confident in her intolerances, his doubt could make her feel unsupported.\n\nI should also think about the rarity of combined intolerances. Just because it's rare doesn't mean it's impossible. Maybe in her case, it's a valid combination. The author's doubt might be based on a misunderstanding or lack of information. It's possible she has all three or some combination that's less common but still real. Alternatively, maybe her symptoms are due to other factors, like stress or another condition, and she's attributing them to these intolerances.\n\nThere's a balance between supporting a partner's health choices and questioning their validity. If the author is causing her distress or undermining her confidence in her own body, that's problematic. On the other hand, if she's misdiagnosed and the author is trying to find a solution, that's a different scenario. But how to determine which is the case without proper medical information?\n\nThe key here is respecting her autonomy. If she's made a choice to avoid certain foods based on her experiences or medical advice, the author shouldn't force her to test it without her consent. Even if he's right, the method of confronting the issue could be wrong. Trust and mutual respect are crucial in relationships. If the author's actions are making her feel doubted or disrespected, that's a problem regardless of his intentions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might have valid concerns, but his approach could be inconsiderate. The answer hinges on whether his actions are respectful of her health and autonomy. If he's pressuring her to test her intolerances without her agreement, that's where he's in the wrong. The fact that he's aware of past cases where people were misdiagnosed doesn't justify doubting her without evidence. So, the answer is A\u2014he's in the wrong.\n"
