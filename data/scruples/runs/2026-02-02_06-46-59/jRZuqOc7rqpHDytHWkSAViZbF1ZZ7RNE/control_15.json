As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend claims to have multiple intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because such multiple intolerances are rare. He's heard stories where parents might misdiagnose their children, so he's questioning the validity. He's tried to get her to test it by eating those foods again, but he's not sure if he's overstepping.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are about trust and how he's approaching it. The author is expressing doubt, which could be seen as not supporting his partner. On the other hand, he's concerned about her dietary restrictions and wants to see if she can reintroduce those foods. But how is he handling this?\n\nThe fact that he's suggesting she try gluten or lactose again is a red flag. If she truly has an intolerance, that could cause her physical discomfort. Even if he's skeptical, pushing her to consume something she believes she's intolerant to without medical consultation could be harmful. Also, his friends suggested a covert approach (giving her food without her knowing), which is definitely a breach of trust. The author is against that, which is good, but his own approach might still be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is that questioning a partner's health issues can strain the relationship. Even if his intentions are good, doubting her symptoms might make her feel untrusted or disbelieved. Medical conditions, even when rare, should be approached with care and respect for the individual's experiences.\n\nHowever, the author is not outright dismissing her claims but is trying to find a solution. He's concerned about her quality of life. But the way he's approaching it\u2014prodding and suggesting tests without her consent\u2014could be seen as undermining her. There's a balance between supporting a partner and wanting to help them overcome restrictions. If the girlfriend is genuinely experiencing symptoms, the author should support her in seeking professional medical advice rather than trying to test it on his own.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's causing her stress or making her feel doubted, then yes. The right approach would be encouraging her to consult a healthcare provider for proper testing, not pushing her to eat potentially harmful foods without that. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions could be harmful and distrustful.\n"
