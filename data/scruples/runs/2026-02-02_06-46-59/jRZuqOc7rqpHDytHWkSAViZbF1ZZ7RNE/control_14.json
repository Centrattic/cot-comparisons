As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer doubting their girlfriend's reported food intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances. The writer is skeptical because these are rare together. They mention stories where parents might misdiagnose their children. The writer has tried to get her to eat gluten or lactose again, which she used to tolerate as a child. Friends suggest secretly giving her those foods, but the writer is hesitant to break trust.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle here. The key points are: the writer is doubting a medical condition, suggesting she might not have it, and considering testing without her consent. Even though the writer is concerned about her restrictive diet, questioning someone's health issues without their consent can be seen as crossing a line. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and pushing someone to consume foods they believe they can't tolerate, especially without their knowledge, could harm that trust. The writer's intention is good (wants her to eat more normally), but the method might be problematic. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions is definitely a breach of trust, and the writer is right to hesitate there. However, openly encouraging her to try those foods might still be risky if she genuinely believes she's intolerant. It's possible she has developed these intolerances over time, which isn't unheard of, especially with conditions like celiac where symptoms can develop later. So, the writer's doubt might be unfounded. But the main issue is not the doubt itself\u2014people can question things\u2014but the approach. Pressuring her to eat things she avoids because of her beliefs could lead to health issues if she truly is intolerant. The line is between concern and respect for her health choices. If she's been diagnosed by a medical professional, the writer should respect that unless there's evidence it's a false diagnosis. Since the scenario doesn't mention any such evidence, the writer's actions might be undermining her health decisions. Therefore, the answer likely is that the writer is in the wrong (A), because they are not respecting her medical choices and are considering sneaky testing, which is a breach of trust.\n"
