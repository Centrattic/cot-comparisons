As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. The situation involves the girlfriend having three specific intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because these are rare and mentions stories where people are misdiagnosed, possibly due to parents influencing the belief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Doubting a partner's health issues can be sensitive. The author is trying to encourage her to test these intolerances again, perhaps to reverse the restrictions. But there's a line between concern and overstepping. The girlfriend's health is a personal matter, and the author's approach might undermine her trust.\n\nThe author mentions friends suggesting sneaking food with those ingredients, which he rightly thinks is crossing a trust line. That's a good point. However, his questioning and urging her to test again might still be problematic. Even if his intentions are good (wanting her to have a less restricted diet), questioning her symptoms without her consent could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns.\n\nMedical conditions are personal, and even if the author is skeptical, the right approach would involve supporting her, perhaps suggesting medical consultation rather than testing without her agreement. The fact that she has these conditions is what she's experiencing, and as a partner, respecting her experience is crucial unless there's clear evidence to the contrary.\n\nAlso, the rarity of the combined intolerances is mentioned. While that's a fact, it's possible for someone to develop multiple intolerances over time. The author's skepticism might stem from not understanding the medical possibilities. However, that's not a justification for undermining her experience. The key issue here is the author's actions\u2014questioning her symptoms and suggesting unapproved tests, which can erode trust and show a lack of support.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect for each other's health issues are important. Even if the author has doubts, the appropriate way to address them would be through open dialogue, maybe involving healthcare professionals, rather than trying to challenge her symptoms directly. Therefore, the author's actions, though possibly well-meaning, are inconsiderate of her feelings and autonomy regarding her health.\n"
