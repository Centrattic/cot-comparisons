As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's intolerances. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds incredibly rare. He's skeptical and has heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their kids. He's trying to get her to test these foods again, even though she developed the intolerances later in life. Friends suggested sneaking food with these items to see her reaction, but he doesn't want to cross a trust line.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, questioning a partner's health issues can be seen as dismissive. Intolerances are real, even if they develop later. The author's approach of suggesting she try the foods again might be well-meaning, but it's important to respect her autonomy and feelings. Pressuring someone to consume something they avoid due to health concerns could be harmful, even if the intent is to help.\n\nOn the other hand, he's concerned about the rarity of multiple intolerances and wants to support her by possibly expanding her diet. But his method involves doubt, which can be hurtful. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and undermining her health issues could damage that trust.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Is doubting her condition justified? 2) Is pressuring her to test it appropriate? 3) Are his friends' suggestions (sneaking food) a red flag?\n\nThe author doesn't want to cross the trust line, which is good, but his skepticism itself might be problematic. He should approach this with empathy, perhaps suggesting medical testing rather than doubting her experiences. The fact that he's trying to urge her to eat these foods without her consent could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's health is important. Even if his intentions are good, the way he's approaching it could be hurtful. The answer likely leans towards him being in the wrong (A) because doubting a partner's legitimate health concerns can be damaging, even if the concerns might be valid or not. It's about respecting her experience and seeking appropriate medical advice rather than personal experimentation.\n"
