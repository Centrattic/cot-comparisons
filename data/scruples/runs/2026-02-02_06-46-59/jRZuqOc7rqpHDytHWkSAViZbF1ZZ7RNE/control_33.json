Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a guy in a 7-month relationship with his girlfriend. She has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which he thinks are incredibly rare. He's been skeptical because he's heard stories where parents might falsely label their kids as intolerant. He's trying to get her to test these again, like eating gluten or lactose to see if she can actually tolerate them now. He wants her to be able to eat these things again because her diet is restricted. His friends suggested sneaking gluten/lactose into her food to test her reactions, but he refuses to do that because it crosses a trust line. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. First, the key points here are his skepticism versus respecting her health claims. He's doubting her medical conditions, which could be valid if she's actually faking or if there's a misunderstanding. But how to approach this without being harmful?\n\nHe mentions that his girlfriend used to have gluten and lactose as a child but somehow developed intolerances. Intolerances can develop later in life, though they are less common than allergies. However, they do exist. If she was diagnosed medically, then that's a different story. But if she's self-diagnosed or if there's no proper testing, then his skepticism might be warranted. However, even if there's no medical proof, if she believes she can't eat these things and it's causing her distress or avoiding certain foods, his doubting her could be hurtful.\n\nHe wants her to try these foods again. But if she's convinced she's intolerant, forcing her to eat them could cause physical discomfort or emotional pain. His friends' idea to sneak it into her food is definitely crossing a line, which he correctly recognizes. But his own approach of \"urging\" her is still questionable. It's one thing to encourage her to get tested or to seek a medical opinion, but pressuring her to reintroduce foods without her consent could be seen as dismissive of her health concerns.\n\nMedical conditions, even if self-diagnosed, should be taken seriously unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. If he's not sure, the right approach would be to support her in getting a proper diagnosis. If she's been tested and it's confirmed, then his doubt is unfounded. If there's no testing, maybe he should suggest that together they look into it medically. But directly urging her to eat the foods or doubting her symptoms can damage trust and show a lack of support.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the relationship being only 7 months, trust is crucial. Doubting her health in this way could be perceived as not respecting her autonomy and her body. Even if he has good intentions, his actions might be seen as controlling or dismissive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's doubting her health claims without proper medical evidence and is pressuring her to reintroduce foods that she believes cause her issues. He's not approaching it with an open mind and is not respecting her experience, which is more important than his skepticism. The correct answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
