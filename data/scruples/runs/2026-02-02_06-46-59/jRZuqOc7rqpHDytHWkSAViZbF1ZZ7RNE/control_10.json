As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's doubting his girlfriend's intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. He mentions that it's rare to have all three and that he's heard of cases where parents might fabricate such conditions. He's been trying to get her to test these again, maybe even secretly, but he's conflicted about crossing trust lines.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Doubting a partner's health conditions can be seen as dismissive. Medical conditions are personal and can be sensitive. Even if he has concerns, how he's handling them matters. Probing and pushing her to reintroduce these foods without her consent could be harmful. If she's been diagnosed by a doctor, his skepticism might not be justified unless there's clear evidence. However, if she's self-diagnosed or if there's a history of fabricated issues, his concerns might have some merit. But suggesting friends want to test her without her knowledge is definitely a breach of trust. Trust is crucial in relationships. Even if his intentions are good (wanting her to have a better diet), the method of questioning her without proper approach could be seen as disrespectful. He should have discussed this openly with her first instead of trying to test her. So, the answer might lean towards AITA A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her medical choices and possibly violating her trust.\n"
