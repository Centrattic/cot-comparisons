As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical, mentions stories about parents faking intolerances, and has been trying to get her to eat those things again. Friends suggested giving her hidden gluten or lactose, but the author thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is questioning the validity of the girlfriend's medical conditions. While it's true that some people might develop intolerances later in life, the author's approach could be seen as dismissive. The girlfriend has her own beliefs about her health, and the author is pushing her to test it, which might not be respectful of her experiences.\n\nThe key points here are trust and respect in a relationship. The author is trying to help by suggesting she try the foods again, but without her consent. Even if the author's intentions are good, doing this without the girlfriend's agreement could be seen as a breach of trust. The author mentions that they think giving her food with gluten or lactose without her knowing is crossing a line, which shows some awareness of the issue.\n\nHowever, the author is still in a position where they are doubting the girlfriend's self-reported health issues. It's important to validate a partner's health concerns unless there's clear evidence to the contrary. The author might not have discussed this openly with the girlfriend, which is a problem. Open communication is key in relationships, and the author's actions could be seen as undermining the girlfriend's autonomy over her health.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author has legitimate concerns about the girlfriend's health\u2014like maybe she's being misdiagnosed or unnecessarily restricting her diet\u2014it's important to approach it constructively. But the way the author is approaching it (probing, trying to get her to eat the foods) might be seen as disrespectful. The author should probably encourage the girlfriend to consult a healthcare professional rather than trying to test it themselves.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the girlfriend's health choices and trust. The right approach would be to discuss openly and support her decisions, even if they have doubts. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
