As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is doubting their girlfriend's reported intolerances to gluten, lactose, and sugar. They mention that these are rare and they're skeptical because the girlfriend used to eat them as a child. They've been trying to get her to test these foods again, but some friends suggested sneaking it in, which the person refuses to do. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. If she's been diagnosed with these intolerances, she might be experiencing real symptoms. Even if it's rare, it's possible. The author is doubting her, which could be hurtful. However, the author is concerned about her diet restrictions and wants her to eat freely again. \n\nThe author is trying to encourage her to try the foods again, which isn't necessarily wrong, but the method matters. They mention probing her about it, which might be seen as pushing her, but not forcing. The friends' suggestion to sneak the food is definitely crossing a line, and the author correctly refuses that. \n\nBut the core issue is the doubt. Doubting a partner's health issues can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. Intolerances can develop later in life, even if she had them as a child. The author's skepticism might stem from a place of wanting to help, but it's important to validate her experiences. \n\nThe author's actions of encouraging her to test the foods again could be well-intentioned, but they need to approach it with respect and support, not doubt. The key is whether the author is undermining her health concerns. If they're not forcing her and just suggesting, maybe it's not in the wrong. But the doubt itself can be harmful. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is respecting her autonomy and her reported symptoms. If they're pushing her to test it without proper medical advice, that's problematic. But they're open to her trying and aren't crossing lines. However, the initial doubt without evidence might make them in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering the options, the answer might be A (Yes) because doubting a partner's health issues can be harmful. But some might say B because the author isn't forcing her and is trying to help. However, the skepticism without evidence and the potential to invalidate her experiences likely makes the author in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
