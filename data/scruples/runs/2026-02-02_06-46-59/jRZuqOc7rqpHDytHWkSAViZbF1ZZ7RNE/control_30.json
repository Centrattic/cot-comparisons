As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The girl has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. He's skeptical and wants her to try eating them again, even suggests friends to test her reactions secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Gluten and lactose intolerance can develop later in life, right? So it's possible she's not faking it. The author is concerned because these are rare together. But that's not a given. Also, the author is trying to get her to test her own reactions, which might be seen as supportive if it's genuine. However, the friends suggesting to give her food without her knowing sounds like a bad idea. The author thinks that's crossing a trust line, which is a good point.\n\nThe key here is the approach. If the author is being respectful and discussing it openly, maybe that's okay. But if he's being dismissive or not trusting her experience, that's a problem. The fact that he's probing and suggesting she try the foods again might be seen as supportive if he's open to her feelings. However, the idea of secretly testing her reactions is definitely unethical and would break trust. The author is against that, which is right.\n\nBut the main question is whether doubting her is wrong. If he's expressing concern in a respectful way, that's okay. But if he's not believing her symptoms without evidence, that could be invalidating. Medical conditions can be real even if they're rare. The author's skepticism might be based on a lack of understanding or research. The fact that her mother might have influenced her could be a red flag, but without evidence, it's not fair to assume she's faking it.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. His intentions might be good, but he needs to approach it with empathy and respect her experiences. If he's being pushy or not listening to her, that's wrong. But if he's genuinely concerned and discussing it, maybe not. However, the main issue is whether his doubt is justified. Since he's the one questioning her, he might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her medical needs. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
