(She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about doubting his girlfriend's gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend has three intolerances, which the author considers rare. He's skeptical because he's heard cases where people are misdiagnosed or parents might influence their children's perception. He's trying to get her to test these foods again, thinking she might have developed them later. Friends suggested sneaking food with these ingredients to test her reactions, but he's against that because he values trust.\n\nSo, the main question is whether his doubt and approach are justified or if he's wrong. The author is in a position where he's challenging his partner's health conditions. Medical conditions can be personal and sensitive. Even if there's skepticism, approaching it with care is important. The fact that he's encouraging her to try the foods again isn't inherently wrong if done respectfully. But suggesting sneaky methods could damage trust. His friends' idea of sneaking food is definitely crossing a line, but the author is aware of that and avoids it. \n\nIs doubting a partner's health issues ever okay? It depends on the context. If there's medical evidence supporting her intolerances, doubting that could be problematic. However, if there's no formal diagnosis or if symptoms are inconsistent, the author's concern might be valid. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014probing and suggesting challenges\u2014could be seen as undermining her experiences. Trust and respect in a relationship are crucial. Even with skepticism, supporting her choices or discussing concerns openly is better than pushing her to test it. \n\nAlso, the fact that these intolerances restrict her diet adds another layer. If the author is pushing for her to eat them again without her consent, that could be seen as dismissive of her health. However, if he's genuinely concerned about her well-being and wants to ensure she's not avoiding unnecessary restrictions, there's a different angle. But without her agreement, his actions might not be supportive.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values respect for personal boundaries and health. The author's doubt isn't necessarily wrong if it's based on legitimate questions, but how he's handling it matters. Since he's trying to test her without sneaking and is aware of the trust issues, he might not be in the wrong. However, doubting someone's health issues can be seen as invalidating their experiences. The key is whether he's being respectful. If he's doing it in a supportive way, maybe not. But if he's dismissive, then yes. \n\nConsidering that he's trying to encourage her to test it again, perhaps he's not in the wrong if it's done with mutual agreement. But if she's already diagnosed and he keeps doubting without evidence, that could be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether the intolerances are medically confirmed. The scenario doesn't specify, so assuming they are, then doubting could be wrong. If not, maybe it's okay. Since the user says they're rare, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. \n\nOverall, the author's intention is to help, but the method might be questionable. However, the fact that he's not resorting to sneaky tactics is a plus. The community might side with him if he's respectful and not forcing her. But if his skepticism is causing her distress, then he's in the wrong. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) if his approach is respectful and open. But if he's being dismissive, then A. The original post says he's been \"skeptical\" and \"probing,\" which could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
