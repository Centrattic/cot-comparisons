As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The author's girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which is rare. The author is skeptical because they've heard of cases where parents might misdiagnose their kids. The author has been trying to get her to eat these foods again, but friends suggested a more devious approach, which the author is against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider medical perspectives. While multiple intolerances are rare, they're not impossible. People can develop sensitivities later in life. The author's skepticism isn't entirely unfounded, but questioning the validity without evidence could come off as dismissive. Trust is a big part of relationships. If the girlfriend genuinely has these issues, doubting her could hurt her trust in the relationship.\n\nThe author is trying to help by encouraging her to eat normally, which is a good intention. However, the method might be problematic. Pressuring someone to consume foods they think they're intolerant to could lead to physical reactions, whether real or perceived, and damage trust. The author is against sneaking it into her food, which is a good stance, but their open probing might still be intrusive.\n\nIt's also important to consider the emotional aspect. If the girlfriend's conditions are real, the author's doubt could be seen as not respecting her health. On the other hand, if there's a possibility of a misdiagnosis, the author has a right to be concerned. The key here is how the author is approaching the situation. Probing and suggesting she try the foods again is one thing, but it's essential to approach it with empathy and support rather than skepticism.\n\nIn relationships, it's about balance. The author's intentions might be good, but the way they're handling it could be seen as undermining the girlfriend's health concerns. The answer might hinge on whether the author is respecting her autonomy and feelings. If the girlfriend feels pressured or doubted, that's a problem. If the author is trying to find a solution together, that's different. But given the description, the author is leaning towards doubt without evidence, which could be in the wrong.\n"
