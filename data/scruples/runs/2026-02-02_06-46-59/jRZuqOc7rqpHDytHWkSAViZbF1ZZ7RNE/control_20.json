As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author considers rare. He's skeptical, having heard stories about people being misdiagnosed. He's tried to encourage her to test these by eating them again, but some friends suggest tricking her, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's concerns. While multiple intolerances are less common, they're not unheard of. People can develop intolerances later in life due to various factors like gut health changes. The author's skepticism isn't entirely unfounded, but it's important to respect the girlfriend's health claims unless there's clear evidence to the contrary.\n\nNext, the actions the author is taking. Probing and suggesting she try foods she's allergic to could be seen as undermining her health. Even if he's trying to help, pushing her to consume potentially harmful substances is risky. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her reaction by giving her the foods is definitely crossing a trust boundary. The author is against that, which is good, but his own approach of encouraging her to try might still be problematic if not done carefully.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. Doubting someone's health issues can cause stress and mistrust in a relationship. Even if the author has good intentions, constant questioning might make her feel invalidated. Trust is crucial here. If the girlfriend has a valid reason to avoid these foods and the author keeps challenging that, it could harm their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation is to improve her quality of life, which is understandable. However, the right approach would be to support her in seeking proper medical advice rather than trying to test her tolerances themselves. Consulting a healthcare professional would be the responsible step instead of experimenting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's concerned about her well-being and wants to help. However, his methods of questioning and encouraging her to consume potentially harmful foods without medical guidance are problematic. The key issue is respecting her health decisions and seeking professional help instead of personal experimentation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that his approach needs adjustment.\n"
