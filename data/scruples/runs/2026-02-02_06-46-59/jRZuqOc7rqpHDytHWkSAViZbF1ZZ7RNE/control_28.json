As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author doubting his girlfriend's multiple food intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author considers rare. He's skeptical, having heard stories about parents misdiagnosing their kids. He's been trying to get her to test these foods again, suggesting she might have developed the intolerances later. Some friends suggested secretly giving her the foods to see her reaction, but he thinks that's crossing a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. Doubting a partner's health conditions can be a sensitive issue. While it's true that some people might misdiagnose themselves, it's also important to respect their experiences and the medical advice they've received. The author is expressing concern and trying to help by encouraging her to test her tolerances, but the method could be problematic.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is skeptical, the girlfriend's conditions are rare, and the author is considering actions that might undermine trust. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way he's approaching it might be dismissive of her feelings and medical experiences. Forcing or pressuring someone to eat something they believe they're intolerant to could lead to harm, both physically and emotionally. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her is definitely crossing a trust line, and while the author is against that, his probing might still be seen as undermining her trust and health decisions.\n\nIn relationships, trust and mutual respect are crucial. If the author continues to doubt the girlfriend's conditions, it could lead to conflict. However, the author isn't outright dismissing her; he's trying to find a solution. But the right approach might be to support her, suggest consulting a medical professional, rather than pressuring her to test on her own. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe. He's not acting maliciously, but his doubts and probing could be harmful. It's possible that he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her health choices and is encouraging actions that might not be safe. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe it's a gray area. However, given the context, the author's actions are likely seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful, so the answer is A.\n"
