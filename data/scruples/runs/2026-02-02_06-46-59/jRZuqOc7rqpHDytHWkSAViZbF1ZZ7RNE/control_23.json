As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances. The situation is that the girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which is rare. The author is skeptical, especially because they are rare and she used to tolerate them. He's trying to get her to test it again, but friends suggested tricking her, which he's against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if doubting her is wrong. On one hand, his skepticism might be valid if these conditions are indeed rare. He's worried about her diet restrictions and wants her to be able to eat normally. But on the other hand, he's questioning her health, which can be sensitive. Trust in a relationship is important. If she's been diagnosed by a doctor, challenging her without evidence could harm trust. Also, even if the conditions are rare, that doesn't mean she doesn't have them. Medical conditions can vary, and some people might develop intolerances later in life.\n\nHe's not outright accusing her of lying, but his approach of urging her to test it again might come across as dismissive. The friends' suggestion to secretly test her is definitely crossing a line, and he's right to not want to do that. However, his probing might still be making her feel doubted. The key here is whether his skepticism is respectful and based on genuine concern, but the way he's approaching it might be the issue. It's possible that he's not in the wrong if he's trying to encourage her to verify her own health status, but if he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt and is being dismissive, then he could be in the wrong. \n\nSince the girlfriend has \"intolerances\" that are rare, and he's trying to urge her to test it, but not in a deceptive way, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe he should be more supportive regardless of his skepticism. It's a balance between concern and trust. The answer might depend on context not provided, like her actual symptoms or if there's medical evidence. But based on the given info, he's trying to help but in a way that's causing tension. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to be proactive, though he should be careful with how he approaches it. However, another angle is that doubting her health claims could be hurtful, so maybe A. Hmm.\n"
