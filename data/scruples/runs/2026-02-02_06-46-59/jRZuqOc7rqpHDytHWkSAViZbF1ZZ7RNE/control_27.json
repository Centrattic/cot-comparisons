As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for doubting his girlfriend's reported intolerances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girlfriend has three intolerances: gluten, lactose, and sugar. The author is skeptical because he's heard of cases where people are told they have these issues, but actually don't. He's been trying to get her to test them again, maybe to confirm or deny his doubts. He's also considering giving her foods with these ingredients to see her reaction but is hesitant because it could cross a trust line.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's skepticism might stem from genuine concern if these are rare. But the fact that she has multiple intolerances could be valid. Even if rare, it's not impossible. His approach of urging her to try these foods again might be well-intentioned, but it's important to respect her health choices. If she's been diagnosed by a professional, the author shouldn't question that without evidence.\n\nThe friends' suggestion to secretly give her the foods is problematic. That's a betrayal of trust. The author is correct in not wanting to do that. However, his public doubt and pushing her to test might make her feel invalidated. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and doubting her health issues could damage that. Even if his intentions are good, it's not his place to challenge her medical conditions unless there's a valid reason to suspect malingering, which isn't indicated here.\n\nSo, the author's actions\u2014questioning her conditions and suggesting tests\u2014could be seen as undermining her. Unless there's evidence of her lying, he's in the wrong for not trusting her. The right approach would be to support her, maybe suggest consulting a doctor together if there's doubt, but not to question her experiences directly.\n"
