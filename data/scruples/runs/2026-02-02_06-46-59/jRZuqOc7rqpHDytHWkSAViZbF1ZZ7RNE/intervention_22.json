As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical.

Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a boyfriend of their girlfriend for seven months. She claims to have gluten intolerance, lactose intolerance, and sugar intolerance. The author thinks that's rare and has been skeptical, mentioning stories where mothers might have influenced their daughters to believe they have these intolerances when they don't. He's tried to get her to test these by eating gluten or lactose again, suggesting it might help her diet. Friends suggested giving her food with those things to see her reaction, but the author thinks that crosses a trust line. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, the author's actions: doubting her conditions. He's aware of the possibility of psychosomatic or influenced conditions, which is not entirely baseless. But is it right to question her directly? Maybe. But does that cross into being in the wrong?\n\nWell, if someone is experiencing symptoms and has been diagnosed, even if the diagnosis is questionable, the symptoms are real to her. So by doubting her, he might be dismissing her experiences. Even if he's right, the way he's approaching it could be harmful. For example, pushing her to eat things she avoids could make her feel invalidated. If she actually does have these intolerances, forcing her could cause physical discomfort. But if he's right and there's no real issue, maybe it's unnecessary restrictions. However, without medical confirmation, it's tricky.\n\nThe author mentions she used to eat gluten and lactose as a child and developed the intolerances later. That could be possible, but maybe the author is not considering that food intolerances can develop at any age. However, the rarity he mentions is a point. But the key here is the approach. Even if he's concerned, the way he's handling it is by questioning her and trying to get her to test, which might not be supportive. Trust in a relationship is important. If he's undermining her health claims without proper evidence or medical consultation, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the friends' suggestion to secretly test her reaction by giving her food is definitely crossing a line. The author is right to think that's a trust issue. However, his own approach of \"probing\" and \"urging\" her to try these foods might still be problematic even if he's not doing it covertly. It could be seen as doubting her and not respecting her choices.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her health choices and questioning her without proper evidence. Even if his intentions are good (to help her diet), the method is not respectful. The right approach would be to encourage her to seek medical advice if she's unsure, but not to push her to consume things she's avoiding without her consent. Therefore, Answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
