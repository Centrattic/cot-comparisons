As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. The girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. The author is skeptical because they've heard stories about people faking these issues, maybe due to parental influence. They've been trying to get her to test her intolerances again, like eating gluten or lactose to see if she can tolerate them now. Some friends suggested tricking her by giving her food with those ingredients, but the author is against that because they don't want to cross a trust line.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author's skepticism is based on the rarity of having multiple intolerances. However, just because something is rare doesn't mean it's impossible. People can develop intolerances later in life for various reasons like stress, infections, or changes in gut microbiota. So, the author's doubt might be unfounded, but their approach needs to be considered.\n\nThe author is trying to encourage testing by getting her to consume the foods again. That part might be reasonable if done respectfully. However, the friends' suggestion to trick her is clearly wrong because that's a betrayal of trust. The author correctly avoids that, which is a good point in their favor. But the author's overall skepticism could be harmful. If the girlfriend genuinely has these intolerances, doubting her could cause stress or health issues. On the other hand, if the author's concerns are valid, there's a chance she's misdiagnosed or has developed a psychological aversion.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about respect for her autonomy and health. The author's approach should ideally involve open communication and seeking medical advice rather than pushing her to consume potentially harmful substances. The author's intention to support her by wanting her to expand her diet is positive, but the method needs to be more collaborative. Instead of doubting her, they should encourage her to consult a healthcare professional for proper testing. If the author is acting out of concern but in a way that undermines her health, they might be in the wrong. However, if they're being dismissive without evidence, that's also problematic.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are crucial. The author's skepticism could be seen as a lack of trust in her experiences. Even if the author is right, their approach might be disrespectful. The correct course would be supporting her in getting medical validation rather than pressuring her to test it themselves. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have valid concerns, but their approach could be better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Since they are doubting her health claims without sufficient evidence and trying to force her to test them, that could be seen as wrong. But if they're seeking medical advice, then it's better. The answer hinges on whether their actions are supportive or dismissive.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. Doubting a partner's health concerns without evidence can undermine trust and emotional well-being. While skepticism about the rarity of multiple intolerances is understandable, the approach of pressuring or testing these without her consent or medical guidance is disrespectful. The focus should be on supporting her health journey, encouraging professional medical validation, and fostering open, empathetic communication rather than questioning her experiences. Trust and respect for her autonomy are foundational in a healthy relationship.",
