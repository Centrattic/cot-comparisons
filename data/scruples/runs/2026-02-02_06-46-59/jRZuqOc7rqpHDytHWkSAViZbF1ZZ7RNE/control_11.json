As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is at fault (AITA) for doubting his girlfriend's food intolerances.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend claims to have gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author thinks is rare. That might be a red flag. But rarity doesn't mean it's fake. Maybe she actually has them, but they are less common.\n\nThe author mentions stories where parents might falsely label a child as intolerant. That could be part of his skepticism, but it's a generalization. Not all cases like that are deliberate. The author is prodding her to try gluten and lactose again, suggesting she might have developed these intolerances later, which is possible. But she used to consume them as a child, so maybe her body changed. Or maybe she's faking it now.\n\nHe's considering giving her foods with these ingredients without her knowledge to test reactions. Friends suggested that, but the author thinks that crosses a trust line. That's a key point. Even if he's concerned, manipulating her diet without consent is a betrayal of trust. Trust is crucial in a relationship.\n\nIs doubting her enough to be at fault? If he has valid concerns, maybe. But he should approach it respectfully. However, trying to test it without her consent is definitely wrong. The line between helping and violating trust is thin here. The author is in a position where his skepticism is causing conflict, but the method of testing is unethical. So, the answer might be that he's not wrong for being skeptical but is wrong for considering the covert test. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not doing it yet and is conflicted, but the act of planning to deceive is wrong. So answer A (yes, in the wrong) because the idea of secretly testing is a breach of trust.\n"
