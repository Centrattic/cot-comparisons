As far as I know, this is incredibly rare. Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been skeptical. I\u2019ve heard stories about mothers who deliberately decide that their daughter is \u201cintolerant\u201d of gluten, lactose etc when in reality, they\u2019re completely fine.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been probing it a bit more. Trying to urge her to try gluten again or try some milk and see if she can digest it again. (She used to have gluten and lactose as a child and has somehow \u201cdeveloped\u201d these conditions) I think it would be fantastic if she could eat these things again because it really restricts her diet.\n\nSome friends have suggested giving her food with gluten or lactose and seeing how she reacts to it but I think that is crossing a line of trust that I don\u2019t want to try. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for doubting their girlfriend's intolerances. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend has gluten, lactose, and sugar intolerances, which the author finds rare. They're skeptical because they've heard of parents misdiagnosing their kids. The author has been trying to get her to consume these foods again, thinking it would help her diet. Friends suggested secretly giving her the foods, but the author is against that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the girlfriend's intolerances. While multiple intolerances can be rare, they aren't impossible. People can develop food intolerances later in life due to various factors like gut health changes, infections, or other medical conditions. So the author's doubt might be based on a stereotype or lack of understanding.\n\nNext, the approach the author is taking. Encouraging the girlfriend to try the foods again isn't inherently wrong. If the author is doing so out of concern and with her knowledge, that's one thing. But the author is \"probing\" and \"urging,\" which might come from a place of not respecting her feelings or medical experiences. Also, the friends' suggestion to secretly test her reactions is definitely crossing a trust boundary. The author is right to avoid that.\n\nBut the main issue is the author's skepticism and how they're handling it. Doubting someone's health issues can be hurtful. Even if the author is worried about her diet, they should approach it with empathy and support. The girlfriend might feel invalidated, which can strain the relationship. The author should perhaps encourage her to get proper medical testing instead of doubting her. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, questioning rare conditions isn't automatically wrong, but the way they're doing it could be. The author's approach might be dismissive, which can be harmful. The right thing would be to support her in seeking professional confirmation if there's doubt, rather than pressuring her to eat the foods. So, the author is in the wrong for undermining her health concerns without evidence and for not respecting her experiences. Answer A.\n"
