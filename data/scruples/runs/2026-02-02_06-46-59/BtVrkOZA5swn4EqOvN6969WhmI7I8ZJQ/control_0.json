      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for directing someone to the Holocaust Museum when they wanted a hookup.\n\nFirst, the context: The author received a message from a stranger saying \"lemme smash,\" which is slang for a hookup. The author replied with an address to the Holocaust Museum. Then, they're asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nThe key elements here are consent, deception, and the appropriateness of the location. The Holocaust Museum is a place of remembrance and education about a tragic historical event. Using it as a meet-up spot for a sexual encounter is not only inappropriate but also shows a lack of respect for the victims and the museum's purpose.\n\nThe author's action was a prank, but it's a harmful one. They used deception by providing a false address that could lead someone to an inappropriate setting. This could cause emotional distress or embarrassment for the person who shows up expecting a different scenario. Even if the author didn't intend to have a real encounter, manipulating someone into going to a sensitive location for a joke crosses a line.\n\nAdditionally, the Holocaust is a deeply sensitive topic, and using it in this context can be seen as trivializing the suffering of those affected. The author might not have malicious intent, but the action itself is disrespectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they've engaged in behavior that's deceitful and inappropriate given the context of the location.\n"
