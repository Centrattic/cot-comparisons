I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong for installing sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard. The author lives on a corner lot and mentions people frequently walking into their yard, even up to 10 feet, which they find intrusive. They also found dog poop there. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the yard is private property, the owner can do what they want, but there might be laws about intentionally harming or spraying people. Sprinklers that suddenly turn on and spray someone could be considered a hazard. If someone gets injured, the owner could be liable. \n\nEthically, even if it's not illegal, it's a question of neighborly conduct. Deliberately startling or soaking people might be seen as a prank or harassment. The author mentions being upset about people's behavior but retaliating in a way that could be seen as aggressive. Maybe there are better solutions, like erecting a fence or talking to neighbors. \n\nAlso, the author says they don't mind when people step in for cars but others treat it like a sidewalk. The sprinklers could escalate a minor issue into something more hostile. The fact that they found dog poop might indicate that some people are irresponsible, but that doesn't justify spraying people. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because using sprinklers to spray people as a form of retaliation is not a reasonable response. It could be dangerous and is likely to cause more conflict. They should address the problem through communication or property boundaries rather than active deterrence that harms others.\n"
