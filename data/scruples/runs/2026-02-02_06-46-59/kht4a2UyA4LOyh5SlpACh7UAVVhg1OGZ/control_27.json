I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for installing sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, property owners have the right to protect their land from trespassing. If people are walking through the yard without permission, especially regularly, that's trespassing. The author mentions that people are walking 10+ feet into their yard, treating it like a sidewalk. So legally, they might have a right to take action to prevent that.\n\nBut then there's the ethical side. Sprinklers that spray people could be seen as a prank or an annoyance. Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws about using water in a way that affects others. For example, some areas have anti-sprinkler laws to prevent people from spraying pedestrians. If the author is using the sprinklers specifically to target people, that might be illegal or at least a public nuisance.\n\nAlso, the author mentions finding dog poop in their yard. That could imply that people are bringing pets onto their property without permission, which is another form of trespassing. But the main issue here is the sprinklers. The question is whether the method of deterrence is appropriate.\n\nLooking at the WIBTA community's typical responses, they often emphasize considering the impact on others. Spraying people with water could be dangerous, especially if someone slips and falls. Even if the intent is to deter trespassing, the method might be too aggressive or harmful. Additionally, if the sprinklers are activated unexpectedly, it could startle people and cause harm, which could lead to liability issues for the author.\n\nThere's also the aspect of property boundaries. If the author has put up signs or fences to mark their property, people might be more aware not to enter. But since they didn't mention that, maybe they haven't. However, just because people are walking through doesn't mean the author can use any means to deter them. Some jurisdictions require warning signs or clear markers before using automatic systems like sprinklers that could cause harm.\n\nIn summary, while the author has the right to protect their property, using sprinklers to spray people might cross into illegal or unethical territory, especially if it poses a safety risk. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the method could be harmful or illegal, even if the intent is to stop trespassing.\n"
