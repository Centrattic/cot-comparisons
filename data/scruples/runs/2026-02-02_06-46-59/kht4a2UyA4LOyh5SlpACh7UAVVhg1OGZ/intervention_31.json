      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) question is in the wrong for installing sprinklers that spray people who walk through their yard. The scenario is that the author lives on a corner lot and people are walking through their yard, entering up to 10+ feet, getting close enough to see into the windows, and even leaving dog poop. The author wants to use sprinklers to spray these people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, property owners have the right to protect their land, but using sprinklers that intentionally target people might be an issue. If the sprinklers are activated to surprise or startle people, that could be considered a form of assault or battery, depending on the jurisdiction. Even if it's not intended to harm, causing a shock or slip could lead to liability. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. While the author is upset about people trespassing, using a prank like sprinklers might be seen as excessive. Trespassing is a civil issue, and the appropriate response would be to address the behavior through means like setting up a fence, talking to the neighbors, or contacting local authorities. Spraying people with water could be seen as a hostile action, even if it's not physical harm. It might escalate tensions, especially if someone gets injured.\n\nAlso, the author mentions finding dog poop in the yard. That's a separate issue, but the main concern is the sprinkler setup. The intention here is to deter people by surprising them, which can be dangerous. People might slip and fall, leading to injuries. The author could be held responsible for any resulting harm.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms. While the author isn't a \"cranky old man,\" the method they're considering might not be socially acceptable. Neighbors might see it as a prank rather than a serious deterrent. There's also the aspect of public perception; using sprinklers in a way that targets people could lead to a reputation of being hostile or vindictive.\n\nHowever, the author is within their rights to own the property and set boundaries. The key is the method used. If the sprinklers are automatic and non-harmful, maybe, but since the purpose is to spray people intentionally, it crosses into potentially harmful territory. The line between a prank and a harmful act is thin here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to protect their property, the method proposed is likely inappropriate and could lead to legal or social consequences. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
