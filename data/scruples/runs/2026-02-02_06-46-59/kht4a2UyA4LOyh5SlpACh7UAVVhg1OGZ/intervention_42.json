I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to install sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard is in the wrong. The situation is that the person lives on a corner lot, people are walking through their yard, sometimes up to 10 feet, and even leaving dog poop. They're considering installing sprinklers to deter this.\n\nFirst, I need to think about property rights and what's reasonable. In many places, property owners have the right to control their land, but there are limits when it comes to safety and harassment. Sprinklers that actively spray people might be considered a form of retaliation or harassment, especially if it's intentional to startle or inconvenience others. \n\nAlso, the fact that people are walking through the yard suggests that the property might be being used as a shortcut. If the yard isn't a public sidewalk, the owners have the right to prevent that. However, using a prank like sprinklers could be seen as excessive. There might be other, less intrusive ways to address the issue, like erecting a fence or signs. \n\nAdditionally, there's the issue of public safety. If someone is sprayed, they might slip, fall, or be injured, leading to potential liability for the person who installed the sprinklers. Even if it's not meant to harm, accidental injury could be a problem. \n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author mentions they get annoyed by people encroaching, but reacting with something that could be seen as a prank might not be the best approach. It's possible that the neighbors might find it offensive or dangerous. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, while the author has a right to protect their property, the method they're considering could be seen as crossing a line into harassment or creating a hazard. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
