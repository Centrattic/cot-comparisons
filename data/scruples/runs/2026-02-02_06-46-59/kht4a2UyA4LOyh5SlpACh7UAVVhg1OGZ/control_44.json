I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"What Would You Do?\" question is in the wrong for planning to install sprinklers that spray people walking through their yard.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lives on a corner lot and people frequently walk through their yard. They mention that some people walk 10+ feet into their yard, get close to windows, and even leave dog poop. The author is considering installing sprinklers to spray these people as a deterrent.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, property owners have the right to protect their property. However, intentionally spraying people with water could be a different matter. In many places, it's illegal to use water as a weapon or to cause harm, even if it's just a surprising spray. There could be liability if someone is injured or if it's considered a form of harassment.\n\nAdditionally, there's the social aspect. Even if it's not illegal, it might be seen as cruel or unnecessary. Neighbors might feel targeted, and it could lead to conflicts. The author's intention is to deter people from entering, but using a prank-like method like sprinklers might be seen as excessive when there are other, more peaceful solutions available, such as fencing or talking to the neighbors.\n\nHowever, the author isn't using physical force or causing harm beyond a water spray. If the sprinklers are just a surprise deterrent without causing injury, maybe some jurisdictions would consider it a minor issue. But generally, causing someone to be sprayed unexpectedly could be seen as a form of assault or battery, depending on local laws.\n\nAlso, the presence of dog poop is a separate issue. The author could address that by talking to the community or local authorities, but using sprinklers to retaliate isn't a standard solution.\n\nSo, considering both legal and social perspectives, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using a method that could be legally actionable and socially unacceptable. There are better ways to address the issue without resorting to pranks that could harm or annoy others.\n"
