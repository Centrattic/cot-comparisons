I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight-identifying man who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when he was single, then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author later felt uncomfortable and ended it. Now the friend is being distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to some same-sex experiences but not necessarily a committed relationship. The friend is gay, so he's likely looking for more than just a one-sided sexual arrangement. The author might have led the friend on by not being clear about his intentions. Even if he said he's straight, the ongoing sexual activity could create mixed signals. \n\nWhen the author ended the arrangement, it might have left the friend feeling rejected or used. The author's message saying they should stop might not have been enough to address the friend's feelings. The fact that the friend was fine when they first started but became upset after the author ended it suggests that the friend may have developed feelings beyond just the sexual aspect. \n\nAlso, the author is now upset because they lost a friend. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. From a fairness perspective, if the friend felt the arrangement was mutual and then it was abruptly stopped, the author might be at fault for not being upfront about the non-committal nature of their arrangement. The author might have led the friend on without considering his emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did clarify his orientation and boundaries, and ended things when he felt uncomfortable. But in relationships, even if they're not romantic, consistent communication is key. The author might not have considered the friend's emotional investment. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he may have led the friend on without clear boundaries and then ended things without addressing the emotional impact, even if unintentionally.\n"
