I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight guy and his gay friend who offered him a blowjob. The author, being heteroflexible, accepted and engaged in this a few times. Then he got a girlfriend, so they stopped, but after the breakup, they started again. Later, the author tried to reciprocate but felt bad and ended the arrangement. Now his friend is distant, and the author is questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. The friend knew this and offered the service. However, the author continued the arrangement even after getting a girlfriend, which might have led to confusion or emotional attachment on the friend's part. Even though the author said it was clear, maybe the friend had hope for something more. When the author ended it, the friend felt rejected, leading to the coldness.\n\nAlso, the author tried to reciprocate, which might have made the friend feel that the author was trying to turn things into a mutual or more balanced relationship, which then wasn't followed through. The author's actions might have given false hope, even if unintentionally. The friend's hurt feelings suggest that the author's actions did lead to emotional harm.\n\nHowever, the author didn't misrepresent his feelings and was honest. The friend initiated the arrangement, so maybe the onus is on the friend to understand the boundaries. But in relationships, even if there's an agreement, emotions can complicate things. The author's decision to stop was his right, but the way it was handled might have been abrupt, leading to the friend's resentment.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit murky. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the ongoing physical relationship might have created unspoken expectations. The key is whether there was an understanding that this was strictly a physical, non-romantic arrangement. If that was clear, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. But if the friend interpreted it as something more, then the author might share some responsibility for the friend's feelings. However, the friend's actions in continuing the arrangement after the author had a girlfriend and then getting distant might be his own issue. The author's actions, while not malicious, could have been seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because, even if he didn't mean to, his actions could have led the friend to believe there was a chance for more, which the author then closed off. Alternatively, if the arrangement was explicit, then B (not in the wrong) could be correct. But since the author's friend was \"cool\" before and then became distant after the breakup and the author's attempt to reciprocate, the emotional impact suggests that the author's actions had consequences, making him partly responsible. So the answer might be A.\n"
