I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the described situation. First, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a close gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They continued this arrangement for some time. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped, which the friend was okay with. After the breakup, they resumed the activity, but the author later felt uncomfortable and reciprocated, then decided to stop. Now the friend is acting cold.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement. The friend was aware of the author's sexual orientation and that there was no romantic involvement. When the author decided to stop, he did so politely. The friend's reaction of becoming distant might be due to hurt feelings or not feeling respected when the author reciprocated, even if it was brief. \n\nThe author's actions: They didn't mislead about their orientation. They stopped when it made them uncomfortable. However, the act of reciprocating might have confused the boundaries the friend had. The friend might have felt used or that the author wasn't respecting his feelings. \n\nThe author's responsibility lies in maintaining clear communication. After reciprocating, the author realized it wasn't right and stopped, which shows they tried to address it. However, the friend's reaction suggests that the author's actions, even if well-intentioned, might have caused emotional harm. \n\nThe friends were close, and the author is now struggling with the fallout. The community's advice to leave the friend alone might be because the author's actions contributed to the friend's discomfort. But the author feels it's not their fault since they were clear about their intentions all along.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author didn't force the friend or lie. But engaging in mutually consensual acts and then changing the dynamics might have led to the friend feeling unappreciated or unrespected. The author's decision to reciprocate could have crossed an unspoken boundary, even if unintended. The author's responsibility is to acknowledge the friend's feelings and perhaps apologize if needed, but whether they're in the wrong depends on the friend's perspective. However, since the initial arrangement was consensual and the author made a mistake in reciprocating, there's a case to say the author did something wrong by not considering the friend's feelings during that act. But the author did stop and communicate, so maybe not entirely in the wrong. This is a bit of a grey area. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being entirely in the wrong but having caused unintentional harm. However, since the friend's actions are now cold, perhaps the author's actions led to this, making them at fault. But the initial act was consensual. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A (Yes) because the author's reciprocation without considering the friend's feelings was a mistake, leading to the friend's hurt. Or B (No) because all was consensual and the author acted in good faith. The line here is thin. The key is whether the author's actions crossed a line of respect. Since the author is heteroflexible and the friend is gay, the reciprocation might have made the friend uncomfortable. The author's mistake was in reciprocating, which the friend might have seen as insincere or using him. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for that act, even if they later stopped. But the initial arrangement was okay. So the main issue is the reciprocation. Therefore, answer A.\n"
