I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male. He had a good friend who's gay and offered a blowjob. The author accepted, and they engaged in this several times over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, which stopped the arrangement. After a breakup, they resumed. The author later reciprocated, felt bad, and decided to stop. The friend became cold, leading to the author's confusion and seeking advice.\n\nNow, I need to assess whether the author is at fault. The main issues here are consent, communication, and the nature of the relationship. The author claims he was clear about his orientation and that there was no romantic involvement. However, the friend might have had different expectations or feelings. \n\nThe key points to consider: \n- Was there mutual consent each time? It seems so initially.\n- Did the author lead the friend on by not setting clear boundaries? The author says he was clear, but maybe the friend thought there was a chance of a romantic relationship.\n- When the author reciprocated, he felt guilty and ended things. That might have been abrupt for the friend, causing the cold response.\n- The friend's reaction could stem from feeling used or unappreciated, especially after reciprocation and then being told it's not what the author wants.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the friend thought there was a possibility of a deeper relationship, which the author didn't clarify. Also, the act of reciprocating and then stopping might have caused confusion. However, since both are adults and the initial acts were consensual, it's a bit nuanced. The main issue here is the aftermath and the friend's feelings of being led on, which the author might have inadvertently done by continuing the arrangement after the girlfriend situation. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, could have been insensitive to the friend's emotional state. So, AITA might lean towards the author being at fault for not maintaining clear boundaries and causing emotional distress.\n"
