I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a one-sided sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when both were single, continued after the author got a girlfriend (and then stopped when the girlfriend came back), and then resumed after the breakup. The author later felt uncomfortable and ended the physical relationship, which led to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused about whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's actions: accepting blowjobs from a gay friend, continuing the arrangement after a girlfriend, then stopping after feeling bad. The friend's reaction is being cold and distant. The author claims they were clear about their orientation and the boundaries of the relationship. Others in the community suggested the author led the friend on, hence the author's confusion.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, there's the issue of consent and communication. Both parties initially agreed to the arrangement. However, the author later changed their mind and communicated that clearly. The problem arises in whether the friend felt led on. The author might have given mixed signals by engaging in the relationship when they had a girlfriend and then stopping. The friend's feelings of rejection or being used could be valid, but the author did try to be honest about their orientation and boundaries. However, the act of continuing the arrangement after the girlfriend left and then stopping might have caused emotional harm. The author's responsibility includes being clear from the start about the non-romantic nature of the relationship and ensuring the friend isn't expecting anything more. If the author didn't communicate effectively or if the friend's expectations were not aligned, that's where the issue could lie. Since the author did stop it once they felt bad and communicated it nicely, they might not be entirely at fault. But the ongoing arrangement after a breakup could be seen as perpetuating a cycle that the friend might have misinterpreted. So, there's a balance between consent and the emotional impact. The answer might be that the author is partially at fault for not setting clearer boundaries from the beginning and for the inconsistency in the arrangement, leading to the friend's hurt feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
