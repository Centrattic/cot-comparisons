A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the points.\n\nThe author is a heterosexual, heteroflexible guy. He had a gay friend who offered a blowjob, and since he was single and horny, he agreed. They did this a few times over weeks or months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. At some point, the author decided to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, so he told his friend to stop. Now, the friend has become distant and cold. The author is confused because others said he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author engaged in a sexual activity with a friend, which they both agreed to. However, when the author started a romantic relationship, he stopped the arrangement. Once the relationship ended, he resumed. The friend then offered to reciprocate, but the author refused. The friend is now upset and distant, leading the author to question if he's at fault.\n\nThe main issues here seem to be consent, communication, and the emotional impact on the friend. The author might argue that there was mutual consent and that things were clear from the start. However, the friend might feel used or emotionally hurt, especially after the author reciprocated and then refused. Even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the friend's feelings could have been hurt by the author's actions, particularly after reciprocating. The act of reciprocation might have given the friend hope for a more mutual relationship, which the author then rejected, leading to emotional distress. \n\nAlso, the author's actions of engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend while in a committed relationship (even if it was after the breakup) could be seen as inconsistent or disrespectful. The friend might have developed feelings beyond just the physical aspect, especially if the author's reciprocation was a sign of interest. The author's refusal after reciprocating could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if there was no romantic intent.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author was clear from the beginning that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship, that might mitigate some of the blame. However, the friend might still feel that the author used him for sexual favors without considering his emotional well-being. The key here is whether the author's actions, even if consensual, caused harm that the author should have anticipated.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic and the emotional connection between the two. If they were close friends, the author's actions might have crossed a line that the friend felt was important. The author's decision to reciprocate and then pull back could have been confusing or hurtful to the friend, especially if the friend had developed feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to, the friend's perspective is valid, and the author should consider that their actions, though consensual, had emotional consequences.\n\nIn terms of social norms and expectations, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend can complicate the friendship, especially if the sexual aspect is one-sided. The author's friend might have felt that the relationship was more significant than just physical, leading to feelings of rejection when the author stopped. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's emotional state and for not maintaining clear boundaries from the start.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was clear, and if the friend didn't express his feelings earlier, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the fact that the author reciprocated and then pulled back could be the point where the friend felt used. The author should have been more considerate of the friend's feelings, even if the initial arrangement was consensual. The friend's reaction suggests that he felt hurt, and the author's responsibility might lie in not recognizing or addressing that emotional impact.\n\nIn conclusion, while the actions were consensual and the author may not have intended harm, the emotional consequences on the friend indicate that the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings and for maintaining a one-sided sexual arrangement that led to hurt feelings. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
