I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a heterosexual-identified person engaging in oral sex with a gay friend, then breaking off the relationship after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up with her. The friend became distant, and the author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The author and the friend started the arrangement when both were okay with it. The friend was described as gay, so maybe he had his own reasons for engaging. The author later stopped, probably due to feeling uncomfortable after reciprocating, which could have been a sign of guilt or discomfort. \n\nThen, after the author ended the arrangement, the friend became cold. The author tried to reach out but got minimal responses. The question is whether the author is wrong for ending the arrangement. \n\nThe author claims they were clear about being straight and not wanting a romantic relationship. But maybe the friend saw the physical relationship as more than just a favor or mutual arrangement. The author might have taken advantage of the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. \n\nAlso, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which suggests the arrangement was not serious. But when the girlfriend dumped them, they resumed, which could be seen as using the friend for sexual favors. The act of reciprocating and then immediately regretting it might indicate that the author's actions made the friend feel used or that the relationship was one-sided. \n\nThe author's friends and others said it's their fault for leading the friend on. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friend might have felt emotionally invested. The author's decision to end the physical relationship could have caused emotional harm, regardless of the initial clarity. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the key points are consent, mutual respect, and emotional impact. If the friend felt that the author was using him for sex without emotional reciprocity, then the author might be at fault. The fact that the author felt bad after reciprocating suggests some level of discomfort that they might have ignored or not communicated properly. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they continued the arrangement even if it wasn't reciprocal in emotional terms, leading to the friend's hurt feelings. Ending the relationship abruptly could have been careless, even if it was clear from the start that there was no romantic interest.\n"
