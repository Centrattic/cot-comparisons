I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on a situation they described. I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. They had a sexual arrangement where the friend gave blowjobs. Then, the author got a girlfriend and they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. After feeling guilty, the author reciprocated but then decided to stop. Now, the friend is acting cold, and the author is confused because he thought he was clear about his heterosexuality.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and emotional impact. The author initiated and continued the sexual activity, which might imply some level of mutual agreement. However, when he ended it, the friend became distant. The author claims he was clear about not being interested romantically, but the friend's feelings might have developed beyond just the physical aspect. Even if the author is straight, engaging in repeated sexual acts with a friend could lead to emotional attachment or unmet expectations on the friend's side. The author's decision to stop might have hurt the friend's feelings, especially if the friend saw it as rejection beyond just the physical relationship. The author might not have considered the emotional implications of their actions on the friend. While the author didn't lead on with romantic intentions, the sexual relationship itself could have created a dynamic where the friend felt hopeful or attached. The author's guilt and the friend's cold response suggest that the situation caused emotional harm, making the author partially at fault for not managing the friendship carefully during and after the sexual arrangement. So, considering all that, the answer is likely A.\n"
