I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is he's a straight, heteroflexible guy who accepted blowjobs from his gay friend. They were good friends, then he got a girlfriend, they stopped, she dumped him, they started again. Then he felt bad and reciprocated, but then stopped because he's not into that. Now his friend is being cold and distant, and others say it's his fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both parties were 18, so legally adults. The friend offered, he accepted. As long as both were consensual and there was no pressure, maybe that's okay. But when the author reciprocated, he felt bad and stopped. Maybe that was a mistake? Because if the friend was used to giving and now the balance changed, maybe it made the friend feel used or unappreciated. \n\nThe author says it was clear he's straight and not interested in a relationship. But the friend is gay, so maybe he hoped for more? Or maybe the dynamic of the friendship changed after the sexual activity. When the author reciprocated once but then stopped, maybe the friend felt confused or hurt. \n\nThen, when the author tries to reconnect, the friend is distant. The author feels bad because they were close friends. Others say he led the friend on, but the author didn't intend to. The key points here are communication and boundaries. Did the author communicate his feelings clearly? When he reciprocated once but then stopped, maybe that sent mixed signals. Also, continuing the arrangement while being in a relationship (even after the breakup) might complicate things. \n\nThe author's friend might have felt that the author was using him, especially when he started again after the breakup. The act of reciprocating once could have made the friend feel that the author was trying to move towards a more mutual sexual relationship, but then pulling back. That inconsistency might have caused the friend's hurt feelings. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? If there was clear communication from the start that it's just about the BJ, no romantic feelings, but the actions (starting again after the breakup, reciprocating) may have blurred the lines and led to confusion. The author might be responsible for not maintaining consistent boundaries and possibly leading the friend to hope for more than just a one-sided arrangement. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of leading on and not maintaining clear boundaries.\n"
