I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who accepted blowjobs from a gay friend, then later stopped, causing a rift.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend is gay and offered the Blowjob. The author is straight but okay with it, which he mentions as heteroflexible. They engaged in this over weeks/months, then stopped when the author had a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author then felt bad and stopped again. The friend got cold, and the author is confused about why it's his fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate. The author didn't mislead about his orientation; he was clear he's straight and not interested in a relationship. However, the friend might have hoped for more. The author's actions, while consensual, might have led to emotional expectations the friend had. When the author stopped, it hurt the friend's feelings. The author then tries to reconcile, but the friend is distant. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was explicit about his orientation and the arrangement was mutual and consensual, he might not be at fault. However, the friend's feelings might be hurt because the author's sexual flexibility doesn't equate to emotional availability. The author might have unintentionally led the friend to believe there could be more, but if it was clear from the start that it's just physical, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. But maintaining a friendship post-breakup might require sensitivity. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions crossed into emotional manipulation or if it was purely physical with no expectations. Given the details, the author was honest, but the friend might have had unmet emotional needs. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after feeling uncomfortable. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
