I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the situation described. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped after getting a girlfriend, and later resumed after the breakup. He tried to reciprocate but felt bad and ended it, leading to the friend being distant. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is straight but heteroflexible, which means he's open to some same-sex interactions. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men. The initial arrangement was a blowjob, which is a sexual act. The key points here are consent, communication, and the boundaries of their friendship.\n\nWhen the author was single, he agreed to the sexual activity. Then, when he had a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows some consideration for the girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed. The problem comes when the author tries to reciprocate by sucking the friend, which makes him uncomfortable. He then ends the arrangement, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nThe main issues here are:\n\n1. The author may have led the friend on by engaging in a sexual relationship, even if he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. The friend might have hoped for more or felt used. However, the author claims he was clear about his orientation and that there was no romantic involvement.\n\n2. The friend's reaction of becoming cold and distant could be due to feeling rejected or unappreciated. The author's attempt to reciprocate might have been a mistake, as it's possible the friend didn't expect or want it. The author then stopped, but the damage to the friendship might be done.\n\n3. The author is now trying to repair the friendship but the friend is ignoring him. The author is confused because he thought he was clear about his boundaries.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author might be at fault for engaging in a sexual relationship that could have led to emotional expectations. Even if there was consent, the lack of clear boundaries about the nature of the relationship (just sexual vs. seeking more) could be an issue. The author might have not communicated his intentions clearly, leading the friend to feel used or rejected. The friend's reaction is hurtful, but the author's actions may have contributed to the breakdown in their friendship.\n\nHowever, the author did stop the activity when he felt uncomfortable and tried to maintain a friendship. The friend's response is extreme, but that doesn't absolve the author of any responsibility if his actions were misleading. The key here is whether the author was clear about his intentions from the start. If he was upfront about his heterosexuality and not interested in a romantic relationship, then maybe he's not entirely at fault. But if there were mixed signals, then he could be in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's reaction is harsh, the author may have contributed to the situation by engaging in a sexual relationship that could have created emotional expectations. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he may have led the friend on by not setting clear boundaries about the nature of their interactions.\n"
