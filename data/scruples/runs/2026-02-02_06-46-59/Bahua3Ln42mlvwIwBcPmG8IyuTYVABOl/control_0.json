I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, from the description, the key points are:\n\n1. The author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They had blowjobs over a period of weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, and when the author broke up with her, they resumed the arrangement. \n\n2. Later, the author felt bad about it, reciprocated once (sucked his friend), then decided to stop. The friend became distant and cold. The author is confused because he thought he was clear about his straightness and that there was no romantic or emotional attachment, but others say he led the friend on.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author says that they were clear from the start that he's straight and there's no romantic involvement. If that was communicated and mutual, then maybe it was a consensual arrangement. However, in relationships, even if you're sexually active without emotional commitment, there can be unspoken expectations. The friend might have hoped for more, or felt used when the author stopped.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the friend. The author ended the arrangement suddenly, even though they were friends before and after. The friend's coldness suggests he might feel rejected or hurt, which the author didn't anticipate. The author tried to reach out (big Christmas message) but got a minimal response. The author is now upset because they want to maintain the friendship.\n\nOthers in a different sub said the author led the friend on. Even if the author didn't intend to, the friend might have perceived it as ongoing. The author might have given mixed signals, especially after the girlfriend situation. When the author started again after the breakup, maybe the friend thought there was a chance for something more, which wasn't there.\n\nAlso, when the author reciprocated once, that might have made the friend feel something was changing, but then the author stopped. Maybe the friend felt used or that the author was treating the relationship as transactional. The author's admission that he felt awful and sick after reciprocating suggests he felt it was wrong, which could indicate he didn't want to reciprocate and saw it as a mistake.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the arrangement was purely sexual and both knew it, then the author stopping it isn't necessarily wrong. But if the friend felt emotionally invested or used, then the author's abrupt stop might be insensitive. The key is whether the author's actions were communicated clearly and if he respected the friend's feelings. If the author didn't consider how his actions might affect the friend's emotions, then he might be at fault for not being more considerate, even if the initial arrangement was consensual.\n\nAlso, considering the ages (both 18), they might still be learning about relationships and boundaries. But generally, if they were explicit about no emotional attachment and the arrangement was mutual, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he ended it might have been abrupt, leading to the friend's hurt feelings. \n\nBut the others in the sub say he led him on. If the friend believed there was a chance for more than just sex, then the author might have unintentionally given false hope. Even if the author was clear, the friend might have misinterpreted the situation. In that case, the author might still be at fault for not maintaining clear boundaries throughout.\n\nAnother point is that after the girlfriend situation, when the author went back to the friend, maybe the friend thought the author was now available for more, but the author only wanted the sexual arrangement again. The friend might have hoped for a romantic or deeper connection, which the author didn't want. \n\nSo, the author might have been in the wrong if he didn't consistently reinforce that there's no emotional commitment and if his actions (like stopping abruptly after reciprocating once) gave the friend hope that might not have been realistic. The friend's hurt feelings are valid even if the author didn't mean to lead him on. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because even if the arrangement was consensual initially, the way it's ended and the lack of ongoing communication might have led to the friend feeling used or hurt, which the author should have considered and handled more sensitively.\n"
