I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this multiple times over weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, so they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the author felt bad and tried to reciprocate but felt awful and told the friend to stop. Now, the friend is distant, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are 18, so minors in many places, but maybe the legal age is different. The author was clear he's not gay and wouldn't pursue a relationship. The friend initiated the act, and the author didn't lead him on, according to him. But the friend might have had different expectations.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author says he was honest about his orientation. However, engaging in sexual acts with a friend, even if it's a mutual agreement, can lead to complications if there's an imbalance in the relationship. The friend might have developed feelings or felt the arrangement was more significant than the author intended. When the author decided to stop, the friend's reaction could be due to feeling rejected or unappreciated, especially if he had emotional investment.\n\nThe term \"heteroflexible\" might mean the author is open to some same-sex encounters but not a committed relationship. The friend, being gay, might have wanted more, but the author made it clear that it was a physical arrangement. However, when the author reciprocated once, it might have given the friend false hope. Then the author quickly backed out, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014accepting oral sex, continuing the arrangement, and then stopping\u2014could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. The friend might feel used or that the relationship became transactional. The author's message to the friend after Christmas was met with a cold response, indicating the friend is hurt and possibly feels betrayed.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might be at fault for not setting clearer boundaries from the start. Even if the author was honest about his orientation, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend who has different feelings can cause harm. The author's decision to stop without considering the friend's potential emotional state might have contributed to the friend's reaction.\n\nAdditionally, the author's initial acceptance and the ongoing arrangement might have given the friend the impression of a mutual, consensual pact. However, the power dynamic could be skewed if one person is more emotionally invested. The friend might have felt that the author took advantage of his affection.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have intended to lead the friend on, the ongoing nature of the arrangement and the sudden cessation could have caused emotional harm. The author should have considered the friend's feelings and communicated more clearly about the nature of their interactions to prevent misunderstandings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
