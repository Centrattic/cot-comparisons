I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a straight-identifying guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend. They started when he was single, then stopped when he got a girlfriend, but resumed after the breakup. The author felt bad and tried to reciprocate, but found it uncomfortable and ended things. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused about whether he's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, the author is heterosexual and heteroflexible. His friend is gay. The friend offered a blowjob, which the author accepted. The key points here are consent and mutual agreement. If both parties were okay with the arrangement and it was consensual, then there's no immediate issue. However, the author later felt guilty and ended it, which might have upset the friend. \n\nWhen the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows he respected the relationship. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. The author tried to reciprocate once, felt uncomfortable, and ended things. The friend's reaction is now being cold and distant. The author is trying to reconnect, but the friend is avoiding it.\n\nNow, some people said the author led the friend on, but he claims he was clear about his sexuality. The problem here might be communication. Even if the author thought it was clear he wasn't interested romantically, the friend might have developed feelings over time. The act of reciprocating might have been a mistake, as it could imply more than just a one-time thing. Also, the author's friend might feel rejected or used when the arrangement ended.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as exploiting the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. The friend might have wanted a deeper connection that the author wasn't willing to provide. The author's decision to end the arrangement might have been abrupt, leading to hurt feelings. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how ending things would affect his friend's emotions, even if they were just physical interactions. The friendship's breakdown could be due to unmet emotional needs from the friend's side, which the author didn't address properly.\n"
