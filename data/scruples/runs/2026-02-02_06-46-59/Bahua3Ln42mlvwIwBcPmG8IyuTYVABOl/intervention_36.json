I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author and a gay friend started a non-consensual sexual arrangement, which I should clarify, but the user mentioned it was mutual. The friend offered, and the author accepted. Later, after the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the relationship ended, they resumed. The author then reciprocated, felt bad, and ended things, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nI need to consider consent and communication. Both parties agreed initially, so maybe that's okay. But when the author reciprocated, that might have been a problem since the friend is gay. The author might have crossed a boundary by reciprocating, making the friend feel pressured. Even if the author didn't mean to lead them on, the act of returning the favor could have been confusing or hurtful. The friend's cold response suggests they felt used or disrespected. The author's friends said they led him on, which might be true if the reciprocation wasn't clear. The author's actions might have made the friend feel like their feelings were being toyed with. So, the author could be at fault for not being clear about their boundaries and for reciprocating without considering the friend's feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
