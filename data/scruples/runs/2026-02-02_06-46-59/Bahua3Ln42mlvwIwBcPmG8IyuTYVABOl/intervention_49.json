I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a straight heteroflexible male who had a good friendship with a gay friend. The friend offered to give him a blowjob, and they engaged in this a few times. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. The author then reciprocated by sucking the friend but immediately felt bad and told him to stop. Now the friend is cold and distant, and the author is trying to reconnect but the friend isn't responding well. The author is confused because he thought it was clear he's straight and didn't want a romantic relationship, but friends are saying he led the friend on.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author and his friend had an arrangement where they engaged in oral sex. The author later reciprocated but felt bad and ended the arrangement. Now the friend is upset. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial part. The author is heterosexual but \"heteroflexible,\" which I think means he's open to same-sex encounters. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men. The author accepted the friend's offer, which might have been a mutual agreement. But the author's friend might have had different expectations. Maybe the friend felt that the author was reciprocating was a step towards a more committed relationship, even if the author didn't intend that.\n\nWhen the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which seems responsible because cheating isn't okay. But when the author's girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. Then, the author tried to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, leading him to end it. The friend is now upset.\n\nThe author claims he was clear that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, actions can speak louder than words. By engaging in sexual activity, even if it's just oral sex, it might have given the friend hope for more, especially if the author reciprocated. Reciprocating could be seen as a sign of mutual interest beyond just casual encounters. The author then ended it, which might have left the friend feeling rejected or used.\n\nThe friends who said it's the author's fault might think he led the friend on by continuing the arrangement for a while and then breaking it off without proper closure. The author's message to the friend over Christmas was met with a minimal response, indicating the friend is still hurt. The author wants to reconnect, but the friend isn't responding, which suggests the friendship is damaged.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the actions might have implied more than just casual encounters. The friend might have felt attached, especially since the author was his close friend. Engaging in sexual activity can complicate friendships and set up expectations that aren't met. The author ending the arrangement abruptly without considering the friend's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he didn't have romantic intentions.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to reciprocate once, even if he felt bad afterward, might have given the friend the impression that the author was becoming more open to a reciprocal relationship. Then, when the author changed his mind, it might have been emotionally difficult for the friend to handle. The author's responsibility here is to communicate clearly and manage expectations from the start to avoid hurting the friend's feelings.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended harm, the actions could have led the friend to feel used or rejected, making the author at least partially at fault for not managing the situation with more care and empathy, especially considering the friend's feelings and the nature of their close relationship.\n"
