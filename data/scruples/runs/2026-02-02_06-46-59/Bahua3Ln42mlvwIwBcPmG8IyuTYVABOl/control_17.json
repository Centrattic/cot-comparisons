I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because others said he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is straight but heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to same-sex encounters. The friend is gay, so the author's actions might have given the friend false hope for a romantic relationship. Even if the author didn't intend to lead on, the friend's perspective is important. The author stopped the arrangement after feeling guilty when the friend reciprocated, but the friend is now upset and distant. \n\nThe question is about accountability. The author didn't explicitly promise anything, but the ongoing sexual relationship might have created expectations on the friend's part. Even if it was a mutual agreement initially, stopping suddenly could leave the friend feeling rejected or used. The author's argument is that there was no romantic intent, but the friend's feelings aren't just about romance\u2014they could feel disrespected or undervalued. \n\nThe other sub users said it's the author's fault for leading on, which makes sense if the friend expected more. The author might not have realized the emotional impact. However, the author did stop the arrangement in a respectful way. The friend's reaction is valid, but does that make the author at fault? \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes). The author might not have intended to lead on, but the sexual relationship could have created unspoken expectations. Even if it was mutual, ending it abruptly without considering the friend's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend's hurt is real, and the author's actions, while not malicious, may have disregarded the friend's emotional state. So, the author is in the wrong for not being more empathetic during the end of the arrangement.\n"
