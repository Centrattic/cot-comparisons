I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy. He has a gay friend who offered him a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this a few times over weeks or months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated, but felt guilty and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is cold and distant, leading the author to question if he's at fault.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement. The author made it clear he's not into men in a romantic way, just the physical act. But when the author's girlfriend left, they resumed. Then the author tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable and ended things. The friend's reaction is now causing tension.\n\nThe author is confused because he thought he was clear about his boundaries. However, even if there was mutual consent at the start, the ongoing dynamic might have become emotionally complicated. The friend might have developed feelings or felt used, especially when the author reciprocated but then stopped. The author's actions could have led the friend to believe there was a chance for something more, especially after rekindling the arrangement post-breakup.\n\nThe author's main defense is that he was clear about his straight identity. However, the friend's perspective is important. If the friend felt that the author was leading him on, even unintentionally, that could be the issue. The fact that the author stopped after reciprocating might have left the friend feeling rejected or hurt. The author's attempts to reach out were met with coldness, which suggests the friend is upset.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, the author might be at fault for not managing the friend's expectations. Even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the situation could have created emotional complications. The friend might have invested more emotionally, leading to hurt feelings when the author ended it. The author should consider that their actions, while consensual, might have crossed a line in terms of friendship and mutual respect.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact on the friend and for not maintaining clear boundaries throughout the relationship. The friend's reaction is a valid response to feeling used or rejected. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
