I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author agreed. They continued this for weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the activity. The author later felt bad and decided to reciprocate by sucking the friend but immediately regretted it, told the friend to stop, and now the friend is distant. The author is confused because others say it's their fault for leading the friend on, but they thought it was clear they were straight.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author and friend had an arrangement where the friend was providing oral sex, which might be okay if both parties were comfortable. However, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is good. But after the breakup, they resumed, which could be problematic because maybe the friend had different expectations after the breakup. \n\nThen the author tried to reciprocate, which the friend might have seen as a sign of changing the dynamic, but the author then backed out. This could have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the cold response. The friend might feel used or that the author wasn't honest about their intentions all along. \n\nThe author claims they were clear they're straight and not interested romantically, but maybe the actions (like resuming the activity after the breakup and then trying to reciprocate) sent mixed signals. The friend might have felt that the author was exploiting their friendship for sexual favors without any emotional reciprocity, and when the author tried to reverse roles, it made the friend feel uncomfortable or disrespected.\n\nAlso, the author might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend. Even if both agreed initially, stopping after reciprocation and causing distance could be a breach of trust. The friend's withdrawal suggests they felt hurt, which the author might have contributed to by not maintaining consistent boundaries.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about mutual respect. If the author wasn't interested in a reciprocal or romantic relationship but continued the arrangement, and then changed their behavior, it's possible they led the friend on without being upfront about their limits from the start. The friend might have had expectations that weren't met, leading to the fallout.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author thought they were clear about being straight, the actions might have created a situation where the friend felt used or confused. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop could have been the tipping point. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not maintaining clear boundaries throughout and for causing emotional distress to the friend.\n"
