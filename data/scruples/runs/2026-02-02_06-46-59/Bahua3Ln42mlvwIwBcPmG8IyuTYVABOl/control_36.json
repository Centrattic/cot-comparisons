I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight guy who's a bit heteroflexible. His gay friend offered to give him a blowjob, and he agreed. They did this a few times over weeks or months. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, and the friend was okay with it. After the girlfriend dumped the author, they resumed the oral sex again. Later, the author felt bad because the friend was always giving and not receiving, so he reciprocated, but felt awful afterward and told the friend they should stop. Now, the friend has become distant and unresponsive, leading the author to question if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, boundaries, and the nature of their relationship. The author claims he was clear about his straightness and didn't lead the friend on. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author went along. However, when the friend's emotions were hurt, the author tried to end it, but the friend is now upset.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions crossed any lines. Since both are 18, there's no legal age issue. The author didn't force the friend; the friend offered, and the author accepted. But the ongoing nature of the arrangement might have created emotional expectations the author didn't meet. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have caused hurt feelings, even if done kindly. The friend's reaction suggests that the emotional aspect was significant, possibly leading to the friend feeling used or unappreciated.\n\nThe author's friends say he led the friend on, but he claims he was clear about his orientation. However, the friend might have developed feelings beyond just physical activity, which the author didn't reciprocate. The author's main issue is now feeling responsible for the friend's hurt feelings, even though he tried to end things amicably.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author didn't force anything, but engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend can create complex dynamics. If the friend felt the relationship was mutual in a more emotional sense, the author might have been unaware of those expectations. The fact that the friend is now avoiding the author suggests that the author's actions, while not malicious, may have caused harm. The author's responsibility here could be in not recognizing the emotional implications of their actions and then not maintaining the connection after the sexual relationship ended.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong not because of the act itself, but for not acknowledging the emotional impact on the friend and then not making an effort to maintain the friendship despite the friend's withdrawal. However, the friend's reaction is also a factor. But since the question is about the author's responsibility, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because he contributed to the situation by entering into a sexual arrangement that had emotional consequences he didn't fully manage.\n"
