I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered to give him a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this a few times over weeks or months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. Later, when the author was dumped, they resumed the activity. The author then tried reciprocating but felt bad and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and communication. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement. The author made it clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend was okay with this. The problem arises when the author starts feeling guilty and ends the arrangement. The friend becomes upset and distant. \n\nNow, the author is being criticized for \"leading him on,\" but he claims he never intended to give false hope. The friends were clear about their boundaries. However, the act of engaging in sexual activity, even with clear boundaries, can sometimes create emotional attachment or expectations that one party might not anticipate. The author might not have considered how the friend felt emotionally after the arrangement ended. \n\nAlso, when the author tried to reciprocate, he felt sick and ended it, which could have been confusing or hurtful to the friend. Maybe the friend felt used or that the author was taking advantage. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friend might have developed feelings or felt a sense of obligation.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The author was in a position where he accepted the friend's advances but later stopped reciprocating, leading to an imbalance that the friend might have found uncomfortable. The friend might have felt that the relationship was one-sided, especially after the author ended it.\n\nThe author's actions might have caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally. The friend's reaction\u2014being cold and distant\u2014suggests that the author's decisions affected their friendship negatively. Even with clear communication, the act of engaging in such a private and intimate activity can create unspoken expectations that aren't met when the arrangement ends.\n\nHowever, the author did try to communicate his feelings and ended the arrangement when he felt uncomfortable. He also made an effort to reach out after, which the friend didn't respond to. The question is whether the author's actions, while not malicious, still crossed a line by the friend's standards.\n\nIn relationships, even platonic or casual, mutual respect and understanding are crucial. The author might be in the wrong if his actions, despite his intentions, caused harm to their friendship. The friend's withdrawal could be a reaction to feeling used or unappreciated. Even if there was consent initially, the ongoing dynamic might have created emotional baggage that the author didn't foresee.\n\nOn the other hand, if both parties were clear and the friend understood the terms from the start, the author might not be entirely at fault. But the fact that the friend became distant suggests that the author's actions had unintended consequences. It's possible that the author didn't consider the emotional impact of ending the arrangement, leading to the friend feeling rejected or devalued.\n\nIn summary, while the author communicated his boundaries, the actions of engaging in the activity and then stopping might have caused emotional harm. The friend's reaction indicates that the author's decisions affected their friendship, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering the emotional aspects and the potential for the friend to feel used or hurt when the arrangement ended.\n"
