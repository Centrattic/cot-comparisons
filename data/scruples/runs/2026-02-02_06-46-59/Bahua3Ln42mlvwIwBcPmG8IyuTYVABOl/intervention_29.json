I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a straight, heteroflexible guy. He had a gay friend who offered a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this a few times over weeks or months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the author felt bad because the friend was always giving and he sucked him once, which made him feel awful. He told the friend they should stop. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clear he's not into the friend romantically. The friend is gay, and he initiated the sexual activity. The author didn't push for anything else beyond the blowjobs. However, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows he understood the boundaries when in a relationship. But after the breakup, they resumed. The key issue here is whether the author's actions led the friend on or created false expectations.\n\nThe friend might have felt that the author was reciprocating in some way, especially when the author sucked him once. The author then stopped, which might have hurt the friend's feelings or made him feel used. The friend's coldness could be a reaction to feeling rejected or unappreciated. The author claims he was clear about being straight and not wanting a romantic or physical relationship beyond the blowjobs, but the friend might have hoped for more or felt that the author's actions were a form of reciprocation or emotional connection.\n\nThe people in the other sub said the author led him on, which the author disputes. But maybe the issue is that even though the author didn't have romantic intentions, the act of reciprocal oral sex (sucking him once) might have crossed a line in the friend's mind, leading to confusion or hurt feelings. The author then stopped, which the friend might interpret as rejection. The friend's response (being distant) is typical when someone feels emotionally hurt or used.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because even if he didn't mean to lead the friend on, the actions could have been perceived that way. The friend is gay and might have had emotional or romantic hopes, even if unspoken. The author's initial acceptance of the blowjobs and then reciprocal action, even if brief, might have given the friend a false sense of mutual interest or reciprocation. Additionally, the author's girlfriend's breakup allowed them to resume, which might not be a healthy boundary, as the friend might have been using the author to cope with his own loneliness or unrequited feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions could be seen as consensual and without coercion. They were both adults (18), and the author was honest about his heterosexuality. However, the problem might be the emotional aspect. The friend might have developed feelings or felt that the author was manipulating the situation, even if unintentionally. The key is whether the author was aware of the potential for emotional harm and still proceeded in a way that could be hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, the situation could be seen as leading the friend on by engaging in sexual acts that the friend might have interpreted as reciprocation or a deeper connection, leading to hurt feelings when it ended. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not fully considering the friend's emotional state and for maintaining a dynamic that could be harmful to the friendship.\n"
