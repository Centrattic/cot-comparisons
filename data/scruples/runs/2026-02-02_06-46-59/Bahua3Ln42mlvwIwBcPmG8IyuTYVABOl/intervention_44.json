I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They continued this over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated by performing oral on the friend but then regretted it and told the friend to stop. Now, the friend is cold and distant, and the author is confused because others said he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and communication. The author and friend agreed to a sexual arrangement, but when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which seems respectful. After the breakup, they resumed. The problem arises when the author reciprocated, which made him feel bad, and then he ended things. The friend is now upset.\n\nBut the author is described as heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to some same-sex experiences but not a preference. The friend is gay, so he's likely seeking emotional and physical connection. The author's actions might have given false hope. Even if the author never intended a romantic relationship, engaging in sexual acts can imply more than just physical, especially if one party is emotionally invested. When the author reciprocated, maybe the friend felt more connected, leading to emotional hurt when it ended. The author didn't communicate boundaries clearly, leading the friend to believe there was a deeper connection. Even if it was a mutual understanding, the sudden end and the friend's reaction suggest that the author's actions caused emotional harm. The author should have maintained clear boundaries from the start to avoid leading the friend on. So, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't set clear expectations and his actions might have given the friend hope for a relationship that wasn't possible. Answer A.\n"
