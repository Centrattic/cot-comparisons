I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where he had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. \n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male. He had a close friend who is gay and offered him blowjobs. They engaged in this for a while. Then the author got a girlfriend, which stopped the arrangement. After the breakup, they resumed the sexual activity. Later, the author tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement again. Now, the friend is cold and distant, and the author is confused about why he's being blamed.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author didn't enter into a romantic or emotional relationship but had a sexual arrangement. The issue might be about consent and boundaries. When the author had a girlfriend, he stopped, which is good. But after the breakup, resuming with the friend might have crossed some lines. The friend is gay, so maybe the dynamic is different. The author might have been using the friend for sex without considering the emotional impact. Also, after ending the arrangement, the author tried to explain it nicely, but the friend is still upset. People in the sub said it's the author's fault for leading him on. The author's defense is that he was clear about his straightness and didn't want anything romantic. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the author didn't consider the friend's feelings. Even if it's just sexual, the friend might have developed emotional attachment. The author might have been okay with the arrangement but the friend didn't. Also, when the author reciprocated, he felt sick, which suggests he didn't want the relationship to be mutual, which could hurt the friend. The author might have been inconsistent in communication, leading the friend to hope for something more. \n\nThe author is now trying to reconnect, but the friend is ignoring him. The author's friends say to leave him alone, but he doesn't want to lose the friendship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author was honest about his orientation and boundaries, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend, even if non-romantic, can lead to emotional harm if not navigated carefully. The fact that the friend is gay might mean he was seeking more than just a sexual encounter, perhaps. The author's actions could have been emotionally exploitative, even if not intended. \n\nThe author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have hurt the friend's feelings, especially if the friend felt rejected. The key here is whether the author respected the friend's emotional needs. Even if the author was clear, the friend might have felt used. The author might have not communicated effectively, leading to the friend's hurt feelings. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not considering the emotional impact and for not maintaining consistent communication. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he may have engaged in a one-sided relationship that hurt his friend, even if unintentionally.\n"
