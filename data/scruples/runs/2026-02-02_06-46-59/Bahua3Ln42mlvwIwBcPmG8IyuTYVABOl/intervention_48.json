I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a heterosexual-identified person engaging in sexual acts with a gay friend, then ending it, which leads to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is straight but identifies as heteroflexible. He had a close friend who is gay and offered oral sex, which he accepted. They did this a few times until he got a girlfriend, then resumed after the girlfriend dumped him. When he tried reciprocating, he felt bad and ended the arrangement, leading to the friend being cold. The author is confused because he thought the friend understood he wasn't interested romantically, but the friend seems hurt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, the friend's feelings might matter here. Even if there was no romantic implication, engaging in sexual acts with a friend can have emotional consequences. The friend might have developed feelings or felt used, even if the author didn't intend to. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have confused the friend. Also, the author's friend might have felt the relationship was more meaningful than just a sexual arrangement. The initial acceptance of the sexual acts could have led the friend to believe there was mutual affection or a deeper connection. When the author ended it, it might have hurt the friend's feelings, even if the author was clear about not wanting a romantic relationship. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional impact on his friend. Even if it was a consensual arrangement, the friend's feelings were not respected when the author ended it abruptly. The author's friend might have felt rejected or unappreciated, leading to the cold response. The key issue here is communication and mutual understanding. The author thought he was clear about his intentions, but the friend's reaction suggests there was a miscommunication or unmet emotional needs. The author's actions, while consensual, might have caused emotional harm, making him at fault for not being more considerate of his friend's feelings.\n"
