I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They did this a few times over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed the BJ stuff. Later, the author felt bad, reciprocated the oral sex once, then told his friend to stop, explaining it's not what he is. The friend has since become distant and cold. The author is wondering if he's the bad guy here.\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The author didn't mislead the friend about his sexuality from the start, as he stated he's straight. However, the friend might have had different expectations or felt that the relationship crossed a line. The author ended the arrangement when he felt uncomfortable, which could be seen as respecting his own boundaries. However, the friend's feelings being hurt and the resulting estrangement is a consequence. \n\nIn relationships, even if there's no romantic intent, mutual respect and consent are important. The author might have overstepped by continuing the arrangement after getting a girlfriend, then breaking it off again. Also, the fact that the friend is gay might mean he had deeper emotional feelings, even if the author didn't. The author's actions, while perhaps honest about his sexuality, might have led the friend to feel used or unappreciated. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful of the friend's boundaries and feelings. Even if the author didn't intend to lead him on, the friend's perspective matters. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact, even if he was clear about his intentions. So, the answer could be A. But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author tried to explain and apologize, but the friend's reaction is still significant. Maybe the answer is A because the author engaged in a sexual relationship with a friend, which could have been harmful even if unintentional.\n"
