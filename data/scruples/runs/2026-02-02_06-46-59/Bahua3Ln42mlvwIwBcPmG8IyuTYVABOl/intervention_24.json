I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. They engaged in oral sex for a while when the author was single. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the activity. The author then felt bad about the power dynamics and reciprocated, but immediately regretted it and told his friend they should stop. Now the friend is cold and distant, and others say the author led him on.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement when the author was single. However, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which shows some respect for the friend's feelings. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. The problem arises when the author reciprocates, which might have made the friend feel used or unappreciated. Even though the author tried to communicate that they wanted to stop, the friend's reaction suggests feeling hurt. \n\nOthers think the author led him on, but the author claims there was no romantic intent. However, the act of reciprocation could be seen as crossing a line, making the friend feel like the relationship was more than just a mutual agreement. The friend might have felt that the author was treating the relationship as transactional or not respecting his feelings. \n\nThe author's actions, while consensual, may have caused emotional harm. Even if there was no initial deception, the ongoing dynamic might have created confusion or unmet expectations. The friend's withdrawal suggests he felt hurt or manipulated, which the author might be responsible for, even if unintentionally. \n\nSo, considering emotional impact and maintaining healthy boundaries, the author might be at fault for not foreseeing the friend's feelings and not handling the situation more sensitively after reciprocating.\n"
