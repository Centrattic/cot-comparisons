I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The setup is that a straight guy engages in sexual activity with his gay friend, then later stops, causing the friend to become distant.\n\nFirst, the author mentions he's heteroflexible. He had a sexual relationship with his gay friend when he was single, which he later stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed the activity, but the author felt uncomfortable and ended it. Now the friend is acting cold.\n\nI need to consider consent and mutual understanding. The author claims it was clear he's not interested in a romantic relationship, just physical contact. The friend is gay, so maybe he had different expectations? But the author didn't reciprocate romantically. The friend might have hoped for more, but the author only wanted casual sex. \n\nThe author stopped the activity after feeling bad, which was his choice. However, ending the sexual relationship could have emotional consequences, especially if the friend was emotionally invested. The author might not have considered the friend's feelings when ending it, even if the friend was just using him for sex. \n\nAlso, the friend becoming distant might be a reaction to rejection. If the friend was only interested in the author for sex and not as a friend, then the distance makes sense. But if they were close friends, the author's actions might have hurt the friend. \n\nThe author tried to reach out but got a cold response. The friend's actions suggest he's upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author was honest about his intentions from the start and didn't lead the friend on, maybe he's not at fault. But if there's a breach of trust or emotional harm, maybe he is. \n\nThe key points are consent, honesty, and mutual understanding. The author was clear about his sexuality and didn't promise anything. The friend might have misread the situation, but the author didn't deceive him. So the author might not be in the wrong. But ending the relationship abruptly could be seen as hurtful. \n\nIn conclusion, since the author was upfront about his intentions and the friend might have had unrealistic expectations, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the emotional fallout is a result of both parties' actions. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
