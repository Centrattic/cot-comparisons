I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the situation involves a straight guy who had a friend offer him blowjobs. They had this arrangement for a while, then when he had a girlfriend, they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. The guy then tried to reciprocate but felt bad and stopped. Now his friend is upset and distant, and he's wondering if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are consent, communication, and boundaries. The author says they were clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a relationship or kissing. But maybe the friend had different expectations? If the friend is gay, maybe he saw this as a way to be intimate without a romantic commitment. However, when the author reciprocated and then pulled away, that might have caused confusion or hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped the arrangement, which was good. But after the breakup, resuming it might have reopened old dynamics. The author then tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable, which led to ending the relationship. The friend's reaction being cold and distant is a problem, but the author is concerned about losing a friend.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and the author accepted. There was no forced interaction; it was mutual. The author did communicate his boundaries when he felt uncomfortable. So maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the ongoing issue is whether the author's actions led the friend to expect something more than what was offered. If the friend felt emotionally hurt because the author didn't reciprocate in a romantic way, that's a different aspect.\n\nBut the author maintained that it was purely physical, and when he felt it was no longer okay, he stopped. The friend's reaction might be more about unmet emotional expectations rather than the author's fault. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any exploitation or lack of communication. Since there was consent and boundaries were set, the author might not be at fault. The friend's coldness is his own issue, perhaps not the author's responsibility.\n"
