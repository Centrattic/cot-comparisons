I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when he was single, stopped when he had a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. The guy later felt uncomfortable with the reciprocity and ended it, leading to the friend being cold. The author is confused about whether he's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Both parties initially agreed to the arrangement, so there's no coercion. The author was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship, so that's important. However, when he later reciprocated and then ended the arrangement, maybe the friend felt betrayed or used. The author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was a mutual understanding or expectation beyond just the sexual aspect. \n\nBut the author did try to communicate his discomfort and ended it politely. The friend's reaction might be about feeling rejected or not respected. The key points are whether the author was honest about his intentions and if he ended things in a respectful way. Since he did, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But some might argue that even with consent, the dynamic could be emotionally hurtful if the friend had unspoken expectations. \n\nAlso, the age is 18, so they're young, and misunderstandings can happen. The author's friends in the sub said it's his fault for leading on, but he claims it was clear from the start. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So the answer might be B, but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the ongoing arrangement led to emotional dependency, making the author responsible for ending it abruptly. But he did apologize and tried to reconnect. Hmm. Maybe A, but I'm not sure. Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Let me check again. The author was honest, ended it politely, but the friend's hurt feelings might be valid. So it's possible the author is in the wrong for the ongoing arrangement leading to emotional harm. So maybe A. But others might say it's mutual and the author isn't at fault. I'm a bit conflicted here. The key is whether the author's actions were deceptive or not. He was upfront about his orientation, so maybe B is correct. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
