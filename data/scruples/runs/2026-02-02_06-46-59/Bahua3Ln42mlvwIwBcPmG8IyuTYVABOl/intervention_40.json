I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a specific situation. The scenario involves a straight male student who had a friend offer to perform oral sex, and they engaged in it multiple times over weeks/months. Then the student got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed, but when the author reciprocated, he felt bad and ended it. The friend became distant, leading the author to question his actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements. The author is described as \"heteroflexible,\" which might imply some openness to same-sex activities, but he later clarifies he's straight. The friend is gay. They had a non-consensual or unspoken agreement? The author's actions might be seen as using the friend for sex without a clear understanding of boundaries. Even if the author thought it was okay, the friend might have developed feelings, leading to the cold treatment.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. The author ended the arrangement but caused emotional harm. The friend's reaction suggests he felt used or hurt. The author didn't consider the friend's emotional investment, even if it wasn't romantic. The key issue here is whether the author respected the friend's feelings and boundaries. Since the friend was gay, maybe he saw this as a way to have intimacy, but the author's actions led to a betrayal of trust when the friendship changed. The author's decision to reciprocate but then stop could have been confusing or hurtful. The author should have communicated better and perhaps recognized the potential emotional impact from the start. So, even if there was no explicit leading on, the actions might have still caused harm unintentionally. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
