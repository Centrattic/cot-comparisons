I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving a gay friend offering and then receiving blowjobs, and then cutting things off. \n\nFirst, the author is straight but heteroflexible. He had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend when he was single. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the activity. The author felt guilty, returned the favor once but felt awful and ended things. Now the friend is distant, and others say the author led him on.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author claims it was clear from the start he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. But engaging in sexual acts can be confusing for the other person, even if there's no romantic intent. The friend might have thought there was mutual interest or a reciprocal arrangement. When the author stopped, maybe the friend felt rejected or manipulated, leading to the cold treatment.\n\nThe author says they were best friends and did things together before. The friend's reaction might be hurt or angry because the sexual relationship ended, especially since the author had previously resumed it after the breakup. Ending the sexual part might have affected their friendship, but the author might not have considered the friend's feelings enough. Also, the author's initial acceptance of the sexual acts could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintended. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author did communicate his feelings when he stopped, but the ongoing sexual relationship might have given the friend hope for something more or reciprocal. The author might not have been wrong in ending it, but maybe could have handled it more sensitively to maintain the friendship. However, the friend's reaction seems harsh. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a responsibility to consider the friend's feelings. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author acted based on his own boundaries and communicated them, maybe the answer is B.\n"
