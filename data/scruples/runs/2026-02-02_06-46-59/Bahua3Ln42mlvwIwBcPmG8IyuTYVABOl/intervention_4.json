I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight man who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Now the friend is acting distant, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means he's primarily straight but might be open to some same-sex experiences. The friend is gay, so he's likely interested in the author in a romantic way. The author accepted the friend's offers for blowjobs, which is a one-sided sexual arrangement since the friend is giving and the author is receiving. When the author's girlfriend dumps him, they resume the arrangement. But after reciprocating once, the author feels uncomfortable and ends it, leading to the friend being upset.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend might have seen this as a form of intimacy, not just casual sex. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's affection for him, even if there's no romantic intent. The friend might feel used or that his feelings (however unspoken) were disregarded when the author stopped the arrangement. \n\nEven if the author didn't lead on with promises, the ongoing sexual relationship might have created emotional expectations on the friend's part. The author's decision to stop, after reciprocating once, might have hurt the friend's pride or made him feel rejected. The author's responsibility here is to acknowledge that the friend's actions might be based on deeper feelings, and ending the arrangement without considering the emotional impact could be seen as the author's fault. \n\nSo, while there's no malicious intent, the author didn't manage the situation with enough consideration for the friend's possible emotional state. Hence, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
