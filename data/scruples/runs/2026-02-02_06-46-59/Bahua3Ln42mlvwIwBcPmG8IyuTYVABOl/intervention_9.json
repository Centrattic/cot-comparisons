I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when the author was single and then resumed after a breakup. The author felt bad about the power dynamic, tried to reciprocate, but found it uncomfortable and ended things. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused about their role in the fallout.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and communication. The author mentioned that they were clear about their sexual orientation and that there was no expectation of a romantic relationship. However, the act of engaging in sexual activity, even if consensual, can have emotional consequences. The friend, being gay, might have had different expectations or feelings about the arrangement. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have caused confusion or hurt feelings, even if they were clear initially.\n\nThe author's actions might not have been malicious, but they may have overlooked the emotional impact on their friend. The friend's cold response suggests that the author's actions affected their friend's feelings, possibly leading to insecurity or unmet expectations. The author's attempt to maintain the friendship while ending the sexual aspect might have been abrupt or not handled with enough sensitivity.\n\nIn terms of consent, both parties agreed to the arrangement, so there's no issue there. However, the author's subsequent change in behavior (stopping after reciprocating) could have been a misstep in maintaining clear boundaries. Even if the author is straight, the act of reciprocation might have given the friend hope for a more balanced or reciprocal relationship, which the author then rejected. This could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author's friends in the sub said it's their fault for leading on, which makes sense because the dynamic shifted when they tried to reciprocate. The friend might have felt that the author was insincere in the initial agreement or that the author's actions were inconsistent with their stated boundaries. The author's responsibility here is to recognize that their actions, even if consensual, could have emotional repercussions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while not malicious, might have been inconsiderate of their friend's feelings. They might have created a situation where the friend felt used or unappreciated, especially after reciprocating. Even if the author was clear about their sexuality, the emotional impact on the friend is still valid. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not fully considering how their actions affected their friend's emotions and for not handling the cessation of the arrangement with more empathy.\n"
