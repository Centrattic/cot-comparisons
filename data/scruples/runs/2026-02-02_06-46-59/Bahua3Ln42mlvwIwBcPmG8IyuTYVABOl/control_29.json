I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They started when he was single, stopped when he got a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. The author tried reciprocating once but felt uncomfortable and ended things. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused about their friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was clear about being straight from the start. The friend initiated the sexual activity, so maybe the friend understood the boundaries. However, the author's action of reciprocating once might have made the friend feel the relationship changed, leading to hurt feelings when it was stopped. The author tried to communicate the end of the arrangement, which seems honest. The friend's reaction is coldness, which is a personal response. The key points are consent and communication. The author didn't force anything and was upfront about his orientation. The friend might have had unmet expectations, but the author isn't obligated to maintain the relationship if he's not comfortable. However, it's possible the friend felt rejected or used. The author might be in a gray area because while he wasn't physically wrong, emotionally he might have hurt a friend. But since he communicated his boundaries and acted on his feelings, maybe he's not entirely at fault. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author tried to be honest and stop the behavior when he felt it wasn't right. The friend's reaction is their own issue, and the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's causing him discomfort. However, there's a nuance here where the author's actions could have been misinterpreted. But overall, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n"
