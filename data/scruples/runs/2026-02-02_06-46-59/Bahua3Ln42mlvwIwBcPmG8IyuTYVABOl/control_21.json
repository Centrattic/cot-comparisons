I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The key points here are consent, communication, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nFirst, the initial part where the author accepted the offer for oral sex. Both are 18, so legally adults, and if both consented, that's not inherently wrong. But the dynamic here might be tricky because the friend is gay, so the author is engaging in a sexual act with someone who's in a same-sex relationship. The author mentions being \"heteroflexible,\" which might mean he's open to same-sex encounters but not into it. \n\nThen, when the author gets a girlfriend, they stop. That seems like a responsible decision. But when the girlfriend dumps him, they resume. Here's where it gets complicated. The author might have given the friend the impression that it's okay to continue, but when the author ends it, the friend feels betrayed or used. The author then tried to reciprocate, but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. \n\nThe friend's reaction of becoming cold and distant is a sign of hurt. The author's communication was \"nice,\" but maybe not clear enough. The friend might have felt rejected or that the author was leading him on. Even if the author didn't intend to lead him on, the actions could be seen as inconsistent. The author might have created an expectation of ongoing sexual activity that wasn't met, leading to the friend's emotional response.\n\nThe author is confused because he thought he was clear about his boundaries. However, in relationships, especially friendships, actions can speak louder than words. The friend might have invested emotionally or romantically, even if the author didn't. The author's decision to stop might have felt like a rejection, which is hurtful. \n\nThe advice from others that it's the author's fault for leading on makes sense in that the author didn't maintain consistent boundaries. Starting and stopping the arrangement based on his relationship status might have confused the friend. Also, the author's attempt to reciprocate was awkward and led to immediate regret, which might have made the friend feel undervalued or used.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for not setting clear and consistent boundaries from the start, leading the friend to feel used or rejected when the author ended the arrangement. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
