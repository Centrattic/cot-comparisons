I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and he accepted because he was single and horny. Then they did it multiple times over weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. The girlfriend dumped him, and they started again. Later, the author felt bad and reciprocated by sucking the friend, but then felt awful and told him to stop. Now the friend is cold, and the author is confused if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, mutual understanding, and boundaries. The author says they were clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend initiated the acts, and the author agreed each time. However, when the author stopped, the friend became distant. The author is now wondering if he's at fault for leading the friend on.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's actions were exploitative. Since both were adults (18 years old), and there was consent, maybe there's no legal wrong. But ethically, the question is about emotional manipulation. The author knew he wasn't in a romantic relationship and the friend might have developed feelings. The act of reciprocating (sucking him) and then stopping could have caused hurt feelings. The author might have led the friend to believe there was more potential for a relationship, even though he was clear he's straight. The friend's coldness suggests he felt used or rejected.\n\nThe user mentions that others said it's the author's fault for leading him on. The author argues he didn't lead him on and was clear about his orientation. But actions can speak louder than words. Even if the author was clear, the ongoing sexual activity might have given the friend false hope. When the author reciprocated, it might have made the friend feel there was mutual interest beyond just physical acts.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to stop without considering the emotional impact on the friend could be seen as abrupt. The friend's reaction is understandable if he felt the relationship was more personal. The author might be in the wrong for not managing the friend's expectations better and for not being sensitive to the friend's feelings when ending the arrangement.\n\nBut since both were adults and the acts were consensual, some might argue it's not the author's fault. However, the ethical aspect of emotional harm is a gray area. The author's actions, while not necessarily illegal, might be considered inconsiderate. The friend's feelings were hurt, and the author's responsibility includes considering how his actions affect others, even if he's clear about his intentions.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he might have contributed to the friend's emotional distress by engaging in a sexual relationship that the friend could have interpreted as more meaningful, and then abruptly ending it without addressing the emotional implications.\n"
