I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the details.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is straight but describes himself as heteroflexible, which I think means he's mostly into women but open to same-sex experiences. His gay friend offered oral sex, and he agreed. They did this a few times over weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the relationship ended, they resumed. Later, the author tried reciprocating but felt bad and ended things, leading to the friend being cold.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship ethics perspective, consent and communication are key. The author says it was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. However, the friend might have had different expectations, especially if he's gay and might have felt there was a possibility of something more. \n\nThe author did end things when he felt uncomfortable, which is responsible. But the ongoing friendship and the friend's reaction suggest there might be emotional attachment or unmet expectations on the friend's part. Even if the author was clear about his orientation, the act of engaging in sexual activities could have led the friend to believe there was more potential. \n\nAlso, the author resumed the activity after the girlfriend broke up, which might have given the friend hope or a sense of security that was later shattered when the author decided to stop. The friend's hurt feelings and withdrawal are a natural response to feeling used or having their feelings disregarded, even if there was no explicit commitment. \n\nWhile the author did communicate his boundaries and ended things amicably, the initial arrangement might have been ambiguous. The friend's perspective is important here. If he felt led on, even unintentionally, the author could be seen as responsible for not maintaining clear boundaries from the start. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author didn't intend to lead on, the actions might have caused harm. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong.\n"
