I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving a gay friend offering and performing oral sex, then stopping when the author gets a girlfriend, and then resuming after the breakup. The author then reciprocates once but stops, leading to a cold response from the friend. \n\nFirst, the author is described as straight but heteroflexible. The friend is gay. They had an arrangement where the friend performed oral sex on the author. Then the author dates someone, they stop, and after a breakup, they resume. The author then reciprocates once, feels bad, and stops. The friend becomes distant.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Initially, the arrangement was consensual, but when the author gets a girlfriend, they stop, which is responsible. Then after the breakup, they resume. The author later reciprocates, which might have been a mistake if the friend didn't expect it. The author then stops again, which the friend took as rejection, leading to the cold response.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author led the friend on. The author claims it was clear they're straight and not interested romantically. However, the friend might have felt emotionally involved or hoped for more. The act of reciprocating might have given false hope. Even if the author is straight, the friend could feel used or unappreciated when the author stops reciprocating. The author's actions, while consensual, might have caused emotional harm. The friend's distance is a reaction to being rejected. The author might not be in the wrong legally or ethically if there was no deception, but socially and emotionally, they might have mishandled the situation. The fact that they tried to apologize and explain suggests they care, but the friend's feelings are valid. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings and may have contributed to the emotional distress by starting and stopping the arrangement.\n"
