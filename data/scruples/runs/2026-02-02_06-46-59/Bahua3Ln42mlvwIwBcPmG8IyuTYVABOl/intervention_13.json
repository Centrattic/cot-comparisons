I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a straight man who's having a sexual relationship with a gay friend, then things change when he gets a girlfriend, they stop, then resume after a breakup. The key points are about consent, communication, and the impact on the friendship.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to same-sex experiences but not exclusively gay. The friend is gay and initiated the oral sex situation. The author accepted it initially, which might be consensual. But when the author later reciprocated, he felt uncomfortable and ended it. The friend became distant, leading to the author feeling confused and seeking validation.\n\nThe main issues here are trust and emotional boundaries. The author had a girlfriend at one point, which might have been a breach of trust if the friend knew. Then, after breaking up, they resumed the arrangement. When the author tried to reciprocate, he felt it was wrong, which could be a sign of mixed signals or not being fully comfortable with his own orientation. Ending the relationship might have hurt the friend's feelings, especially since the friend is gay and might have had deeper emotional attachments than the author anticipated.\n\nThe author claims he was clear about not being interested in a romantic relationship, but actions can sometimes speak louder than words. The friend might have felt used or led on, especially after the author reciprocated and then stopped. The author's friend's cold reaction suggests he felt hurt, which the author might not have considered. The advice from others that the author led him on makes sense because even if there was no romantic intent, the sexual relationship could have created emotional expectations.\n\nAlso, the age factor (both 18) might play a role in their maturity and understanding of boundaries. The author might not have fully considered the emotional impact on his friend, leading to a breakdown in their friendship. So, while the initial arrangement might have been consensual, the way it ended, including the author's reciprocation and subsequent rejection, likely hurt the friend. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not being honest about his feelings and the potential for causing emotional harm.\n"
