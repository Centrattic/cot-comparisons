I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. They started a sexual arrangement where the friend gave him blowjobs. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. After the relationship ended, they resumed the activity. The author later reciprocated by performing oral on the friend but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because others say they led the friend on, but they claim it was clear they weren't interested romantically.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author and the friend had an understanding from the start that it was a sexual arrangement without emotional commitment. However, when the author reciprocated, it might have confused the friend's feelings. The key points to consider are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. The author ended the arrangement, which might have felt abrupt to the friend, causing hurt feelings. Even if the author didn't lead on, the termination of the arrangement without addressing the friend's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the author's actions might have made the friend feel used or devalued, especially after the friend invested emotionally. The author's responsibility includes considering how their actions affect the friend, even if there was no romantic intent. So, even if the author isn't in the wrong in a legal or moral sense, the impact on the friend's emotions makes the author at least partially responsible for the rift. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
