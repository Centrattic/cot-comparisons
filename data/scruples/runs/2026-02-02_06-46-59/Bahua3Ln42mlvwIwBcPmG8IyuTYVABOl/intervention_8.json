I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a straight man engaging in a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ending it which caused the friend to become distant.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is heteroflexible, which means he's attracted to both men and women. His friend is gay and offered oral sex, which the author accepted. They continued this for some time, then stopped when the author had a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, then the author decided to reciprocate but felt bad and ended the arrangement. The friend became cold, and the author is now feeling responsible but confused.\n\nThe author's actions led to the friend feeling used or led on. Even though the author claims it was clear he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship, the friend might have interpreted the sexual relationship as a form of emotional connection or hope for more. When the author ended it, especially after reciprocating and then deciding it wasn't right, it could have been hurtful. The friend's response (being distant, short replies) suggests he felt rejected or unappreciated. \n\nThe author might not have explicitly said it was just physical, but in any relationship, especially with a friend, there's an expectation of mutual respect. By engaging in a sexual dynamic and then ending it, the author could have caused emotional harm. Even if it was consensual, the friend's feelings and boundaries might not have been considered. The author's friends in the sub also pointed out leading him on, which the author denies, but the friend's reaction implies otherwise.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to lead the friend on, the actions did create a situation where the friend felt used. The author's responsibility lies in considering the emotional impact of their actions, even if it was a physical arrangement. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
