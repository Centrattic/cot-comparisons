I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The guy was single and accepted a blowjob from his friend. Later, he got a girlfriend and they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Then he felt guilty and stopped again, leading to the friend being upset.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and emotional impact. The user claims he's straight and never led the friend on, but the friend might have felt more attached. The user ended the arrangement abruptly, which could have hurt the friend's feelings, even if there was no romantic intent.\n\nThe friends were close, doing a lot together, so the sexual relationship might have created a dependency or unmet expectations for the gay friend. Even if the user didn't lead him on, the act of ending the relationship could be seen as a betrayal, especially if the friend felt it was a mutual but unspoken arrangement.\n\nThe user's argument is that he was clear about being straight, so he didn't lead on. But maybe the friend felt a sense of closeness beyond just the sexual aspect. The user's guilt and attempts to communicate were there, but the friend's reaction is a result of the user's actions. The user is now struggling with losing the friendship.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complex. The initial actions were consensual between two adults. However, when the user ended it, especially after the girlfriend left, it might have been a sensitive time for the friend. The user might not be in the wrong morally, but his actions did cause harm. The friend's reaction is valid, but the user has to consider the impact of his decisions on others.\n\nThe advice from others said it's his fault for leading on, but he claims it wasn't. The question is whether the user had the right to end the arrangement without considering the friend's feelings. Since they were close friends, the user's decision to stop might have been abrupt, even if it was necessary for his own ethics.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user didn't act with malicious intent, his actions did affect his friend. The friend's feelings are valid, but the user's actions might not be in the wrong as he was honest about his orientation. However, the way he ended the relationship could be seen as insensitive. The answer might be a mix, but according to the options, either A or B. Given the context, the user isn't in the wrong, but there's room for B. However, some might argue A because leading on a friend, even if unintentionally, could be seen as wrong. But given the user's clear communication, maybe B is better. Hmm.\n"
