I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves him accepting oral sex from a gay friend, then later when he gets a girlfriend, they stop. After the breakup, they resume the activity, and then the user stops after reciprocating once. Now the friend is upset and distant.\n\nFirst, the user is heteroflexible, which means he might be open to some same-sex interactions but isn't exclusively gay. The friend is gay, so he's likely seeking emotional and physical connection, maybe even romantic feelings. The user's initial acceptance of the oral sex might have led the friend to believe there was some mutual interest or a deeper connection. \n\nWhen the user starts dating someone, they stop, which the friend accepts. But after the breakup, they resume the activity. Then the user reciprocates once but feels bad and tells the friend to stop. The friend becomes cold, and the user feels confused because he thought he was clear about his orientation.\n\nThe user's argument is that he didn't lead the friend on, but the friend might have developed feelings that weren't reciprocated. The key issue here is consent and clear communication. The user might have thought it was a casual arrangement, but the friend could have interpreted it as more. When the user stops, it might feel like a rejection, especially if the friend was emotionally invested.\n\nThe user's actions of engaging in the activity and then stopping could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. The friend might feel used or that the user wasn't honest about his intentions. Even if the user is straight, the repeated interactions could have created an expectation of reciprocity or emotional connection that wasn't there. \n\nAlso, the user's decision to reciprocate once might have caused discomfort for the friend, as it could imply more than just a one-time thing. The user's friend might feel that the user is treating the relationship as transactional or one-sided, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the user is struggling because he sees the friend as important, but the friend is now distant. The user's attempts to reach out are met with cold responses, which could be a result of feeling betrayed or unappreciated. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user might be at fault for not maintaining clear boundaries and for potentially misleading the friend about the nature of their relationship. Even if the user didn't intend to, the actions could have caused emotional harm to the friend. The friend's reaction, while hurtful, might be a response to feeling used or unrequited. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong for not being upfront and for not considering the emotional impact on the friend.\n"
