I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who engaged in a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted because he was single and horny. The friendship continued, and they had this arrangement for weeks or months. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the breakup, they resumed. The author later felt guilty and reciprocated, then told the friend they should stop. Now, the friend is cold and distant. Others said the author led him on, but the author claims it was clear they weren't interested romantically. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and clear boundaries. The author and the friend were both adults (18) and agreed to the arrangement initially. The author didn't promise anything romantic, just a physical relationship. The friend was okay when they stopped after the author got a girlfriend. The problem arose when the author ended the arrangement again, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author tried to reconnect but was ignored. The friend's reaction is the issue here.\n\nThe key factors are: mutual consent, clear communication about not being romantic, and the friend's emotional response after the author ended the arrangement. The author didn't force anything. However, the act of having a sexual relationship with a friend, even with consent, can complicate the friendship. When the author ended it, the friend felt betrayed or rejected, which is a common reaction. The author might be in the right in ending the relationship but didn't consider the friend's feelings, leading to the rift. However, the friend's reaction is also problematic. The author tried to explain and even apologized, but the friend's refusal to communicate might be their own issue.\n\nAnother angle is emotional manipulation. The friend might have become emotionally attached, leading to hurt feelings when the author ended it. But the author was clear from the start that they weren't interested romantically. The act of accepting the BJ and then reciprocating might have blurred the lines, making the friend feel used. However, the author didn't promise anything beyond physical interaction.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if all parties were adults and consented, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's reaction is more about their own emotional response than the author's actions. The author tried to maintain the friendship but the friend is now distant without addressing the issue. The author's actions were within the boundaries they set, so they aren't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
