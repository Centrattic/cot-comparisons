I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author initiated and continued the relationship while being in a monogamous relationship with a girlfriend. When the girlfriend dumped him, he resumed the arrangement. Then, he felt guilty and ended it, which led to the friend being cold. The author is confused because he thought it was clear he was straight and not interested romantically, but the friend is upset.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. Even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the act of engaging in a sexual relationship when the friend is gay might imply some level of emotional expectation, even if it's not verbalized. The author's decision to stop after feeling guilty could have been done without a clear explanation, leading to confusion and hurt feelings. Also, the author's actions during his girlfriend's relationship might be seen as a breach of trust, which could affect his credibility in claiming he didn't lead the friend on. The friend's reaction suggests that the relationship meant more to him, and the author's abrupt end without addressing the emotional aspect might have caused the cold response. So, the author might be at fault for not considering the friend's feelings beyond just the physical aspect and for not communicating clearly when ending the relationship.\n"
