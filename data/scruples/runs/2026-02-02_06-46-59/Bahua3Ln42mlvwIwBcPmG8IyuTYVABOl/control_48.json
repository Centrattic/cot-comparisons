I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight male who accepted blowjobs from a gay friend, then ended it when he felt guilty, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as heteroflexible, which means he's primarily straight but open to same-sex experiences. The friend is gay and offered oral sex. The author accepted multiple times, then stopped after getting a girlfriend. Later, when the relationship ended, they resumed, but the author then felt bad and stopped again, leading to the friend's coldness.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and intent. Both parties are adults (18), so legally, they're engaging in consensual acts. However, the issue arises when the author breaks off, possibly causing emotional harm to the friend. The friend might have developed feelings or felt used, even if the author didn't intend to. The author's actions could be seen as leading the friend on, even if he was clear about not being interested in a romantic relationship.\n\nThe friends were close, and the author's actions might have created an expectation of reciprocity or ongoing mutual participation. When the author stops, it could be perceived as rejection or a betrayal of trust. The fact that the author tried to communicate clearly but still caused hurt suggests that the way he ended it might have been abrupt or not empathetic enough. Also, the friend's reaction (being cold) indicates he felt hurt despite the author's intentions.\n\nWhile the author might not have intended harm, the impact on the friend is significant. The author could be seen as in the wrong for not fully considering the emotional consequences of ending the arrangement, even if it was consensual. The friend might feel that the author used him for sexual favors without regard for his feelings, especially after continuing the relationship post-breakup of the author's relationship.\n\nHowever, the author did communicate that he wasn't into reciprocating and tried to maintain the friendship. The main issue is whether the author's actions, despite clear communication, still caused harm through unmet expectations or emotional neglect. Since both are adults and the acts were consensual, the moral wrong might be more about the emotional aftermath rather than the act itself. But if the friend felt manipulated or hurt, the author's responsibility is to acknowledge that and take steps to mend the relationship or give space if needed.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, the resulting harm to the friend's feelings could place some responsibility on the author, making him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but there's nuance. However, given the friend's persistent behavior and the author's attempts to communicate, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author caused the friend emotional distress, even without intent, it's possible he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
