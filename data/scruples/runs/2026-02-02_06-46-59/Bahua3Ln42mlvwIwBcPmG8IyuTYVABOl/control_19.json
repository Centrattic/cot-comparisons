I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author is a straight, heteroflexible male. His gay friend offered him a blowjob, which he accepted. They did this several times over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the BJ arrangement. The author then felt bad, reciprocated, but felt awful and told the friend they should stop. After that, the friend became cold and distant. The author tried to reconnect but was ignored, and others said it's his fault. He's confused because he thought the friend knew the arrangement wasn't about love or commitment.\n\nFirst, the initial consent: the friend offered, the author accepted. But the author was in a relationship at one point, and then when the girlfriend left, they resumed. That might complicate things, especially if the girlfriend found out. But the main issue now is the aftermath when the author wanted to stop.\n\nThe author tried to reciprocate but felt bad and ended things. The friend is now distant. The author is upset because they want to maintain the friendship. Others say leading him on was the fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: consent was there initially, but when the author ended it, maybe the friend felt rejected or unappreciated. The author's actions of accepting the favors and then stopping could be seen as using the friend, even if there was no romantic intent. The friend's reaction suggests he felt hurt or used, even if the author didn't lead him on romantically.\n\nAlso, the age is 18, so they're adults. However, the dynamic of their relationship might have had emotional elements the author didn't consider. The author's main argument is that there was no romantic intention, but the friend might have had emotional investment beyond just the physical acts.\n\nIn some perspectives, even if there's no romantic intent, continuing a sexual arrangement and then abruptly ending it without considering the other person's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have added to the friend's hurt feelings, even if done in a nice way. The friend might feel that the author took advantage of his affection or felt unappreciated after giving without receiving in return, except once and then it was stopped.\n\nSo, while the author didn't lead him on romantically, the friendship's boundaries might have been crossed, and the way the author ended things could have been inconsiderate. The friend's cold reaction suggests he felt wronged, even if the author's intentions were clear. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's emotional state and perhaps not communicating better when ending the arrangement.\n\nBut there's also the aspect that the author was honest about not being romantic, and others say he didn't lead on. However, the friend might have had other expectations. It's a bit of a gray area, but considering the friend's hurt feelings and the author's role in the dynamic, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
