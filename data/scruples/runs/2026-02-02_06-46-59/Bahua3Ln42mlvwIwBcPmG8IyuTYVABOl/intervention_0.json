I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight-identified male accepting blowjobs from a gay friend, then later deciding to stop, which led to the friend becoming distant. \n\nFirst, the key points to consider: The friend was clear from the start that he's straight, so there's no expectation of romantic feelings. The gay friend offered the sexual favors, and the straight friend accepted. Then, after the friend got a girlfriend and ended the arrangement, it resumed after the breakup. The straight friend felt guilty about the one time he reciprocated and decided to stop. The gay friend is now upset and distant.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author (straight friend) is in the wrong, but they're seeking a second opinion. The main question is about whether the author is at fault. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author didn't lead on the gay friend in terms of romantic intentions, but they did engage in a sexual arrangement. When the author stopped reciprocating, maybe the gay friend felt betrayed or hurt. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have caused emotional harm. The gay friend might have felt used or that the relationship was transactional. The author ended it by being honest, but the friend's reaction is understandable. \n\nHowever, the author tried to communicate their boundaries clearly when they stopped. The problem might stem from the friend expecting a different outcome. Since both are 18, they might be navigating complex emotions and social dynamics. \n\nConsidering consent and communication, the author didn't force anything. The issue is more about the friend's feelings post-relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for ending a mutual arrangement, but they might have a responsibility to consider the emotional impact. But since the author was honest, maybe they aren't at fault. \n\nThe community's response (others saying it's the author's fault for leading on) is a bit harsh if there was no romantic intent. The author's actions were within their boundaries. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the situation is nuanced. The author might need to acknowledge the friend's feelings but isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
