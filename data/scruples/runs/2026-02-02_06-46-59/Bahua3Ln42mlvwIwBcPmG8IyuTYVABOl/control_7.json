I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a straight guy who's having blowjobs with his gay friend, then they stop when he gets a girlfriend, and then resume after the break-up. Then the author feels bad about reciprocating and stops, leading to the friend being distant. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the two friends. The author is straight but describes himself as heteroflexible. His friend is gay and initiated the Blowjob arrangement. The author didn't lead on in terms of romantic feelings, as he clarifies he's not interested in that. But the friend might have expected more than just a sexual arrangement, especially if there's a power imbalance or unspoken expectations.\n\nWhen the author started reciprocating and then stopped, maybe the friend felt rejected or that the arrangement was one-sided. Even though the author was clear about his orientation, the friend might have developed emotional feelings or expected the relationship to be mutual in some way. By reciprocating once and then ending it, the author might have made the friend feel used or that their feelings were not respected.\n\nAlso, the friend's cold response could be a reaction to feeling hurt, even if the author didn't intend to lead them on. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend beyond the initial agreement. So while there might not be malicious intent, the author's actions could have caused the friend to feel unappreciated or disregarded, leading to the strained relationship.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's possible the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate the boundaries clearly from the start, or perhaps didn't take into account the friend's potential emotional needs. Even if the arrangement was consensual, once the author reciprocated and then stopped, it might have broken some unspoken understanding. The friend might have felt that the author was taking advantage of their affection without mutual respect. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
