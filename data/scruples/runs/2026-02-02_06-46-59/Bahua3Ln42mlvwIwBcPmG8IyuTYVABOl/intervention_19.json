I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author feels confused because he thought he was clear about his boundaries and didn't lead the friend on.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to same-sex relationships but primarily heterosexual. The friend is gay and initiated the sexual relationship. The author accepted it when he was single but stopped when he got a girlfriend and later resumed after the breakup. The key point here is that the author was aware of his friend's sexual orientation and their dynamic.\n\nWhen the author ended the arrangement, the friend became distant. The author tried to reach out, but the friend was unresponsive. Others in a different sub said it's the author's fault for leading the friend on. The author argues he was clear about his boundaries.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Even if the author was clear, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend, especially one who is in a committed orientation towards the author's gender, can create unbalanced expectations. The friend might have developed feelings beyond just the physical, even if the author only saw it as a casual arrangement. When the author ended it, the friend felt rejected, leading to the cold response.\n\nThe author's actions might have caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally. The friend's reactions suggest he needed more consideration. The author might have been inconsiderate of the friend's feelings, not realizing the emotional investment. So, even if the author didn't mean to lead him on, the outcome suggests he was, which is why the friend is upset. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being mindful of the friend's emotional state and boundaries.\n"
