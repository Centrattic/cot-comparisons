I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given scenario. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend, then stopped when he got a girlfriend, and later resumed after the breakup. Then he reciprocated once but felt bad and ended it, leading to his friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. Both parties were of age (18), so legally, there's no issue there. The author was clear about not being interested in a romantic relationship, which the friend was okay with. However, the key point is the power dynamic and emotional impact. The friend might have developed feelings or felt used, even if it was mutual at first. When the author reciprocated, he felt sick and ended things, which could have hurt the friend's feelings. The friend's coldness now suggests he's hurt or feels rejected. The author might not have considered the emotional consequences beyond the initial arrangement. Also, resuming the relationship after the friend's offer post-breakup could have given false hope. Even though the author didn't lead on intentionally, the friend might have interpreted the actions as such. The author's friends in the sub said he's at fault for leading on, which could be valid. So, while there's no malicious intent, the author might have neglected the friend's emotional state, making him at least partially at fault. Answering A makes sense here.\n"
