I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight/heteroflexible guy and a gay friend engaging in sexual acts, then the author ends it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author is clear about his orientation, which is heteroflexible, meaning he might engage in same-sex activities but isn't gay. The friend is gay, so he's into the same sex. They started this arrangement when the author was single and then continued after the author got a girlfriend. When the author dumped his girlfriend, they resumed, but the author felt guilty and stopped. Now the friend is upset and distant.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both were adults and 18, so legally they could consent. The author didn't misrepresent his feelings; he was upfront about not being interested in a romantic relationship. However, the friend might have had unspoken expectations or felt used. The author ended the arrangement, which is his right, but the friend's reaction is a personal issue. The author isn't in the wrong for stopping the sexual relationship, especially since he made his boundaries clear. The friend's coldness is his own response, but the author isn't responsible for the friend's feelings beyond that. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
