I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong in this situation. The author, a straight heteroflexible male, had a gay friend who offered blowjobs. They engaged in this for a while, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author felt guilty and reciprocated once before stopping again. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused about who's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is gay, which means he's attracted to men. The author is straight but heteroflexible, which I think means he's open to some same-sex activities but not necessarily romantically. The friend initiating sexual acts might be based on his own attraction, but the author's participation could be problematic because he's not in a relationship with the friend and might be exploiting the situation.\n\nThe fact that the author continued this arrangement even after getting a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup suggests a pattern of using the friend for sexual favors without a romantic or emotional commitment. When the author reciprocated, he felt sick, which indicates he recognized something was wrong. The friend's coldness afterward is a clear sign of hurt feelings, possibly feeling used or disrespected.\n\nThe author claims they were clear about being straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, engaging in sexual acts, even if not romantic, can still be seen as leading someone on, especially when one party is in a relationship. The author's actions might have given the friend false hope or made him feel objectified. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating shows he realized the emotional impact, but the damage was already done.\n\nThe advice from others that it's the author's fault for leading on makes sense here. Even if the author didn't intend to, the actions could be perceived as such. The key issue is consent and mutual respect. While the friend initiated the acts, the author's acceptance and continuation might not have considered the friend's emotional investment. The author's responsibility includes acknowledging the friend's feelings and not engaging in activities that could harm the friendship or the friend's self-esteem.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, though perhaps not malicious, likely hurt the friend's feelings. The author should take responsibility for the emotional impact and respect the friend's need for space, even if it's difficult.\n"
