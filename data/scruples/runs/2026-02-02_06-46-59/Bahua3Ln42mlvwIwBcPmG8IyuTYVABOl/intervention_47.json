I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with his gay friend. They started when he was single, then stopped after he got a girlfriend. When the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. Then the author felt guilty and tried to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, so he stopped and told his friend they should stop. Now the friend is being cold and distant, and the author is confused about why.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The friend is gay, so he's likely interested in a romantic relationship, but the author is straight and heteroflexible. The initial arrangement was non-consensual? Wait, no, they both agreed. But maybe the friend had different expectations. The author might have led the friend on by engaging in the sexual activity without being clear about his intentions. Even though he said he's straight, maybe the friend hoped there could be more. When the author tried to reciprocate, he felt sick and ended it, which might have been a cue that he wasn't comfortable with any deeper relationship, but the friend might have interpreted this as rejection, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nAlso, resuming the arrangement after the breakup could have been a problem. The author might have been using the friend for sex when he had a girlfriend, which is cheating. But he stopped when he got a girlfriend, so that's good. Then when the girlfriend dumped him, starting again might have been seen as taking advantage. The friend might feel used. The author then tried to reciprocate, which was uncomfortable, so he ended it. The friend's reaction is being cold, which suggests he's hurt. The author's messages to apologize might not have been sufficient, or maybe the friend felt disrespected. \n\nThe key points are: mutual consent initially, but possible miscommunication about expectations. The author might have not been transparent about his feelings or intentions, leading the friend to believe there was a possibility of a relationship. Even though the author is straight, his actions could have given false hope. Also, the fact that he ended the arrangement abruptly after reciprocating might have hurt the friend's feelings. The friend being gay might mean he wanted more than just a physical relationship. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. The friend might have felt used or that his affection wasn't respected. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't consider the friend's emotional needs and abruptly ended the arrangement after the friend had invested emotionally. The answer would be A.\n"
