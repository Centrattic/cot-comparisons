I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight guy who had a gay friend. They started having a sexual relationship where the friend gave him blowjobs. Then when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the breakup, they resumed. The author later tried reciprocating but felt bad and ended it. Now the friend is being distant, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries and communication here. The author mentions he's heteroflexible, which I think means he's mostly straight but open to some same-sex experiences. The friend is gay. So, from the start, the friend was offering something that the author was okay with given his current situation. But when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which seems appropriate because being in a relationship usually means you're not involved with others.\n\nThen when the author's girlfriend dumped him, they went back to the same arrangement. The problem here might be that the author is using the friend for sexual favors without a clear understanding of the emotional implications. Even if the author is straight, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend can complicate the friendship, especially when there's a power dynamic or one-sided expectations.\n\nThe key point is that the author didn't reciprocate until later, which might have made the friend feel used or that the relationship was one-sided. When the author tried to reciprocate, he felt bad and ended it, which could have left the friend feeling rejected or unappreciated. The author's friend being cold might be a reaction to feeling emotionally hurt or used, even if the author didn't mean to lead him on.\n\nThe author argues that he was clear about his orientation and didn't intend to form a romantic relationship. However, the friend's feelings might have been hurt by the one-sided sexual arrangement. The author might not have considered the friend's emotional needs beyond the physical aspect. When the author stopped, the friend could have felt rejected, especially if he had deeper feelings or if the arrangement was a way for him to cope with his own orientation.\n\nAlso, the author's initial acceptance of the sexual acts might have given the friend hope for a closer relationship, which the author hasn't reciprocated. Even if it's just a physical arrangement, the friend might have expected mutual respect and perhaps some emotional reciprocation. The author's friend might feel that the friendship became transactional, and when the author stopped, it ended the friendship without proper closure.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author claims he was clear about his boundaries, but maybe the friend misinterpreted the actions. The author's actions (engaging in sexual activities) might have contradicted his words about being straight, leading the friend to hope for more, which the author didn't provide. The author's decision to reciprocate once but then end it could have been confusing or hurtful.\n\nThe advice from others that the author led him on makes sense because even if the author didn't have romantic intentions, the consistent sexual interactions might have created expectations the friend wasn't aware were one-sided. The author might have been in the wrong by not addressing the potential emotional impact of their arrangement and not maintaining clear, consistent communication about the nature of their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings and for creating a situation where the friend felt used or unappreciated. The friendship's breakdown could be a result of the author's failure to maintain open communication and respect the friend's emotional needs beyond the physical.\n"
