I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this a few times until he got a girlfriend, then stopped. When the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Later, the author felt bad for the friend always performing the act, so he reciprocated, but felt awful and told the friend they should stop. Now the friend is distant and unresponsive. The author is confused because others say he led the friend on, but he thought it was clear he wasn't interested in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's friend is gay, so he's looking for some form of connection. By accepting the friend's offers, the author might have given the impression of mutual interest or at least some level of romantic engagement, even if it wasn't explicit. The fact that they continued this arrangement over time could lead the friend to expect a certain level of reciprocity or a deeper emotional connection.\n\nWhen the author reciprocated and then decided to stop, it might have been confusing or hurtful for the friend. The friend's cold response suggests feelings of rejection or being used. The author's initial acceptance and the repeated visits might have led the friend to believe there was some form of mutual understanding or ongoing arrangement. Even if the author didn't intend to lead on, the friend's perspective matters here.\n\nAlso, the author's actions when he reciprocated and then stopped might have made the friend feel unappreciated or disrespected. The friend might have invested emotionally in the relationship, especially if he's gay and seeking affection or comfort. The author's decision to stop without fully addressing the friend's feelings could contribute to the friend's withdrawal.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on their friendship. The author mentions they used to do a lot together, but now the friend is distant. By engaging in these acts, even platonically, the author might have created a dynamic where the friend felt the friendship was transactional or conditional on the sexual activity. When that stops, the friend feels the friendship is over, which is why he's pulling away.\n\nThe author's justification is that he clarifies his straightness from the start, but actions can speak louder than words. If the friend felt the need to perform these acts for the friendship to continue, then the author might be inadvertently creating an expectation that isn't met when he stops. The friend's loneliness or unmet emotional needs could be a factor here.\n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, the initial agreement was mutual, but maintaining that respect requires ongoing communication. The author didn't set clear boundaries from the beginning about what he was comfortable with, leading to a situation where the friend might have felt it was okay to continue until told otherwise. The author's sudden change in behavior after reciprocating could have been unanticipated and hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author did make an effort to communicate his discomfort and stop the behavior, which is a responsible action. But the aftermath of the friend's reaction might indicate that the friendship was built on a foundation that the author didn't realize was fragile. The key issue here is the mismatch in expectations between the two friends. The author might not have considered the emotional weight his actions carried for his friend, leading to the friend feeling used or rejected.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, the way the situation unfolded does put him in the wrong. He contributed to the friend's sense of rejection by continuing the arrangement and then abruptly stopping without addressing the emotional impact. The friend's feelings of being led on, even if unintentionally, make the author responsible for mending the relationship or accepting that the friendship has changed.\n"
