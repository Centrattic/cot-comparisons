I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a specific situation. The scenario involves the author taking blowjobs from a gay friend, then breaking it off after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. The friend is now acting cold and distant.\n\nFirst, the author is described as \"straight and heteroflexible.\" The friend is gay and offered the oral sex. The author accepted, which might be consensual. But when the author's girlfriend dumps him, they resume the arrangement and then the author stops after reciprocating, feeling guilty. The friend is upset and distant. Others say it's the author's fault for leading him on, but the author claims there was no romantic implication.\n\nNow, considering consent and boundaries. Both parties were 18, so legally adults. The initial arrangement was consensual, but maybe the friend felt it was a one-sided thing. The author didn't pursue a romantic relationship, which the friend might have hoped for. When the author reciprocated and then stopped, it might have hurt the friend's feelings, leading to the coldness. The author might have given mixed signals by continuing the arrangement after getting a girlfriend and then breaking up with the girlfriend, which could imply a shift in priorities.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author respected the friend's feelings. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friend's emotional investment might have been overlooked. When the author stopped, it could have been perceived as rejection, which is hard on the friend. The author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was potential for more, even if the author didn't see it that way. \n\nSo, while the initial acts were consensual, the ongoing arrangement might have crossed into emotional territory for the friend. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have been abrupt and hurtful. The friend's reaction is understandable if they felt used. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering the friend's emotional state and for not maintaining clear boundaries from the start.\n"
