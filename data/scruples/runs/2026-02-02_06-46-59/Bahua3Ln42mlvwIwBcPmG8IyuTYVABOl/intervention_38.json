I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a straight guy had a gay friend who offered to give him blowjobs. They did this a few times before the author had a girlfriend, then stopped. After the breakup, they resumed, but then the author decided to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, so he told his friend to stop. Now the friend is being cold and distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Both are adults, 18, so legally they can consent. The friend initiated the offer, and the author agreed. There's no indication of coercion here. The friend is gay, so maybe he was interested in a sexual relationship but the author wasn't. However, the author is heteroflexible, which might mean he's open to same-sex relationships but in this case, he's clear he's straight.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. The author and his friend had an arrangement where the friend was providing oral sex, but it was one-sided. Then the author tried to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, so he stopped. The friend might have felt rejected, especially if he was invested emotionally or saw it as a relationship. Even though the author is straight, the friend might have developed feelings, leading to hurt when the author changed his behavior.\n\nThe author's friends on another sub said he led the friend on, which is a common accusation here. The author didn't explicitly state that he was interested in a romantic or sexual relationship beyond the one-sided act. However, engaging in sexual activity can imply some level of intimacy, even if not romantic. The author might not have realized the emotional impact of ending the arrangement, especially after reciprocating once.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction\u2014becoming cold and distant\u2014suggests that he felt hurt or rejected. The author's attempt to reach out after the holiday was ignored, which complicates things. The author might have a duty to acknowledge the friend's feelings, even if he's not at fault. But since both are adults and the initial acts were consensual, the fault might lie in the friend's reaction rather than the author's actions.\n\nHowever, the fact that the author had a girlfriend and then resumed the arrangement after breaking up might be problematic. It could be seen as using the friend for sexual favors without considering the friend's emotional state. Even if the author isn't in a relationship now, the friend might have felt objectified.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did communicate his discomfort and tried to stop the behavior. But the friend's emotional response is valid, and the author might need to take some responsibility for how his actions affected the friend, even if he didn't intend to lead him on. The author's friends are now distant, which is a consequence he might have to live with, but it's unclear if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were consensual and he communicated his boundaries, but the friend might have had unmet emotional expectations. The author's intentions were clear, but people can misinterpret actions. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. However, the friend's perspective is important. If the friend felt led on, even unintentionally, the author might share some responsibility for not managing expectations better. But since both agreed to the initial arrangement, it's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer might be A, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he communicated his boundaries, but the situation is complicated.\n"
