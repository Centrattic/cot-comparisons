I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. Now the friend is acting cold.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author accepted the friend's offer, which was a mutual agreement. However, when the author started a relationship, they stopped, which the friend was okay with. After the breakup, they resumed, and the author later decided to stop after reciprocating, which made the friend upset. The friend is now distant.\n\nThe author claims they were clear about their orientation and didn't lead the friend on. But the friend felt used or rejected. The author's actions changed from being open to a one-sided arrangement to ending it, which might have hurt the friend's feelings. The friend's reaction is understandable if he felt emotionally invested, even if there wasn't a romantic or emotional relationship. The author might have not considered the friend's feelings when ending things, even if they were honest about their orientation. The fact that the friend was giving so much and then suddenly it stopped could make him feel devalued. While the author didn't intend to lead him on, the actions might have done so. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact on the friend.\n"
