I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about two 18-year-old guys who are good friends. One of them (the author) is straight but heteroflexible, and the other is gay. The author accepted blowjobs from the gay friend, then they stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they started again, but then the author felt bad and stopped, which made the friend upset. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The initial arrangement was consensual, right? Both parties agreed to it. But then the author started a relationship, which probably meant they had to stop. When the author broke up, they resumed the activity. However, the author later decided to stop, which led to the friend being upset. \n\nThe key points here are communication and the friend's feelings. The author claims they were never leading him on, but maybe the friend felt that the physical relationship was a form of emotional connection or perhaps hoped for more. Even if the author didn't have romantic feelings, the act of engaging in sexual activities might have made the friend feel that there was an emotional bond that the author was breaking when they stopped. \n\nAlso, when the author tried to reconcile after the breakup, the friend didn't respond well. The author might have not communicated their feelings clearly when ending the physical relationship. Even though they said it was \"nicely,\" the friend might have felt rejected or unappreciated. \n\nAnother angle is societal norms and expectations. In some contexts, engaging in sexual acts even with mutual consent can create emotional tensions, especially between friends where there's an imbalance in attraction. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend, even if it wasn't their intention. \n\nSo, while the author didn't force anything and the initial acts were consensual, the way they ended the physical relationship and the subsequent emotional fallout might make them at least partially responsible for the friend's hurt feelings. The author might have led the friend to believe there was a reciprocal emotional connection that wasn't there, which is leading to the friend feeling used or disregarded. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the emotional implications of stopping the physical relationship after the friend had invested in it, even if it was consensual. The friend's feelings of being used or rejected could be valid, and the author's failure to maintain open communication about their intentions might be a mistake.\n"
