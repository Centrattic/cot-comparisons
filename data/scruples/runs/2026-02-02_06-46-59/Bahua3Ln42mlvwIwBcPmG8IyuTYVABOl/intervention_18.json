I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for a series of events involving a gay friend. The key points are:\n\n1. The author, a straight/heteroflexible guy, accepted blowjobs from his gay friend when they were both single. \n2. They continued this arrangement until the author got a girlfriend, then resumed after a breakup.\n3. The author then reciprocated, but felt bad and ended things, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n4. Others say the author led the friend on, but the author claims it was clear he wasn't interested romantically.\n\nHmm. The author's actions involve engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend, which could be seen as non-consensual or exploitative. Even if the friend is gay, the author's participation might have created emotional expectations. The fact that they resumed after the author's breakup and then the author reciprocated but felt guilt might indicate mixed signals. The friend's cold response suggests hurt feelings. The author might be at fault for not considering the emotional impact and for potentially using the friend sexually without a clear mutual understanding. Even if they were both adults, the imbalance of power or emotional investment could be an issue. Also, the author's claim of not leading on might not hold if the friend felt a connection beyond just the physical. So, yes, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
