I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. So, first, I need to understand the scenario step by step.\n\nThe author is a straight, heteroflexible male. He had a gay friend who offered him a blowjob. They engaged in this a few times over weeks/months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, they resumed. The author then reciprocated a few weeks ago but felt bad and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is cold and distant, ignoring the author's attempts to reconnect. The author is confused because he thought they were just friends, and others said he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight.\n\nSo the main question is: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider consent and intentions. Both parties initially agreed to the arrangement. The friend was gay, so maybe he had a different emotional investment. The author, being straight, might not have seen the act as part of a romantic relationship but as a platonic sexual favor. However, the act itself is a sexual act, which can have different meanings depending on the context and the people involved. \n\nWhen the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which makes sense if they wanted to be faithful. Then, after the breakup, resuming might have been a mistake because the friend might have hoped for something more than just casual again. When the author reciprocated, that could have been a point where the friend felt the relationship was becoming more mutual or intimate, but the author pulled back, which might have hurt the friend's feelings. \n\nThe friend's reaction of being cold and distant suggests that he felt rejected or used. Even if the author was clear about being straight, the repeated sexual encounters might have led the friend to hope for a romantic connection. The author's actions could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions, regardless of intent, caused emotional harm. The friend might have felt that the sexual relationship was a form of intimacy that the author wasn't willing to reciprocate in an emotional or romantic way. Since they were friends, the friend might have had unspoken expectations that went beyond casual sex. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author had a girlfriend and then resumed the relationship after the breakup might complicate things. The friend might have felt that the author was using him for sexual purposes when he was available, which could be seen as exploiting the friendship. \n\nThe author's decision to reciprocate and then back out might have been the final straw for the friend. Even if the author tried to explain it was a mistake, the friend's feelings might still be hurt. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of their actions, which is a common issue in such situations. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to lead the friend on, the actions did cause harm. In relationships, whether romantic or platonic, intentions matter, but so do the effects of one's actions. If the friend felt used or that his feelings weren't respected, then the author is at least partially at fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions, even if not malicious, led to the friend feeling rejected and caused the breakdown of their friendship. The author should have been more considerate of the friend's feelings and possibly set clearer boundaries from the start to avoid mutual expectations that weren't met.\n"
