Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight dude who had a gay friend. The friend offered him a blowjob, and since he was single and horny, he accepted. They did this a few times. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Then he felt bad, sucked the friend once, but immediately felt awful and told him to stop. Now the friend is acting cold and distant, and the author is confused about whether he's the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heteroflexible, which means he can be attracted to both genders. The friend is gay, so he's into men. The friend offered oral sex, which is a sexual act. The author accepted, which might be okay if both parties consented. But then, when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which seems responsible because he was in a relationship. Then after the breakup, they resumed, which could be problematic because maybe the friend thought there was a chance of a romantic relationship, but the author clarified his stance.\n\nThe key point is the mutual consent. The author didn't lead the friend on in terms of emotional attachment, as he was clear about being straight. However, the act of reciprocating by performing oral sex might have been confusing for the friend, even if it was a one-time thing. The friend might have felt used or that the author was taking advantage of his affection. The author's actions could have hurt the friend's feelings, even if there was no romantic intent.\n\nThe friend's reaction\u2014becoming cold and distant\u2014might be a result of feeling rejected or unappreciated. The author's apology was nice, but maybe it came too late or didn't address the friend's feelings properly. Even if the author thought he was clear about his orientation, the ongoing sexual activity might have created mixed signals. The friend might have hoped for more than just a sexual arrangement, leading to emotional distress when it ended.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were 18 and in a formative time might mean they didn't fully understand the complexities of their actions. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on his friend beyond the physical act. Even if there was consent, the lack of emotional reciprocity or the imbalance in the relationship could be a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that engaging in sexual acts with a friend, especially when there's an imbalance in emotional investment, is problematic. The author's decision to reciprocate once but then stop might have caused confusion. The friend could feel that the author was taking advantage of his affection without offering the same in return, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nSo, while the author didn't have romantic intentions and was clear about his orientation, his actions might have still hurt his friend's feelings. The friend's withdrawal is a natural response to feeling used or emotionally neglected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, not for the sexual acts themselves (which were consensual), but for not considering the emotional aspects and the friend's feelings, leading to the breakdown of the friendship. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
