I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author and his friend engaged in mutual oral sex. The author is straight, so he didn't engage in any romantic or emotional commitment. They stopped when the author got a girlfriend, then resumed after the breakup. The key point is that the author later reciprocated, which made him uncomfortable, so he stopped. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author feels hurt because they were close friends before.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. From a moral standpoint, the author didn't force or pressure the friend. The arrangement was consensual and both parties knew the boundaries. The author ended the arrangement when he felt uncomfortable, which is his right. The friend's reaction is a result of his own feelings, perhaps unmet expectations or emotional attachment. However, the author might have been aware that the friend could get hurt, but since the relationship was purely physical and the boundaries were clear, it's hard to blame the author for ending it. The fact that the friend was okay when they first stopped during the author's relationship suggests that the friend's current reaction is more about personal feelings rather than the author's actions being inherently wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
