I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who engaged in sexual acts with a gay friend, then stopped after getting a girlfriend and later breaking up. He felt bad about the friend doing all the giving, so he reciprocated, but then stopped because he felt uncomfortable. Now his friend is distant, and others say it's his fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of their relationship. Both are 18, so they're young adults. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The author was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend offered the Blowjob (BJ), and the author accepted. There's no indication of non-consensual acts here. \n\nHowever, the issue arises when they continued this arrangement after the author had a girlfriend. That might be a breach of trust if the girlfriend wasn't aware, but the post says they stopped when the author got a girlfriend. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. The author might have felt guilty about the power imbalance (friend always giving, author receiving), so he tried to reciprocate but felt bad about it. He then stopped, which could have been a shock to his friend who might have been emotionally invested beyond the physical.\n\nThe friend's reaction\u2014becoming cold and distant\u2014could stem from feeling used or unappreciated. The author's attempts to reconnect were met with indifference, leading him to question if he's in the wrong. The others in the sub said he led the friend on. The question is whether the author's actions were deceptive or if he misrepresented his intentions.\n\nThe author claimed from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. If that was clear, maybe the friend misunderstood the nature of the relationship. But by engaging in sexual acts, there might be an implicit expectation of mutual satisfaction, which the author disrupted by stopping reciprocation. The friend might feel that the author took advantage of his affection or emotional availability.\n\nAlso, the age factor: at 18, their understanding of relationships and boundaries might still be developing. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on his friend beyond the physical act. The friend's distress could be valid, even if the author didn't intend harm.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? It depends on whether he knowingly took advantage or failed to communicate properly. Since he tried to communicate his feelings when he stopped, but the friend was hurt, there might be a lack of mutual understanding. The author's actions, while possibly not malicious, could have been inconsiderate of the friend's feelings, leading to the friend's withdrawal. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not maintaining clear boundaries or not anticipating the emotional consequences.\n"
