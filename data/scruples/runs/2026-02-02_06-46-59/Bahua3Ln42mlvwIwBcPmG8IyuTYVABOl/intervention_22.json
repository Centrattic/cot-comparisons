I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a friend who's gay. The friend offered him a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this a few times over some months. Then he got a girlfriend, they stopped, the girlfriend dumped him, and they resumed. He later felt bad and reciprocated, but then realized it wasn't for him and decided to stop, which made his friend upset. Now, the friend is being cold and distant.\n\nFirst, the author is straight, but he had a sexual relationship with his friend. The friend is gay, so maybe the friend had romantic feelings involved? Even if the author didn't reciprocate those feelings, the friend might have felt like there was some emotional connection or expectation beyond just the physical. The author mentions that they were very good friends before this started, so maybe the friend felt the dynamic changed. \n\nWhen the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which is good. But after the breakup, they resumed the physical relationship. Then the author tried to reciprocate but felt uncomfortable. He told the friend they should stop. The friend's reaction is being cold and distant. The author is confused because he thought he was clear about his feelings and that it was just a physical arrangement.\n\nThe key points here might be about consent, clear communication, and emotional impact. If the author was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested romantically, but the friend still engaged in the physical activity, maybe there's an issue of the friend's own expectations. However, when the author tried to reciprocate and then ended it, maybe the friend felt rejected or used. \n\nAlso, the author's friend might have had unspoken emotional expectations. Even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the act of engaging in sexual activity might have created emotional attachment or expectations of reciprocity that the author didn't account for. The author might not have considered how his actions affected the friend's feelings, even if he was honest about his own.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as using the friend for sexual favors without considering the emotional toll. Even if it was mutual initially, ending it might have hurt the friend's feelings more than the author anticipated. The author's decision to reciprocate once and then stop might have confused the friend, leading to the coldness now.\n\nSo, even though the author was honest about his orientation, the way he handled the situation could have been more considerate. The friend might have felt that the author took advantage of his affection. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more mindful of the friend's emotional state and for not maintaining a clear boundary that respects both parties' feelings.\n"
