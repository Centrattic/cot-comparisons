I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a straight guy who got into a situation where a gay friend offered him blowjobs, and he accepted. They did this several times, then the author got a girlfriend and they stopped. When the author's girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the oral sex. Then the author felt bad when he had to reciprocate, so he told his friend to stop. Now the friend is acting cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is heterosexual but identifies as heteroflexible, meaning he might be open to same-sex activities occasionally. The friend is gay and offered oral sex. The author accepted, which might be okay consensually if both parties agreed. But the problem arises when the author starts a relationship with someone else (a girlfriend) and then resumes the oral sex after the breakup. \n\nWhen the author had a girlfriend, they stopped the arrangement, which was probably the right thing to do. But after the breakup, starting again might complicate things. Then, when the author decides to reciprocate, he feels uncomfortable and ends it. The friend is now upset, which makes the author question if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social perspective, even if it's consensual, there's an emotional aspect here. The author might have led the friend on, even if he didn't have romantic intentions. The friend might have had deeper feelings or expected a romantic relationship, but the author only wanted a sexual arrangement. When the author ends it, the friend feels rejected or hurt. The author's initial acceptance of the oral sex might have given the friend false hope about a potential relationship, which the author didn't reciprocate in any romantic way.\n\nAlso, the author's actions after getting a girlfriend and then resuming the activity after the breakup could be seen as using the friend for sexual purposes without considering the friend's feelings. The friend might have felt that the author was treating the relationship as transactional, which can damage trust and friendship. \n\nThe key points are consent and communication. While the actions were consensual, the lack of clear boundaries and the emotional consequences suggest that the author might have been inconsiderate of the friend's feelings. Even if the author didn't lead on romantically, the friend might have developed feelings that weren't acknowledged. The author's decision to reciprocate once and then cut things off could have been confusing or hurtful, especially if the friend was emotionally invested.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have failed to maintain clear communication about his intentions, which led to the friend feeling hurt. The friend's reaction of becoming cold is a natural response to feeling used or rejected. The author's attempts to reconnect after the friend's withdrawal might not be effective if the friend isn't ready to move past the hurt.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while not illegal, might be ethically questionable due to the emotional impact on the friend. Even if the author didn't have romantic intentions, the lack of clear communication and the resulting hurt feelings could make him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
