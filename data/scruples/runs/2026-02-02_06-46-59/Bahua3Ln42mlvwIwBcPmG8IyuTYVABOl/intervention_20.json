I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person described in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight-identifying male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is heteroflexible, which means he's open to same-sex experiences but primarily attracted to the opposite sex. He had a mutual understanding with his gay friend for oral sex. When the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which the friend was okay with. After the breakup, they resumed the activity. Then the author tried to reciprocate, felt uncomfortable, and set a boundary, which led to the friend becoming distant.\n\nNow, considering consent and boundaries. Both parties initially agreed to the arrangement. The author didn't force it; he chose to participate and later set clear boundaries when he felt it was becoming one-sided. The friend's reaction seems to be about rejection, which is a common emotional response to having a relationship or connection end. However, the author was honest about his orientation from the start, so there's no deception. The friend might have had unmet expectations, but the author made it clear it wasn't a romantic or committed relationship.\n\nThe argument that the author led him on might come from the fact that they had a consistent arrangement, but the author never misrepresented his feelings. The friend's hurt feelings are valid, but the author had the right to set boundaries. The key here is whether the author acted deceitfully or without consent. Since the author was upfront and both parties were on board initially, ending the arrangement isn't unethical. The friend's coldness is a reaction to rejection, not a moral failing on the author's part. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no manipulation or harm. The author isn't exploiting; he's setting personal limits. The friend's reaction is emotional but not a justification for blaming the author. So I think B makes sense here.\n"
