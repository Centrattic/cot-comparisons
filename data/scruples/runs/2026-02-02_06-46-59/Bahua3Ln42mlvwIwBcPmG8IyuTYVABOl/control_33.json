I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because others say it's their fault, but they didn't lead the friend on.\n\nFirst, the key points: both are 18, the friend is gay, the author is straight but heteroflexible. The arrangement started when the author was single and then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, but the author felt bad and ended it. Now the friend is cold. Others say the author led the friend on, but the author claims it was clear he's not interested beyond the physical act.\n\nI need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The main issues here are consent, communication, and the nature of the relationship. The author and the friend had a mutual understanding initially. The author didn't hide his orientation but was clear about not being in love or wanting a romantic relationship. The problem arises when the author ended the arrangement, possibly making the friend feel rejected or used. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if the friend developed feelings beyond the physical, even if the author didn't intend to lead him on. The friend's reaction suggests emotional hurt, which the author might not have anticipated. The author ended things abruptly after reciprocating, which could have been more sensitive. However, the author did communicate clearly that they weren't interested in more than the physical aspect. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if both parties agreed to the arrangement without expectations, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the friend might have had unspoken emotional needs that weren't met. The key is whether the author was aware of these needs and ignored them. Since the author didn't explicitly lead the friend on but ended the relationship, it's a gray area. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because there was mutual agreement initially, but the abrupt ending could have contributed to the friend's hurt feelings. However, others might argue that even with mutual agreement, ending the relationship caused harm, making the author partly responsible. The final call depends on whether the author's actions crossed into emotional manipulation, which isn't clear here. The friend's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's intentions were clear. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the author could have handled the end more sensitively. However, based on the information given, the author's actions were within agreed boundaries, so they aren't the one at fault.\n"
