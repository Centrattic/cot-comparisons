I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then broke things off when he felt guilty. The friend became distant, and the user is questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the user initiated a sexual relationship with a friend, which was consensual initially. But when he got a girlfriend, they stopped, which the friend was okay with. Then, after the breakup, they resumed the arrangement. The user then tried to reciprocate, felt uncomfortable, and ended it. The friend is now upset, and the user is confused because he thought he was clear about his boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The user had a clear understanding of his orientation and communicated that he wasn't interested in a romantic or emotional relationship. However, the act of engaging in sexual activities, even if one-sided, can create emotional attachments or expectations. The friend might have developed feelings or expectations beyond the initial arrangement, leading to hurt when the user ended it. The user's decision to stop was communicated politely, but the aftermath shows that the friend was affected. \n\nEven though the user didn't intend to lead the friend on, the act of accepting sexual favors and then stopping could be seen as leading to some emotional investment. The user's own discomfort when reciprocating might indicate underlying guilt or inconsistency in the arrangement. The friend's reaction suggests that the user's actions had an impact, even if unintentional. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user might have a duty to consider how their actions affect others, even if the initial understanding was clear. The friend's emotional response points to the user's role in creating a situation where the friend felt used or rejected. Therefore, while the user may not have acted maliciously, the outcome still places some responsibility on him for not anticipating the emotional consequences.\n"
