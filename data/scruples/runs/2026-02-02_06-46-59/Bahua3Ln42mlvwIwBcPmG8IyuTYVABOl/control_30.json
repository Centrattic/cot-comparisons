I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight/heteroflexible man who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then later ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, the author initiated and then ended the sexual relationship. The friend is gay, so he's likely in this for more than just mutual benefit. The author had a girlfriend and stopped during that time, which is responsible. But when the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. The author then tried reciprocating but felt uncomfortable and stopped, which seems honest. The issue is the friend's reaction\u2014being cold and distant. The author feels wronged, but others say he led the friend on.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, any sexual arrangement outside a clear mutual understanding can be problematic. The author was upfront about his sexuality, so he didn't mislead. However, the friend's feelings might have developed beyond just the physical, leading to hurt when it ended. The author's actions, while honest, might have ignored the friend's emotional investment. But since the author was clear about his boundaries and didn't reciprocitate romantic feelings, it's not entirely his fault. However, the ongoing friendship and the way it ended could have been handled better. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for empathy towards the friend's feelings. So, the answer would be B (No), but with nuance.\n"
