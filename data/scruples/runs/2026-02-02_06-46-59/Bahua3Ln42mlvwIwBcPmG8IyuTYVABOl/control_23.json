I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a straight/heteroflexible man accepting blowjobs from a gay friend, then breaking things off after getting a girlfriend and later dumping him. The friend became cold and distant after the author stopped the sexual arrangement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author started a sexual relationship with a friend, knowing he's straight and the friend is gay. The friend might have had different expectations\u2014maybe he thought there was a chance of a romantic relationship or that the author was more flexible. The author then ended the arrangement after feeling uncomfortable, which is their right, but the friend is now upset. \n\nThe author's main defense is that they were clear about their orientation and didn't lead the friend on romantically. However, engaging in sexual activities even with clear boundaries can blur lines. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. \n\nThe author did communicate their feelings when they stopped the arrangement, but the friend might have felt used or emotionally hurt. Even if the author was clear about being straight, the act of engaging in sexual acts repeatedly could have implications. The friend's reaction suggests he felt attached or that the relationship was more meaningful to him than just casual sex. \n\nAlso, the fact that they resumed the activity after the author's girlfriend dumped them complicates things. The author might have been using the friend as a convenience, which can be hurtful. The friend's coldness after being rejected could be due to feeling unappreciated or not respected. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even if both parties consented, there's a potential for exploitation if one person is in a more vulnerable position (the friend being gay and possibly in a minority group). The author might not realize that the friend's actions were a form of emotional investment, leading to hurt when the author pulled away. \n\nThe author's confusion about being in the wrong despite clear communication is valid, but emotional harm can occur even without explicit leading on. The key issue is whether the author respected the friend's feelings and the nature of their friendship. Ending a sexual arrangement can be awkward, but the friend's behavior after shows distress, indicating the author's actions had a negative impact. \n\nTherefore, while the author might not have intended to hurt, the situation's dynamics suggest that they are in the wrong for contributing to the friend's emotional distress. The answer is A.\n"
