I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their actions. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped when he got a girlfriend, and later resumed after the breakup. He decided to stop again because he felt uncomfortable, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author initially agreed to the sexual activity, which was consensual. When he got a girlfriend, they stopped, which he mentions the friend was okay with. Later, after the breakup, they resumed the activity. The key point is that the author felt bad about the one-sided nature and decided to stop. He communicated this in a respectful way, not meanly. The friend's reaction is being cold and not responding well, which the author finds confusing since they were close friends before.\n\nThe argument from others is that leading him on might be the issue. However, the author claims he made it clear he's straight and wouldn't have romantic feelings. The question is whether the author is at fault for the friend's reaction. The author tried to mend things by sending a heartfelt message but got a minimal response. Now, he's conflicted about leaving the friend alone despite their friendship.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author acted based on his feelings and communicated his boundaries. The friend's reaction stems from feeling rejected or manipulated, but the author didn't intend to harm. The main issue is whether the author had the right to engage in consensual activity that the friend wanted, then stop without causing harm. Since the author didn't mislead and communicated his stance, the fault might lie more with the friend's inability to handle the rejection. However, some might argue that any sexual relationship between friends, even if consensual, can complicate the friendship. But since the author tried to address it and the friend is reacting negatively, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
