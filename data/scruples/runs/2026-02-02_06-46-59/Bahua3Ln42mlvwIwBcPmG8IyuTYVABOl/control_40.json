I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped when he got a girlfriend, resumed after the breakup, and then ended it again after feeling uncomfortable. Now the friend is distant.\n\nFirst, the author was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend offered the Blowjob, and the author accepted. They had a mutual understanding. Then when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which the friend was okay with. Later, after a breakup, they resumed, and then the author felt bad and stopped again, explaining his discomfort. The friend became cold, and the author is confused about why the friend is upset.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both parties were adults (18 years old), and the initial arrangement was consensual. The author didn't lead the friend on; he was upfront about his orientation. When the situation changed again, the author communicated his feelings clearly and respectfully. The friend's reaction is now causing the conflict. \n\nHowever, some might argue that having a sexual relationship, even with mutual consent, can create emotional complications, especially between close friends. The author might have thought that stopping the activity would resolve things, but the friend's feelings of rejection or unrequited emotions could be why he's distant. The question is whether the author had a responsibility to avoid the situation in the first place. Since the author was honest about his boundaries and ended things politely, it's hard to say he's at fault. The friend's response is his own emotional reaction, not the author's wrongdoing. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that even consensual actions can lead to hurt feelings, so the author should have anticipated that. But given the information, the author acted within his boundaries and communicated clearly. So the answer seems to lean towards B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
