I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight guy having a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ending it when he gets a girlfriend and later dumps him. The friend becomes cold after the author stops the sexual activity.\n\nFirst, the author is described as heteroflexible, meaning he's mostly straight but open to some same-sex activity. He had a mutual understanding with his friend that they're just friends, no emotional attachment. The friend offered a blowjob, and they had a few sessions. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the breakup, the activity resumed. The author then felt bad for only receiving, so he reciprocated once but felt awful and ended it. The friend got distant and isn't responding. Others said the author led him on, but he claims it was clear he's not interested in a relationship.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Both parties agreed to the arrangement initially. However, when the author reciprocated, he felt bad and stopped, which might have left the friend feeling rejected or confused. The friend's reaction could be due to feeling used or that their feelings were not respected. Even if there was no romantic intent, the sudden end after reciprocation might have caused emotional distress. The author might have not clearly communicated his boundaries from the start or after the reciprocity. Since both are 18, there's no legal issue, but emotionally, the friend might have felt the author was inconsistent. The author's actions could be seen as leading the friend on if there wasn't a clear, ongoing discussion about the nature of the relationship. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't maintain clear boundaries, leading to the friend's disappointment.\n"
