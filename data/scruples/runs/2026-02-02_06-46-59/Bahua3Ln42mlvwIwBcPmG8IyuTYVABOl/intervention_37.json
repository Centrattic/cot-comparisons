I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible person who had a one-sided sexual arrangement with a gay friend. Let's go through the points step by step.\n\nFirst, the author accepted blowjobs from his gay friend when he was single and then stopped when he got a girlfriend. That seems okay initially, but then he got dumped and resumed the activity. The key issue here is the power dynamic and mutual consent. The friend is gay, so maybe he has different needs or expectations. The author then decides to reciprocate, which makes him feel uncomfortable, leading him to end the arrangement. After that, the friend becomes distant and unresponsive.\n\nThe author's main defense is that he was clear about his orientation and didn't lead the friend on. However, the friend might have developed feelings or expected a more reciprocal relationship. Even if the author is straight, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend can create emotional complications. The fact that the friend is now avoiding him suggests that the author's actions caused hurt feelings, even if he didn't intend to lead on.\n\nThe author's actions might have been a betrayal of trust, especially since they were close friends. Even if the arrangement was consensual at first, the ongoing nature of it and the eventual refusal to reciprocate could have been hurtful. The friend might have felt used or that his affection wasn't respected. The author's response to the friend's hurt (sending a message over Christmas and getting a minimal reply) indicates that the friendship was damaged.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author may not have explicitly lied, but engaging in a sexual relationship that the friend might have hoped could evolve into something more (emotionally or romantically) could be seen as using the friend for physical needs without considering their emotional state. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating might have been abrupt and not communicated clearly, leading to the friend feeling rejected or devalued.\n\nSo, considering the friend's perspective and the impact on their friendship, the author might be at fault for not being honest about the nature of the relationship and for causing emotional harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
