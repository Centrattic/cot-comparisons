I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the scenario provided. The situation involves a straight/heteroflexible man and a gay friend who offered him blowjobs. The key points are the initial agreement, the continuation after the author's girlfriend dumps him, the author reciprocating but then feeling bad, and the resulting strain on their friendship.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as straight but is heteroflexible, which I think means he's open to same-sex experiences but not exclusively. The friend is explicitly gay. So the initial arrangement was a one-way sexual act. The author didn't reciprocate until after his girlfriend left, which led to guilt and stopping the arrangement. Now, the friend is distant.\n\nThe main ethical questions here are about consent, boundaries, and emotional impact. The author didn't have a romantic relationship with the friend; it was a mutual agreement, albeit one-sided. The problem arises when the author reciprocated, which made him uncomfortable and led to ending the arrangement. The friend's reaction is coldness and distance, which the author is upset about.\n\nFrom a perspective of consent, both parties agreed initially. However, the power dynamic and emotional investment might be unequal. The author's friend might have felt that the reciprocity was a sign of commitment or emotional connection, which the author wasn't willing to provide. The author's actions might have led the friend to believe there was a mutual romantic or emotional aspect, even if the author intended it to be just physical.\n\nAlso, after the author's girlfriend left, resuming the arrangement could lead to emotional complications, especially if the friend hoped for more. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have caused emotional harm, leading to the friend's current behavior.\n\nThe author argues that he was clear about his orientation and that it was a mutual agreement. However, in relationships, even if initially consensual, ongoing interactions can create expectations that aren't met when one party changes their stance. The author might have led the friend to believe there was more potential for a reciprocal relationship, especially after the friend reciprocated.\n\nIn terms of social norms and friendship, mixing romantic/sexual boundaries can complicate things. Even if both parties initially agreed, the act of reciprocating might have blurred those lines, making the friend feel rejected or used when the author ended it.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might have crossed a line by reciprocating and then ending the arrangement, even if the initial agreement was clear. The friend's hurt feelings are valid, and the author's actions, while consensual at first, may have caused emotional distress. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not maintaining clear boundaries and for the abrupt change after reciprocation, leading to the friend's withdrawal.\n"
