I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a straight guy who had a gay friend offering blowjobs. They had this arrangement for a while, then he got a girlfriend and they stopped. After the breakup, they started again, but then he felt bad and stopped because it made him feel sick. Now his friend is being cold and distant, and he's confused about whether he's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is gay, so maybe he's interested in a romantic or sexual relationship, but the author made it clear he's straight and not interested in that. The author seems to have been in a transactional arrangement where the friend was providing something the author wanted, but the author didn't reciprocate sexually. Then, when the author tried to reciprocate once, he felt awful and told the friend to stop. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. The author claims he was clear about his orientation and that there's no romantic interest. However, engaging in sexual acts, even if consensual, can create emotional dependencies or unmet expectations. The friend might have hoped for a more reciprocal or romantic relationship, which the author isn't offering. \n\nWhen the author tried to reciprocate, he felt bad and ended the arrangement. The friend's reaction of being cold and distant could be due to feeling rejected or unappreciated. Even if the author was clear about his orientation, the friend might still feel hurt or used. The author's actions of starting and stopping the arrangement, especially after getting a girlfriend and then resuming after the breakup, could be seen as leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe people in the other sub said it's the author's fault for leading the friend on. The author argues he didn't lead him on, but the friend might have interpreted the ongoing sexual relationship as a sign of interest beyond just physical. The author's decision to stop, while honest, might have left the friend feeling embarrassed or rejected. \n\nAlso, the fact that they're both 18 and friends complicates things. The author might have thought it was a casual arrangement, but the friend could have had deeper feelings. The author's messages after stopping might not have been sufficient to maintain the friendship without the sexual component, perhaps because the friendship was intertwined with that aspect. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author was honest about his orientation from the start, then maybe he's not at fault. But if the friend was under the impression that there was a chance for a romantic relationship, the author's actions could be seen as misleading. The author's main issue is that once the sexual part stopped, the friendship deteriorated, which suggests the friend's feelings might have been more involved than the author realized. \n\nIt's possible the author isn't in the wrong because he was clear about his boundaries and stopped when he felt uncomfortable. However, the friend's emotional response indicates that the dynamic might have been more emotionally charged for him. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of his actions, even if he was honest. So it's a bit of a gray area. But given the friend's perspective, the author could be seen as having contributed to the problem by not addressing the emotional aspects of their arrangement.\n"
