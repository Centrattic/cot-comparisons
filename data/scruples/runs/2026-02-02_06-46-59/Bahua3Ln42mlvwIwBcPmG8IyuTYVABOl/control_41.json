I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a straight guy who's friends with a gay friend. The gay friend offered him a blowjob, and he accepted. They did this for weeks or months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the sexual activity. Then the author felt bad about it and tried reciprocating, but felt awful and told his friend to stop. Now the friend is distant, and the author is confused because he thought he was clear about not being interested in a romantic or emotional relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heterosexual but open to some extent. The friend is gay, so he's interested in men. The author's actions involved engaging in sexual acts with his friend, which might be problematic because, even if both are adults, there could be issues of consent, emotional boundaries, and mutual understanding. But the author claims it was clear he wasn't interested in anything romantic, just physical. \n\nThe key points are: the author engaged in sexual activity with a friend, then stopped, which caused the friend to become distant. The author is now asking if he's at fault. The friend is gay, so maybe he had deeper feelings, and the author's actions might have led to emotional hurt. The author says he didn't lead him on, but the friend might have felt used or that the relationship was transactional. \n\nWhen the author reciprocated and then decided to stop, that might have made the friend feel rejected or that the author didn't consider his feelings. Even if the author was clear about not wanting to be in a relationship, the act of engaging in sexual activity could create an emotional bond or expectations. The friend might have felt that the author was only interested in physical gratification without emotional reciprocity, leading to feelings of disrespect or being taken advantage of. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were close friends before this and the author is now trying to reconnect might not be appreciated if the friend feels the previous interactions were one-sided. The author might not have considered how his actions affected his friend's emotional well-being, even if there was no romantic intention. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if both parties are adults and consented to the sexual activity, the underlying issue is the impact on the friendship. The author changed the dynamics of the friendship, and when he stopped, it left the friend in a difficult position. The friend's coldness could be a response to feeling used or unappreciated. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't fully consider his friend's emotional needs and might have contributed to the friend's hurt feelings by ending the arrangement without addressing it properly. Even if the author didn't intend to lead him on, the actions could have done so inadvertently. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
