I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves two male friends, both 18, where one is straight and the other is gay. The author, who identifies as heteroflexible, accepted a blowjob from his gay friend, then later broke it off when he felt uncomfortable. Now the friend is being cold and distant.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and communication. The friend offered, and the author agreed, so initially, there wasn't a problem. But when the author's relationship status changed (got a girlfriend, then broke up), they continued the arrangement. Then, when the author decided to stop, he explained it was because it wasn't what he was, which might have hurt the friend's feelings. The friend's reaction is now being cold, and the author is confused about the backlash.\n\nThe author claims he was clear about being straight and not wanting any emotional commitment. But even if the author didn't lead him on romantically, the friend might have developed feelings or felt used. The act of reciprocating (sucking the friend) and then immediately stopping might have been a sign of guilt or mixed signals. The author's decision to end the arrangement without considering the friend's feelings could have caused hurt, especially since the friend was acting out of affection or desire. \n\nEven if the author didn't have romantic intentions, the friend might have felt that their actions were being taken advantage of. The author might have failed to acknowledge the friend's feelings or communicate properly when ending the arrangement. The friend's response, though hurtful, might be a reaction to feeling rejected or unappreciated. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have been in the wrong by not considering the emotional impact of his actions on his friend. While the initial act was consensual, the ongoing dynamic and then abruptly stopping could have been careless. The author's friends in the sub said they led him on, which adds to the possibility that the author wasn't fully considerate of the friend's perspective. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friend's emotional attachment might have been overlooked. So, the author might be at fault for not handling the situation with more empathy and care.\n"
