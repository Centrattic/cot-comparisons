I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nFirst, the person is a straight, heteroflexible guy. He had a gay friend who offered him a blowjob, and they had this arrangement for a while. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Later, he tried to reciprocate but felt bad and told his friend they should stop. Now the friend is distant and unresponsive. The user is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The key points here are about consent, mutual understanding, and how the friendship was affected. The author claims he was clear from the start that he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. The friend initiated the sexual activity, and they engaged in a consensual arrangement. But after the author ended it, the friend became upset.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The friend might have had hopes for more, but the author maintained that it was just a sexual arrangement. However, the act of reciprocating and then pulling away might have confused the friend. Also, the author's actions could have led to emotional distress for the friend, especially if the friend saw this as a form of intimacy beyond just physical.\n\nBut the author did communicate his intentions, even after the girlfriend ended. When he felt uncomfortable about reciprocating, he clearly stated they should stop. The friend's reaction is coldness and withdrawal, which is his own response. The author is now trying to mend the friendship but is met with resistance. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the actions were consensual and with clear boundaries, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the friend's emotional state is a factor. If the author's actions made the friend feel used or unappreciated, that could be a point against him. But the author didn't force anything; it was initiated by the friend each time, and he stopped it once he felt uncomfortable.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend is gay, so engaging in sexual activity with a straight friend might not be reciprocated in the same way. The friend might have felt a sense of imbalance or unrequited affection. The author's decision to stop might have been necessary for his own comfort, even if it upset the friend.\n\nBut the main question is about wrongdoing. Since the author was honest about his orientation and boundaries, and the friend was the one who initiated the sexual acts, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the way he ended it might have been abrupt, but he tried to communicate it nicely. The friend's reaction is his own issue, perhaps stemming from unmet expectations or emotional investment.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the consensual nature and clear communication from the author's side, he might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
