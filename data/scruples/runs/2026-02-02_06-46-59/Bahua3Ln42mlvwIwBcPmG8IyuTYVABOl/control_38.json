I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped it, leading to the friend becoming distant. The key points here are consent, communication, and the impact on the friendship.\n\nFirst, the author and his friend agreed to the arrangement from the start. Both were adults (18), and it was consensual. The friend was aware the author is straight and that there's no romantic interest. So initially, there's no coercion or manipulation. However, when the author's girlfriend dumps him, they resume the arrangement. Then, the author feels guilty and stops, which the friend isn't happy about.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is at fault for ending the arrangement. Since they had an understanding from the beginning that it was purely sexual and the author isn't interested romantically, the friend might have hoped for something more or felt used. The author tried to communicate his feelings and ended it respectfully. The friend's reaction is hurt, but does that make the author wrong? \n\nThe friend's behavior after the breakup is cold, which suggests he might have had deeper feelings or felt discarded. However, the author didn't lead him on; he was clear about his orientation and boundaries. The friend chose to engage despite knowing the terms. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't in the wrong because he acted within the agreed-upon boundaries, communicated his feelings when he decided to stop, and there was no deceit. The friend's reaction is unfortunate, but the author isn't obligated to maintain the arrangement if it makes him uncomfortable. The advice from others that he should leave the friend alone might be harsh, but the author isn't the one violating any boundaries here. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He maintained clear communication and respected his own feelings and boundaries.\n"
