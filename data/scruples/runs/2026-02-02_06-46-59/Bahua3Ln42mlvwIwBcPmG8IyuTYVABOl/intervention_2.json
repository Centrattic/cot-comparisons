I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the scenario they provided. So, first, I need to break down the key points.\n\nThe author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. They engaged in blowjobs for several months. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. After a breakup, the activity resumed. Later, the author reciprocated but felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. Now, the friend is distant and unresponsive, leading the author to question if they're at fault.\n\nFrom the start, the author acknowledges he's straight and heteroflexible, but the friend is gay. So, the friend might have had affectionate feelings or hoped for a romantic connection. The author didn't clarify the arrangement's nature beyond physical acts, which could lead to misunderstandings. Even if the author wasn't interested romantically, the friend might have felt used or emotionally hurt when the author ended it, especially after reciprocation. The friend's coldness suggests hurt feelings. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have led to emotional harm. The key here is whether the author was clear about the arrangement's boundaries and if the friend consented to a purely physical relationship without expectations. If the author was upfront and the friend agreed, maybe it's less the author's fault. But if the friend had unspoken expectations, the author could be seen as leading them on. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have added to the friend's confusion. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for not managing boundaries better and potentially causing emotional harm.\n"
