I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a friend, who's gay, offer to give him blowjobs. The author is heteroflexible, so he's into guys sometimes but not into relationships with them. They did this a few times when he was single, then stopped when he got a girlfriend. After the girlfriend dumped him, they started again, and then the author decided to reciprocate, which made him uncomfortable, so he ended the arrangement. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is confused because he thought he was clear that he didn't have romantic feelings.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he engaged in sexual activity with a friend, which is a big deal. The friend is gay, so maybe he's looking for more than just a casual arrangement, but the author is straight/straight-leaning. The problem arises when the author starts to reciprocate, which makes him feel bad, and he ends the relationship. The friend is upset, and the author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider consent and communication. The author said from the start that he's not interested in a romantic relationship, which the friend was okay with. But maybe the friend had different expectations, even if he was okay with the initial arrangement. The author might have given mixed signals by engaging in the relationship and then stopping, especially after reciprocating. When he reciprocated, maybe the friend thought there was a mutual connection or deeper interest, but the author felt guilty and ended it, which could have left the friend feeling used or rejected.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is being distant. The author tried to reach out but wasn't getting a good response. The people in the sub said it's his fault for leading the friend on. Even if he was clear about his intentions, the act of engaging in a sexual relationship might have created emotional attachment or expectations on the friend's side that the author didn't fulfill. The author might have not considered the emotional impact of their actions, even if they were consensual.\n\nAnother angle: both are 18, so they're young. Maybe they didn't fully understand the implications of their actions. The author might have thought it was just a casual thing, but the friend might have felt more attached. The author's decision to reciprocate and then back away could have been confusing for the friend, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for not maintaining consistent communication and for not considering how his actions affect the friend emotionally. Even if the initial arrangement was clear, the ongoing dynamic might have evolved in ways the author didn't anticipate. Ending the relationship after reciprocation might have been abrupt or emotionally jarring for the friend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably did do something wrong by engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend who might have had different expectations, and then ending it in a way that left the friend feeling hurt. Even if the author was clear about his lack of romantic interest, the actions could have led to emotional consequences. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
