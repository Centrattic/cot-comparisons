I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a friend offer blowjobs, and they engaged in that over some time. Then when the friend got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed. The friend then tried to reciprocate, felt bad, and ended things. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is confused about whether he's the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are consent, communication, and the impact on the friendship. The author mentions that he's straight and never led the friend to believe there was romantic interest. However, engaging in sexual acts, even if one-sided, can create emotional and psychological expectations or attachments. The friend might have felt that the relationship had a certain level of intimacy or mutual interest beyond just physical acts, especially since they were close friends.\n\nThe author stopped reciprocating after feeling uncomfortable, which he communicated. But maybe the friend felt used or that the relationship became transactional. The author's actions might have made the friend feel that the friendship was conditional on the sexual acts. Even if there was no explicit romantic intent, the friend might have developed feelings or expectations that weren't met, leading to hurt and distance.\n\nAlso, the author's initial acceptance of the sexual acts without considering the friend's emotional needs could be problematic. The friend might have been seeking affection or connection beyond the physical, and the author's withdrawal could have felt like rejection. The author's attempts to maintain the friendship afterward might not be enough if the foundation of trust and mutual respect was undermined.\n\nIt's important to note that both parties are 18, so they're adults and can make their own choices. However, the issue here is about how their actions affected each other. The author might be in the wrong for not being more attentive to the friend's emotional state and for creating a situation where the friend felt unappreciated or used, even if that wasn't the intention. Clear communication is key in any relationship, and if the author didn't address the friend's feelings adequately, that could be a problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, while the author might not have malicious intent, his actions could have harmed the friendship. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. The answer would be A, as the author's actions led to the friend feeling hurt and distant, even if unintentionally.\n"
