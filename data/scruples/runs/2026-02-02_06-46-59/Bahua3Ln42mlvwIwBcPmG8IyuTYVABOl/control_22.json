I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male. He had a close gay friend who offered him a blowjob. He accepted, and they did this several times over weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, and when she dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. The author then felt bad and reciprocated, but immediately regretted it, told his friend to stop, and now the friend is cold. The author is confused because others say he led the friend on, but he claims it was clear he's straight.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether the author's actions led the friend to believe there was a romantic or emotional connection beyond just a sexual arrangement. The author says it was clear he's not interested romantically, but the friend kept offering and they continued the relationship. Then when the author tried to reciprocate and later stop, the friend got upset.\n\nI need to consider consent and mutual understanding. If the friend knew the author was straight and that this was purely physical, then maybe it's more about the author's change in behavior causing hurt. But if there was any ambiguity, like the friend might have hoped for more, then the author could be at fault for not being clear.\n\nAlso, when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, which suggests there was an agreement to not engage when he was in a relationship. But when the author got dumped, he resumed, which might be seen as taking advantage of the friend's feelings or the situation. Then, after reciprocating and deciding to stop, the friend felt rejected or led on, leading to the cold treatment.\n\nAnother angle is the communication. The author said they were \"very good friends\" and did stuff together. If the friend felt that the sexual relationship was part of the friendship, and the author then reciprocated and then stopped, it could have been hurtful. The author didn't handle the end of the arrangement smoothly, leading to the friend's distance.\n\nBut others might argue that the author was honest about his orientation and that the friend knew the boundaries. However, the act of reciprocating might have given the friend false hope, even if brief. The author's immediate regret and stopping could indicate he wasn't comfortable, but the friend might have felt used or that the author was fickle.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author didn't mislead the friend about his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the friend expected more than casual and the author didn't communicate that clearly, then the author might be at fault for not setting clear boundaries from the start.\n\nAlso, the age factor\u2014both are 18. It's legal, but the dynamics of close friends might complicate things. The key is whether there was an understanding that this was purely physical and not based on any romantic interest. If the friend took it personally, the author might need to acknowledge that even if he didn't intend to lead on, the actions still hurt the friend.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author may have been in the wrong if he didn't clearly communicate that this was a casual, non-romantic arrangement, leading the friend to hope for something more. Even if he thought it was clear, the friend's reaction suggests that he felt led on. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not maintaining clear boundaries and for the abrupt change in their dynamic, causing the friend emotional distress.\n"
