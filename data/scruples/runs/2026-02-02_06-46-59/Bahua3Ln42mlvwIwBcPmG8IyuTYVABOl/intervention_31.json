I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight-identifying male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then later ended it, leading to a strained friendship.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author describes himself as \"heteroflexible,\" meaning he's open to same-sex encounters but primarily straight. His friend is gay and offered oral sex, which the author accepted. They continued this for a while, then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After being dumped, they resumed, and when the author reciprocated, he felt uncomfortable and ended the arrangement. Now, the friend is distant, and others say the author is at fault for leading him on.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The author was explicit about his sexual orientation from the start, so the friend knew he wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. However, the act of engaging in sexual activity with someone who isn't interested in a reciprocal relationship can be seen as exploiting the friend's affection. Even if the author clarifies he isn't interested romantically, the friend might still have developed feelings or felt used. \n\nThe author's decision to reciprocate and then end the arrangement could have caused emotional harm. The friend's reaction\u2014becoming cold and distant\u2014suggests he felt hurt or rejected. The author might not have considered the emotional impact, especially since the friend is gay and might have had deeper feelings. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, could have been insensitive to the friend's emotional state. \n\nOthers' opinions suggest that the author led the friend on, which might be true if the friend interpreted the interaction as a form of affection or potential romantic interest. The author's lack of awareness about the friend's emotional needs and the abrupt ending of the arrangement could contribute to the friend's feelings of being used. \n\nIn terms of social ethics, maintaining honesty and considering the emotional well-being of others is crucial. Even if the author was clear about his intentions, the ongoing sexual relationship without a romantic context might have been confusing or hurtful. The author's responsibility includes understanding how his actions affect others, even if he doesn't share the same feelings. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps not intentionally harmful, likely caused emotional distress to a friend who had feelings for him. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the friend's emotional needs and for not handling the situation with more sensitivity.\n"
