I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight man who engaged in oral sex with a gay friend, then later stopped when he got a girlfriend and after a breakup. Now the friend is acting cold, and the author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend is gay, so the author's actions might have been inconsiderate. The author was clear about being straight and not interested romantically, but engaging in sexual activity could still be problematic. The friend might have felt used or that the relationship was one-sided, especially if he was hoping for more emotional connection. Also, the fact that they're both 18 is important because legally, they're adults, but emotionally, such situations can be complex.\n\nThe author stopped the arrangement after feeling guilty about the one-time reciprocal act. That shows some self-awareness. However, the friend's reaction of becoming distant suggests he felt hurt or disrespected. The author tried to reach out, but the friend didn't respond warmly. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author might have been leading the friend on, even if he wasn't romantically interested. The friend's motivation for offering the oral sex could have been emotional or romantic, which the author didn't reciprocate. This could be seen as exploiting the friend's feelings for personal gratification without emotional reciprocity. \n\nThe fact that the author continued the arrangement even after getting a girlfriend and then resumed after a breakup might have made the situation more complex. The friend might feel that the author used him during times of personal turmoil (single, then dumped), which isn't respectful.\n\nThe author's attempt to explain that it was clear they were straight might not matter if the friend felt manipulated. The key issue here is the power dynamic and the emotional impact on the friend. Even if there was no explicit agreement, the friend might have hoped for more, and the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of that.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have been more mindful of the friend's potential feelings and the nature of their relationship. While the author didn't force the friend, the act of accepting and then stopping without addressing the friend's emotional needs might have been hurtful. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is at fault because the actions, though not necessarily illegal, were inconsiderate and may have led to the friend feeling used, even if the author didn't intend to lead them on. The friend's reaction is a valid response to feeling disrespected.\n"
