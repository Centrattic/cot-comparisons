I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a straight, heteroflexible male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then ended it after getting a girlfriend, resumed after the relationship ended, and then stopped again when he felt uncomfortable. Now the friend is being distant, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author started a sexual relationship with a friend who is gay. The friend initiated it, and the author participated, knowing the friend's orientation. Then, when the author had a girlfriend, they stopped, but resumed after the breakup. The author then reciprocated, felt bad, and ended the relationship, leading to distance from the friend.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and mutual understanding. The friend is gay, so he might have had romantic or emotional feelings, while the author is straight and only interested in casual sex. Even though the author said they were clear about not being in love, the repeated sexual encounters might have given the friend hope for a deeper connection. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop could have caused emotional hurt, even if there was no explicit agreement on the nature of the relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's actions of resuming the relationship after a breakup might have been a way to cope with emotional distress, which could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's feelings. Even if the author didn't intend to lead the friend on, the friend's emotional response suggests that he felt attached. The author's subsequent distancing might have made it worse, even if he tried to explain his actions.\n\nHowever, the author did try to communicate his boundaries when he reciprocated and realized his discomfort. The friend's reaction could stem from feeling used or unappreciated, especially if he saw it as a one-sided arrangement. The author might have failed to recognize the emotional impact of his actions, even if they were consensual.\n\nIn terms of social norms, having a sexual relationship with a friend can create complications, especially when one person's feelings differ. The author's honesty about his orientation is a point in his favor, but the ongoing dynamic without clear emotional boundaries might have led to the friend feeling hurt.\n\nConsidering all this, the author did have a choice to participate in the relationship knowing the friend's sexuality. Even if there was no romantic intent, the friend's emotional investment and the subsequent rejection could make the author complicit in hurting the friend's feelings. The author's actions of using the friend for sexual purposes without considering the emotional consequences might make him at fault, even if unintentional.\n"
