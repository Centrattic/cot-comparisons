I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible man who had a close friendship with a gay friend. The friend offered to give the author a blowjob, and the author accepted. They continued this arrangement for weeks or months. Then, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, but after a breakup, they resumed. The author then reciprocated by giving the friend a blowjob but felt bad and ended the arrangement. Now, the friend is cold and distant, and the author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement, and there was no indication of coercion. The author made it clear they weren't interested in a romantic relationship. However, when the author reciprocated and then decided to stop, it might have caused emotional distress to the friend. The friend's reaction\u2014becoming distant and unresponsive\u2014suggests hurt feelings, possibly from the sudden change in the dynamic after forming a connection. \n\nEven though the author tried to communicate their discomfort, the act of reciprocating might have led the friend to hope for a deeper or mutual relationship, which the author was not interested in. The author's decision to end the arrangement after reciprocating could be seen as breaking trust or leading the friend on, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe author's confusion arises from not understanding why the friend is upset, thinking they were clear about their intentions. However, in close friendships with physical intimacy, boundaries can sometimes be misinterpreted. The author's actions might have created ambiguity, leading to emotional harm. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not fully considering the emotional implications of their actions on the friend. Even though they were clear about their orientation, the physical interactions could have caused the friend to form emotional attachments that were then severed without proper care. The author's responsibility includes acknowledging the impact of their decisions on the friend's feelings, even if the initial actions were consensual.\n"
