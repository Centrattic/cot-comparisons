I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a straight male who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then stopped it when he got a girlfriend. After the breakup, they resumed, and when the author felt bad and ended it, the friend became distant.\n\nFirst, the author engaged in a sexual relationship with a friend. The friend is gay, so he's the one initiating the relationship. The author is straight but heteroflexible. The key points here are consent and communication. Initially, both parties agreed to the arrangement. However, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped, which seems respectful. Then, after the breakup, they resumed. \n\nProblem arises when the author, after feeling guilty, decides to stop again. The friend becomes cold. The author claims he never led the friend on, clarifying his orientation. Others on a sub said it's his fault for leading on, but the author argues he was clear.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is responsible for the friend's hurt feelings. Even if the author was clear about his orientation, the ongoing sexual relationship might have created emotional attachment on the friend's side. The author ended it suddenly, which might have caused emotional distress. The friend's reaction is understandable if he developed feelings beyond the sexual aspect. \n\nAlso, considering they're both 18, it's possible they're new to such relationships. The author's decision to reciprocate and then stop might have confused the friend. Even if the author acted within his boundaries, the abrupt ending without addressing the friend's emotions could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author didn't lie about his orientation, he might not have fully considered the emotional impact of ending the relationship. The friend's withdrawal suggests he felt rejected or hurt. The author's attempts to reconnect are met with coldness, indicating the friendship is damaged. \n\nSo, the author's actions, while not malicious, may have caused unintended harm. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful throughout. Since they had a mutual agreement initially, but the author's sudden withdrawal without addressing the emotional aspect might be seen as inconsiderate. Hence, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the end of the relationship more sensitively.\n"
