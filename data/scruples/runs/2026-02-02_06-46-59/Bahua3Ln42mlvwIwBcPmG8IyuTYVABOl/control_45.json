I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4.

A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. So first, I need to analyze the details provided.\n\nThe author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author accepted. They did this several times over weeks or months. Then the author got a girlfriend, and they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. The author then reciprocated, felt uncomfortable, and told the friend they should stop. Now the friend is acting cold and distant. The author is confused because he thought he was clear about his boundaries and didn't lead the friend on, but others say it's his fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author acknowledges he's straight, and the friend is gay. The key issue might be consent and mutual understanding from the start. The author says it was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, engaging in sexual acts with someone, even if it's clear there's no romantic intent, can still lead to emotional complications, especially if one party becomes attached or feels used. \n\nThe friend might have felt that the sexual encounters were part of a mutual, consensual arrangement. When the author reciprocated, maybe there was an expectation of reciprocity or a deeper connection. Then the author stops, which could lead to feelings of rejection or being devalued. Even if the author didn't lead on, the act of accepting the friend's advances and then stopping could be hurtful. The friend's cold response suggests he might feel betrayed or disrespected, despite the author trying to be polite when ending things.\n\nAnother angle is the context of their friendship. The author mentions they were close friends who did a lot together. Introducing a sexual element might have shifted the dynamic, and when the author ended it, the friend might have felt the friendship was compromised. The author might not have considered how ending the sexual encounters would impact the friendship, especially since the friend was the one initiating it. \n\nAlso, the author's decision to reciprocate once and then stop could be seen as a mixed signal. Even though he felt sick afterward and communicated stopping, the act of participating in the other direction might have confused the friend or created an expectation that the author wasn't ready for. \n\nThe opinions from others suggesting it's the author's fault for leading on might stem from the idea that even with clear boundaries, the friendship's foundation was altered. The author might not have been aware of the emotional weight the friend placed on the encounters. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author did stop when he felt uncomfortable and tried to maintain the friendship. However, the friend's reaction indicates that the author's actions had a significant negative impact. The question is whether the author had the right to change the arrangement without considering the friend's feelings or if the friend overreacted. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because, even with clear communication, the sexual acts could have created an unspoken expectation of continued interaction. The friend's withdrawal might stem from feeling rejected after a period of intimacy. The author's actions, while not malicious, may have disregarded the friend's emotional investment in the relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
