I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves a straight-identified person engaging in oral sex with a gay friend, then things cooling down when the author gets a girlfriend, and then resuming when the girlfriend dumps them. The author stops the friend and then the friend becomes distant. The author is confused because others say it's their fault for leading the friend on, but the author claims it was clear they were straight and not into a romantic relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is heteroflexible, which might mean they're open to same-sex interactions but identify as straight. The friend is gay, so he's likely interested in more than just a one-sided sexual relationship. The author's actions might have given the friend false hope that there could be a romantic or emotional connection, even if the author never intended that. \n\nWhen the author starts a sexual relationship with the friend, especially while single, and then later gets a girlfriend, they stop the arrangement. But when the girlfriend dumps them, the author resumes the sexual activity. This resumption could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's feelings, especially if the friend thought there was potential for more. \n\nThen, the author decides to reciprocate and has a change of heart, which leads to the friend becoming distant. The author is confused because they think they were clear about their orientation and didn't lead the friend on. However, the friend might have interpreted the sexual encounters as a sign of mutual interest or affection beyond the physical. \n\nThe key points here are consent and clear communication. The author claims it was clear they were straight, but actions can sometimes communicate more than words. The friend might have felt that the author was interested in a romantic or deeper emotional connection, which the author never intended. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have been perceived as rejection or betrayal, leading to the friend's coldness.\n\nEven if the author was honest about their orientation, engaging in a sexual relationship with someone who is interested in more than that can create emotional complications. The author might have not considered the friend's feelings or the potential for emotional attachment, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe fact that the author's actions led to the friend feeling used or manipulated, even if unintentionally, suggests that there's a responsibility to consider the other person's perspective. The author might not have realized the depth of the friend's feelings, leading to the current situation where the friend is distant. \n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to lead the friend on, their actions could have created a situation where the friend felt they were being taken advantage of or that there was potential for a relationship that wasn't reciprocal. The author's responsibility to communicate clearly and consider the friend's feelings is crucial here. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
