I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a straight guy who had a gay friend offer to give him blowjobs. He accepted, and they did it a few times. Then he got a girlfriend, they stopped, but when the girlfriend dumped him, they started again. Later, he felt bad and tried to reciprocate, but didn't like it and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is confused about whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the author is heteroflexible, which means he might be open to some same-sex encounters but not into it long-term. The friend is gay, so he's likely into guys. The key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't force the friend; the friend offered the service. But when the author started reciprocating and then stopped, that might have made the friend feel rejected or used. \n\nThe author's main issue is that he didn't set clear boundaries from the start. Even though he says he was clear about being straight, the ongoing arrangement might have led the friend to hope for more or feel invested. When the author stopped, it could be hurtful. Also, the friend's reaction is understandable if he felt used or if the author's actions led to emotional attachment that wasn't mutual.\n\nThe author canceled the friendship after being friends for a while, which the friend is now reacting to. Even if the author didn't have romantic intentions, the friend might have developed feelings or felt that the relationship changed. The author should have considered the friend's feelings when ending the physical relationship, especially since they were close friends before. The fact that others said he's leading the friend on suggests that his actions might have been ambiguous. So, maybe the author is at fault for not being clear and for causing emotional harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
