I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a straight guy who had a sexual arrangement with a gay friend, then when he got a girlfriend they stopped. After the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. Then the author felt bad about it, reciprocated once, and then ended it. Now the friend is being cold, and the author is confused about his role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is heterosexual and heteroflexible, but engaging in a sexual act with a friend who identifies as gay. The friend offered, and the author accepted. The problem arises when the author starts a romantic relationship, then resumes the arrangement after the breakup. The author then reciprocates once, feels bad, and ends the arrangement, leading to the friend's withdrawal.\n\nFrom the friend's perspective, being in a situation where he's performing an act for someone who isn't romantically interested might be emotionally challenging. Even if the author clarifies his orientation, the act itself might make the friend feel used or unreciprocated. The author's decision to reciprocate once might have been confusing for the friend, especially if it felt like a step towards a romantic or more balanced relationship, which the author then rejects. This could lead to feelings of rejection or being led on, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author's actions might have been inconsistent from the friend's viewpoint. Starting, stopping, resuming, and then ending the arrangement could be seen as emotionally manipulative. Even if the author thought it was clear, the friend might have developed feelings or expectations that weren't met. The author's friend's reaction of distancing and coldness suggests hurt feelings, which the author might have caused by not being considerate of the friend's emotional state.\n\nThe key points here are consent and emotional impact. While the acts were consensual, the ongoing arrangement might have created emotional dependency or unmet expectations on the friend's side. The author's friend might feel that the author wasn't honest about his intentions or that the author took advantage of his affection. The author's own confusion about his role and the friend's reaction indicates that there was a lack of clear communication or consideration of the friend's feelings beyond the physical aspect.\n\nIn social interactions, especially in friendships, emotional reciprocity and respect are important. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, may have overlooked the emotional toll on the friend. Ending the arrangement without considering the friend's perspective could be seen as selfish, even if the author had his reasons. The friend's withdrawal is a natural response to feeling used or unappreciated.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions likely contributed to the friend's hurt feelings. Even if the author didn't intend to lead him on, the pattern of behavior and the eventual reciprocation followed by rejection could be damaging. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
