I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible guy. He had a close friend who's gay and offered him a blowjob. The author accepted, and they continued this a few times over weeks/months. Then he got a girlfriend, and they stopped. The girlfriend dumped him, so they started again. Eventually, the author felt bad about the one-sided arrangement and reciprocated, but then felt awful and told his friend they should stop. After that, the friend became cold and distant. The author tried to reach out, but the friend was unresponsive. He's confused because others say he led the friend on, but he claims he was clear about his sexuality and the arrangement was mutual.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, communication, and the impact on the friendship. The author and his friend were both adults (18), and the sexual activity was consensual. The author didn't initiate it; his friend offered first. Also, when the author felt uncomfortable with the one-sidedness, he tried to reciprocate but realized it wasn't right for him and ended the arrangement. The friend's reaction was to become distant, which is a bit unclear why. \n\nBut the problem comes from the idea of leading on. The author argues he was clear he's straight and not interested in a romantic relationship. However, by engaging in the sexual acts, even if they were mutual, it's possible the friend developed emotional attachment or felt used once the author stopped. The author ended the arrangement, which might have hurt the friend's feelings, especially if there's an unspoken expectation of reciprocity or emotional connection that wasn't there. \n\nThe author is now trying to maintain the friendship but the friend is pulling away. Others suggested it's his fault for leading on, which could be because the sexual acts, while consensual, might have created emotional expectations that weren't met. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on his friend, even if he was clear about his intentions. \n\nSo, while the author didn't force anything and tried to communicate when he felt it was wrong, the act of engaging in the sexual relationship might have been emotionally manipulative or unbalanced. The friend might have hoped for more, even if it wasn't expressed. The author's actions could have caused emotional harm, making him at least partially responsible for the friend's current feelings. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not recognizing the potential emotional consequences despite the clarity of their initial understanding.\n"
