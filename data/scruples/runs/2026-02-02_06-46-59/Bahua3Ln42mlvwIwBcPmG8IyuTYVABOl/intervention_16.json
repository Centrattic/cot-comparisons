I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two 18-year-old males where one, the author, is straight and heteroflexible, and the other is gay. They had a sexual arrangement where the gay friend gave blowjobs to the author. Later, when the author started a relationship, they stopped. After a breakup, they resumed the arrangement until the author felt uncomfortable and ended it, leading to the friend becoming distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. The author is clear about being straight and not interested in a romantic or physical relationship beyond certain boundaries. However, engaging in sexual acts with a friend, even if one party is gay and the other is heteroflexible, can lead to complications. The friend might have emotional feelings that are hurt when the relationship suddenly stops, especially if the author didn't communicate clearly or considered the friend's feelings.\n\nThe author mentions that they were clear from the start about not being in love or wanting a romantic relationship, but the friend might have developed feelings over time or felt manipulated. The act of the author reciprocating once, even if he felt bad afterward, might have confused the friend's expectations. Ending the arrangement abruptly could have caused emotional distress, leading to the cold response.\n\nAlso, the author is concerned about losing a close friendship. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. If both were okay with the arrangement initially and it was mutual, maybe the issue arises when the author ends it without considering the friend's emotional state. However, the author had the right to change his mind, but the way it was handled might have been abrupt.\n\nSome might argue that the author led the friend on by continuing the arrangement even after the friend might have had deeper feelings. Others might say the author was honest about his orientation and ended it when it felt uncomfortable. The friend's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe he felt used or that his affection wasn't respected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author might be in the wrong if he didn't consider the friend's emotional well-being when ending the arrangement, especially if the friend had expectations beyond just a sexual relationship. But if the author was clear and ended it respectfully, maybe he's not. However, the friend's distress suggests that the author's actions had an impact, even if unintentional.\n\nSo, based on the analysis, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he might have not been considerate enough of his friend's feelings when ending the arrangement, leading to the friend feeling rejected or hurt. Alternatively, it could be B if the author acted within his rights to set boundaries. But given the friend's reaction and the fact that the author continued the arrangement after getting a girlfriend and then broke up, it's possible that the author's actions were seen as manipulative, even if not intended. So leaning towards A.\n"
