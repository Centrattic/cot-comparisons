I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong in this situation. Let me look at the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a straight, heteroflexible male who had a gay friend. The friend offered a blowjob, and the author agreed. They did this several times until the author got a girlfriend. Then, after the girlfriend dumped him, they resumed the arrangement. The author then felt bad and reciprocated, but immediately regretted it and told the friend to stop. Now the friend is distant, and others say the author is at fault for leading him on, even though the author claims it was clear they're straight and not interested romantically.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, communication, and the nature of the relationship. Initially, both parties agreed to a sexual arrangement. The author was upfront about being straight and having no romantic feelings. The issue arises when the author reciprocated once and then stopped. The friend's reaction to the author's change of heart might stem from feeling rejected or used. Even though the author didn't lead on with romantic intentions, the friend might have developed emotional attachments or felt the arrangement was unfair (always giving, not receiving). The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have made the friend feel devalued. The author's responsibility here might be in not managing the friend's expectations or not considering the emotional impact. However, the friend's reaction seems extreme, possibly due to unmet emotional needs. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the situation's complexity lies in the friendship dynamics. Ultimately, the author acted on their own discomfort and set limits, which is valid. The friend's coldness is more about his reaction to rejection, but the author's actions were honest and respectful. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
