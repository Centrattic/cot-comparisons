I'm a straight heteroflexible dude btw.\n\n1. A gay friend, who I'm very good friends with, offered me a blowjob and since I was single and horny at the time I said ok\n\n2. I let him blow me quite a few times over the coming weeks/months\n\n3. I got a girlfriend at some point, then we stopped this arrangement and he was cool with it.\n\n4. My girlfriend dumped me and we started the BJ stuff again\n\n5. A few weeks ago I felt bad for him always doing it to me so I sucked him but I immediately felt awful and sick with myself and I told him nicely (not in a mean way) that this wasn't what I am and we should stop\n\n6. Since then he's been cold and distant to me. I texted him a huge message over Chrismas and he just replied \"thanks you too\" essentially. Every time I try to organize something to do with him, like we used to do before this stuff began, he just says he's busy.\n\n7. I asked people in a different sub and they said it's my fault for leading him on... but I didn't, it was clear from the start that I'm straight and wouldn't love him or kiss him or anything like that. They said I should leave him alone but how can I do that when he's like my best friend and we did so much stuff together? \n\nAm I really the bad guy here? PS we're both 18 male\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. The author is a straight, heteroflexible male who engaged in a sexual arrangement with a gay friend. They had oral sex a few times when the author was single and then stopped when the author got a girlfriend. After the breakup, the activity resumed, but the author decided to stop again, leading to a conflict where the friend became distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. The initial acts were consensual and both parties agreed. The friend offered, and the author accepted. There's no indication of coercion here.\n\nThen, when the author got a girlfriend, they stopped. That's a responsible move, avoiding any potential emotional issues. But when the girlfriend dumped him, the activity resumed. It's important to note that the author was clear from the start about being straight and not having romantic feelings. The friend knew the boundaries.\n\nThe author then felt guilty after reciprocating, which led to ending things again. The friend's reaction was to become distant. The author tried to reach out but was met with short replies. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author led the friend on. The author claims it was clear they weren't interested romantically. However, engaging in a sexual relationship, even with clear boundaries, can create expectations. The friend might have hoped for a deeper connection or felt used. The author ended it abruptly after reciprocating, which could have caused hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, the author's confusion as to how they're at fault suggests they might not see the emotional impact of their actions. Even if the acts were consensual, the friend's feelings and the subsequent distance indicate that the friendship was affected. The author might not have considered the friend's emotional state or the potential for the friend to feel objectified or rejected.\n\nIn relationships, even non-romantic, communication and emotional reciprocity matter. The author may have crossed a line by continuing the arrangement without considering the friend's feelings, especially when the friend is gay and might have had deeper emotional investment. The author's decision to stop after reciprocating could have been seen as a rejection, which is painful.\n\nSo, while the initial actions were consensual, the ongoing and then abrupt ending might be where the fault lies. The author didn't maintain a consistent boundary and might have contributed to the friend's hurt. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
