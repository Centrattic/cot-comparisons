They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch, and the author explained their stance. The MIL was taken aback, and the rest of the family made jokes about the author's \"liberal ideologies.\" The author ended up letting their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a valid reason for not eating there, based on their values. They communicated their reasons respectfully when asked. The in-laws were visiting, and the MIL had been looking forward to this. The author's main conflict is between personal convictions and family dynamics.\n\nThe author didn't force anyone else to not eat; they allowed their son to have the food. The issue is their own refusal, which caused discomfort. The wife's family made jokes, which might indicate a clash in values. The author's actions are based on their beliefs, but it's creating tension in the family setting.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they stood by their convictions without being confrontational. However, refusing to eat during family time might be seen as causing awkwardness. But it's also about personal ethics. The author didn't make others uncomfortable directly; they addressed the question when asked. The in-laws' reactions and the wife's family's jokes might be part of the problem too. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, it's about whether the author overstepped. Since they didn't impose their views on others and explained their stance when asked, they might not be the asshole. The family's reaction could be part of the issue. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
