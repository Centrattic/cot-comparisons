They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of their donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's in-laws are visiting, and the mother-in-law is excited to eat there. The author refuses because of the company's support of anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch, but the author won't eat there, which makes the family situation awkward. The wife's family made jokes about the author's \"liberal ideologies.\" The author allows the son to eat the food but not themselves.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has the right to support causes they believe in. It's their choice, and supporting LGBTQ rights is a valid stance. On the other hand, the family gathering might have been affected by this refusal. The in-laws might have felt disrespected or that their choice was being criticized. The author's actions could have caused tension, especially if the in-laws didn't understand the reasoning.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on a moral stance. They explained their position and allowed their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise. The issue is whether refusing to eat at a restaurant due to its donations is reasonable in a family setting. Some might argue it's a personal choice and not their place to judge, while others might see it as standing up for one's beliefs.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by making the lunch awkward for the family. The in-laws were just trying to enjoy a visit and a meal. The author's refusal could be seen as imposing their views on the family, but they did try to explain their reasoning. The fact that the author let their son eat the food suggests they weren't entirely against the meal, just the company's donations.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about causing unnecessary conflict. If the author's refusal is based on a genuine, informed belief and they're not forcing others to follow, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they caused discomfort without considering the family's feelings, that's where it's debatable. The answer might depend on cultural context and how the situation was handled. Since the author tried to explain and made a compromise, it's possible they aren't in the wrong. But if the refusal was the main reason for the awkwardness, maybe they are. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they stood by their convictions while allowing others to partake.\n"
