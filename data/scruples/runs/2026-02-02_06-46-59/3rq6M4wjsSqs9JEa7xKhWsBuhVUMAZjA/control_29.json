They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for refusing to eat Chick-fil-A during a family visit. The in-laws are conservative and wanted to treat everyone to lunch. The author explained their stance against Chick-fil-A's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws were confused and made some jokes about the author's liberal views. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author has a right to their beliefs and values. They're choosing not to support companies that fund anti-LGBTQ groups, which is a valid personal choice. On the other hand, the in-laws wanted to have a family meal, and the author's refusal might have caused tension, especially since the MIL was excited about it.\n\nThe key points here are personal convictions versus family dynamics. The author stood by their principles, which is commendable. However, the situation might have been more sensitive because it's a family gathering. The author could have tried to find a compromise, like suggesting an alternative restaurant, but they didn't. However, the in-laws were the ones who chose Chick-fil-A and wanted to treat everyone, so the author's refusal isn't entirely their fault.\n\nThe author's wife mentioned making jokes about the author's liberalism, which adds another layer. It seems like there's some underlying tension in the family about political views. The author's decision to let the son eat the food shows partial compromise, which might mitigate the situation a bit.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often avoid discussing politics or beliefs in family settings to prevent conflict. But the author was honest and explained their stance, which is fair. The in-laws felt it was odd, but the author isn't wrong for having those convictions. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to their beliefs and made a choice that aligns with their values. The in-laws might not agree, but that doesn't make the author an asshole. The answer should be B, No.\n"
