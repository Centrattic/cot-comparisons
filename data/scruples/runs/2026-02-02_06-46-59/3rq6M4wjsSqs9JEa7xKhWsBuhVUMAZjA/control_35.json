They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are moderate conservatives, and the mother-in-law was excited to treat everyone. The author explained their stance, which led to some awkwardness and jokes from the wife about the author's liberal views.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a personal conviction against supporting certain organizations, which is a valid reason for many people. The issue here is whether refusing to eat there was an overreaction or a justified stand based on their beliefs. \n\nChick-fil-A's support of anti-LGBTQ groups is a known issue for some, so the author's stance isn't without merit. However, the social dynamics here are important. The in-laws were trying to have a family meal, and the author's refusal might have caused discomfort. The mother-in-law was excited, and the author's explanation led to further discussion, which the in-laws might not have been prepared for. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did allow their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise. They also mentioned that they explained their reasons respectfully. The wife's reaction adds another layer, but the main question is about the author's actions. \n\nThe key factors are personal ethics vs. family harmony. The author isn't the one who forced the lunch at Chick-fil-A; the in-laws chose it. The author had the right to opt out based on their values. However, the situation might have been handled more smoothly to avoid making the in-laws feel judged. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't wrong for standing by their convictions. The in-laws brought a controversial choice to a family gathering, which could also be seen as insensitive. The author's refusal is a matter of personal ethics, and they aren't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
