They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are conservative, and the mother-in-law was excited to treat everyone there. The author explained their stance, had to explain what LGBTQ means, and eventually let their son eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has the right to hold personal beliefs about supporting certain businesses. They're not forcing anyone else, including their son, to not eat the food. However, they did cause some discomfort in the family setting by turning down the lunch that the MIL had been looking forward to. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The author's refusal is based on personal ethics, which is a valid reason.\n2. They allowed their child to eat the food, which might be seen as a compromise.\n3. The in-laws made jokes about the author's liberal views, indicating a possible clash in ideologies.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, family gatherings can be tricky. While it's important to stand by one's convictions, the way it's communicated matters. The author did explain their reasoning, which is respectful. The MIL was taken aback but asked for clarification, so the author didn't act out of spite. \n\nHowever, the situation might have been handled more smoothly. Perhaps the author could have found a middle ground, like agreeing to meet at a different restaurant occasionally or not making a big deal about it if the in-laws were genuinely trying to be inclusive. But the author's decision not to eat there is their personal choice, and they aren't forcing others. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are considered inconsiderate. While their stance is personal, it's not inherently wrong. The family's reaction shows they see it as a conflict, but that doesn't make the author the asshole for holding their beliefs. The compromise of letting the son eat the food also shows they aren't being entirely rigid. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for sticking to their principles, even if it caused some awkwardness. The in-laws' judgment and jokes are on their side. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not the asshole).\n"
