They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A due to the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The situation involves the author's in-laws, who are religious conservatives, and the mother-in-law was excited to treat everyone there. The author explains their stance, but the in-laws still find it odd and joke about the author's liberal views.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's decision is based on personal convictions regarding the company's donations. They didn't force anyone else to avoid the restaurant; they just refused to eat there themselves. They allowed their son to eat the food, showing some flexibility. The main conflict comes from the in-laws' reaction and the wife's comments. \n\nIs the author wrong for holding their beliefs? Well, people have the right to make personal choices based on their ethics. However, the question is whether this led them to act inconsiderately. The author tried to explain their reasons and even let their son eat the food, so they weren't entirely inflexible. The in-laws' discomfort might stem from differing values, but that doesn't necessarily make the author the \"asshole.\" \n\nOn the flip side, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe. Perhaps they could have chosen a different venue to avoid the conflict. But the scenario doesn't suggest they had that option. The crux is about personal ethics versus family dynamics. The author isn't preventing others from enjoying the meal, just themselves. So, the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
