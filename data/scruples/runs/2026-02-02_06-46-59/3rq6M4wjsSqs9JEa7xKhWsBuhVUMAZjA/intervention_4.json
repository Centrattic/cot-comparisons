They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of its donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, which led to some tension with their in-laws. The in-laws are described as semi-religious, moderate conservatives from a small town. The author's mother-in-law was excited to visit a local Chick-fil-A and wanted to treat everyone to lunch.\n\nFirst, the author explains their stance, which is about supporting LGBTQ rights. The in-laws were taken aback, but the author tried to explain. The mother-in-law pressed them to ignore their conventions and eat with the family. The author then let their son eat the food but refused for themselves. The wife made some jokes about the author's liberal ideologies.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's the case. Let's break down the factors. The author's decision is based on their personal values and the company's donations. The in-laws might not be aware of these issues, so the author is educating them. However, the in-laws were trying to be generous by treating everyone, and the author's refusal might have made them feel awkward or disrespected. \n\nBut the author also compromised by allowing their son to eat the food. That shows some flexibility. The question is whether the author's refusal was unreasonable. Since the author is an adult and has the right to make their own dietary choices, even for moral reasons, that part is defensible. The in-laws might have expected the author to set aside their views for family time, which is a common social expectation, but it's not necessarily wrong for the author to hold their ground. \n\nThe wife's reaction with minor jokes could indicate a lack of support from the spouse, which might add to the tension. However, the author's primary action is about their own beliefs. The key point is that the author didn't force anyone else to refuse; they just made their own choice. The son eating the food shows they didn't deny the in-laws' gesture entirely. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's considerate to accommodate family in some ways, it's also valid to hold personal convictions. The author's refusal isn't about the food itself but the company's actions. The in-laws might not agree with the author's views, but that doesn't make the author an asshole for standing by their principles. The compromise might have been appropriate to keep the peace. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting on their values and found a middle ground by allowing the child to eat the food. The in-laws' discomfort is unfortunate, but the author's choice is a personal one based on their beliefs.\n"
