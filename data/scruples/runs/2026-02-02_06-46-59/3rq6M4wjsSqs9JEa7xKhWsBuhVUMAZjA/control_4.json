They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's mother-in-law wanted to treat the family to Chick-fil-A, but the author refused to eat there because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law was taken aback, asked questions, and the author explained their stance. The author ended up letting their son eat the food but refused themselves. Now, the author is asking if they're the asshole for making the lunch awkward by not eating with the family and also for partially giving in by letting their son eat the food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the values and beliefs involved. The author is standing by their conviction about not supporting companies with certain political donations. That's a personal choice, and many people do make similar choices based on their ethics. On the other hand, the mother-in-law's excitement about the meal and the family's reaction (making jokes about the author's liberal ideologies) might create tension. The author felt it was important to explain their reasons, which is reasonable in a respectful conversation.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author overstepped. The mother-in-law wanted to treat everyone, which is a kind gesture. The author's refusal could be seen as dismissing that gesture, especially if it was important to the mother-in-law. However, the author isn't forcing anyone else to not eat the food; they allowed their son to partake. The author's refusal is about their own choices, which is their right. The awkwardness comes from the mother-in-law's reaction and the wife's comments, not necessarily the author's decision itself.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it usually involves being unreasonable or inconsiderate without justification. The author is standing by their beliefs and explaining them, which is respectful. The mother-in-law's jokes and the resulting tension might be more on the other side. The author isn't forcing their views on others; they're just choosing not to participate. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because personal convictions are valid unless they harm others. The author isn't harming anyone by not eating the food, even if it caused some awkwardness. Let me check again. The author's actions are about their own choices, not imposing on others. So B seems correct.\n"
