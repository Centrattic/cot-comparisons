They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The situation involves the author's in-laws, who are conservatives and semi-religious. The mother-in-law was excited to eat there and wanted to treat everyone. The author explained their reasons, leading to some tension, and eventually allowed their son to eat the food but not themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's refusal is based on personal convictions about supporting companies' political donations. The in-laws felt it was odd and made jokes about the author's liberal views. The author gave in a bit by letting their son eat the food but not themselves. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI should evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author has the right to their beliefs and can choose where they eat based on their values. Chick-fil-A's support for certain groups is a known issue for some people. On the other hand, the author's decision might have caused discomfort for their in-laws and wife, especially since the in-laws were looking forward to this meal. The author's refusal might have been seen as causing awkwardness during a family visit. However, explaining the reasons and allowing the son to eat it shows they weren't entirely rigid.\n\nIs it wrong to prioritize personal ethics over family's expectations? It's a balance between personal values and family harmony. The author did explain their reasoning, which shows respect. The in-laws might not agree, but the author isn't forcing anyone else to avoid the place. The compromise with the son suggests they tried to be accommodating. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They upheld their values without being confrontational, and allowing the son to eat the food shows they considered others' enjoyment. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
