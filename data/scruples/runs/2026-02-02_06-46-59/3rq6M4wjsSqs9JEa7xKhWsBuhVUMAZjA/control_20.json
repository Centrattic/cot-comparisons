They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they refused to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. Their mother-in-law was excited to use the nearby Chick-fil-A and wanted to treat the family to lunch. The author explained their reasons, but the in-laws were confused or unconvinced. The author ended up letting their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's stance is based on supporting LGBTQ rights, which is a valid personal belief. They have a right to their convictions, even if others don't agree. The mother-in-law, being from a small town and perhaps more conservative, might not be as aware of the controversies around Chick-fil-A. The author took the time to explain, which shows they tried to be respectful and informative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for refusing. On one hand, they're standing up for their values, which is important. On the other hand, the mother-in-law was looking forward to this, and the author caused some discomfort during family time. However, the author did compromise by allowing their son to eat the food, so it's not a complete refusal. The wife's reaction also indicates some tension, but the author tried to be respectful.\n\nI think the main issue here is balancing personal principles with family dynamics. The author isn't the asshole for having different views. They communicated their reasons and found a middle ground. The in-laws' jokes about the author's liberalism suggest they might not fully understand or respect the reasoning, but that's on them. The author's actions were respectful and considerate, even if they didn't fully comply with the family's initial plan.\n"
