They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's in-laws are semi-religious and moderate conservatives. The mother-in-law was excited to eat at Chick-fil-A because it's nearby. The author refuses to eat there because of the donations Chick-fil-A makes to anti-LGBTQ groups. The MIL wanted to treat everyone to lunch, but the author declines. They explain their reasoning, which leads to some tension. The in-laws left to get the food, the wife made jokes about the author's liberal views, and when they returned, the author let their son eat the food but refused themselves. Now they're asking if they're the asshole for causing awkwardness or for not fully giving in to their convictions.\n\nFirst, consider the author's stance. They have a personal conviction about supporting businesses based on their donations. That's a valid moral or ethical choice. People have the right to align their spending with their values. However, the situation is about a family gathering where the in-laws were looking forward to it. The author's refusal might be seen as causing discomfort, especially if they were the only one not participating. The fact that the author allowed their son to eat the food but not themselves complicates things. It might be seen as inconsistent or unfair to the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the in-laws might feel disrespected if their choice of restaurant is criticized. The author's explanation about LGBTQ issues and the donations could lead to a clash in values. The wife's reaction suggests there's some tension between their ideologies. The author's refusal to eat could be seen as standing up for their beliefs, but it's important to balance that with consideration for family dynamics.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. The author's decision is based on personal ethics, which is their right. However, in a family setting, especially with in-laws who have different views, maintaining harmony is important. The author might have handled it by compromising, like choosing a different restaurant that everyone could agree on, or respecting the in-laws' choice without participating. Letting the son eat but not themselves could be seen as a middle ground, but it might still cause awkwardness. \n\nThe key points here are personal conviction versus family harmony. The author isn't necessarily wrong for having their beliefs, but the way they handled it could be improved. However, the question is whether they are the asshole. Since the author stood by their convictions and explained their reasoning, they might not be in the wrong. But if the refusal caused significant discomfort without a clear compromise, maybe. However, since the author did allow their son to eat the food, they showed some flexibility. So, I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to their beliefs, even if it caused some awkwardness.\n"
