They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because the company supports anti-LGBTQ groups. The author's mother-in-law was excited to visit and wanted to treat everyone, but the author stood their ground. The wife made jokes about the author's liberalism, and even though the author let their son eat the food, they refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical perspectives here. The author's stance is based on personal convictions against supporting harmful organizations. On the other hand, the mother-in-law wanted a family meal without conflict. The key points are the author's right to hold their beliefs versus the potential awkwardness caused in the family setting.\n\nChick-fil-A's support of anti-LGBTQ groups is a real issue for many people. The author isn't just making a personal choice; they're aligning with a cause that affects others. The mother-in-law's reaction might stem from a lack of awareness or different values, but the author explaining their stance respectfully is valid.\n\nThe author did compromise by letting their son eat the food, showing they were trying to balance their convictions with family dynamics. The mother-in-law's jokes from the wife's side could add to the tension, but the author's refusal itself isn't malicious. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their beliefs, even if it caused some awkwardness. They handled it respectfully and made a concession where possible. The mother-in-law's expectations might need adjustment, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
