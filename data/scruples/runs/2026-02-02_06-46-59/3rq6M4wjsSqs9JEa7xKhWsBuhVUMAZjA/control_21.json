They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws are religious conservatives from a small town, and the mother-in-law was excited to treat everyone here. The author explained their stance, but the in-laws found it odd and made jokes about their liberal views. The author let their son eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions make them the asshole. First, I need to consider the moral aspect. The author has a personal conviction against supporting organizations that oppose LGBTQ rights. It's their right to hold that belief and act on it, especially since they're an adult and can make their own dietary choices. However, there's a social aspect here. The in-laws were excited, and the author's refusal might have caused awkwardness or hurt feelings. \n\nIs it unreasonable to expect someone to set aside their personal beliefs for family time? Maybe not, especially if the beliefs are important to them. The author did explain their reasoning, which shows they tried to be respectful. The in-laws might not agree, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. Also, the author allowed their son to eat the food, which could be seen as a compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a family setting, especially with in-laws, it's better to be more accommodating. But the author isn't forcing anyone else to eat there; they're just declining themselves. Their stance is based on ethical considerations, which many people support. The in-laws' jokes about the author's views might be part of the tension, but the author isn't the one making the jokes. \n\nSo, balancing these points, the author isn't in the wrong for upholding their beliefs. They communicated their reasons respectfully and made a compromise by letting their child eat the food. The in-laws' reactions stem from differing values, but that doesn't make the author the asshole. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
