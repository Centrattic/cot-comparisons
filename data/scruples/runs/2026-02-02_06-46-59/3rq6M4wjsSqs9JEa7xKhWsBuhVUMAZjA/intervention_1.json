They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A. The scenario involves the author's in-laws, who are moderate conservatives and semi-religious. The mother-in-law was excited to eat there during a visit. The author refuses because of Chick-fil-A's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. They had a conversation where the author explained their stance, but the in-laws still found it odd, and the wife made jokes about the author's \"liberal ideologies.\" The author then let their son eat the food but refused for themselves.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let me break this down. The key points here are personal convictions vs. family dynamics. The author is standing by their beliefs, which is understandable. They tried to explain their reasoning, which shows they weren't dismissive. However, the situation led to awkwardness and some jokes from the in-laws. \n\nThe question is whether refusing to eat there makes the author the asshole. On one hand, the author is not forcing their beliefs on others; they let their son eat the food, which might indicate they value family compromise. On the other hand, the in-laws were looking forward to it, and the author's refusal caused tension. \n\nBut is it wrong to have personal morals that affect social situations? If the author is comfortable with their decision and didn't impose it on others, maybe they're not in the wrong. The in-laws might not agree, but that's a difference in values. The author could have perhaps found a middle ground, like choosing a different restaurant that everyone could agree on, but they might have wanted to avoid conflict. \n\nThe wife's jokes suggest there's some underlying tension, but the author's actions were direct. The author's refusal to eat there is about their own choices, not forcing others. So, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, I need to consider if being inflexible in a family setting is unreasonable. But the author did compromise by letting the son eat the food, which shows they aren't entirely rigid. So, B makes sense.\n"
