They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author's in-laws are semi-religious and moderate conservatives. The mother-in-law was excited to eat at Chick-fil-A because there's one nearby during their visit. The author refuses to eat there because they donate to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch, but the author declined. The in-laws then went to get the food anyway, and the author ended up letting their son eat it but not themselves. The wife and in-laws made jokes about the author's liberalism. The author is asking if they're the asshole for causing awkwardness or if they did the right thing by sticking to their convictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's stance is based on supporting LGBTQ rights and not wanting to support organizations that donate to anti-LGBTQ groups. That's a valid personal belief. On the other hand, the in-laws were looking forward to this meal as a treat during their visit, and the author's refusal caused tension. The author's decision to let their son eat the food but not themselves might be seen as a compromise, but it also creates a mixed message.\n\nIs refusing to eat at a restaurant because of its donations a reasonable stance? Many people do choose where to spend their money based on a company's values. Chick-fil-A has been known for its conservative positions, so some people avoid them for that reason. The author's explanation about the donations might be enough for some people to understand, but the in-laws were taken aback and made jokes, which could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nThe author explained their reasoning, which is important. However, the situation could have been handled more smoothly. Maybe the author could have suggested an alternative restaurant that aligns with their values, or at least found a way to compromise without causing discomfort. By allowing the son to eat the food but not themselves, it might have been confusing for the child and could be seen as inconsistent.\n\nThe in-laws were visiting from a small town, which might have different cultural norms. The author's refusal might have been a cultural clash, especially if the in-laws don't share the same values. The author's stance is about personal ethics, but family gatherings can sometimes require flexibility to maintain harmony. However, the author also has the right to their beliefs.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the author acted inconsiderately without justification. The author did explain their reasoning, which shows they considered the in-laws' feelings. Still, the refusal might have been hurtful, especially if the in-laws were looking forward to it. The author's compromise of letting the son eat the food might have been a way to minimize conflict, but it doesn't resolve the awkwardness.\n\nI think the key points are the right to hold personal values versus the importance of family harmony. The author isn't in the wrong for having those values, but maybe could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether they're the asshole. Since they stood by their beliefs and tried to explain, they might not be the asshole. Alternatively, causing discomfort during a family visit might make them the asshole. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had a valid reason and tried to be respectful.\n"
