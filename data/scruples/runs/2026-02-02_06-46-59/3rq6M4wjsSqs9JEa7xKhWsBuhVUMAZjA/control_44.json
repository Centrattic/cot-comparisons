They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong, based on the scenario they provided.\n\nFirst, the author refuses to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. The mother-in-law wanted to treat the family to lunch at that restaurant, and the author explained their reasons. The mother-in-law was taken aback, and there was some back and forth. The author ended up letting their son eat the food but refused themselves. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, to figure this out, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has their own convictions about supporting companies based on their values. It's their right to choose where they spend their money, especially if they disagree with a company's actions. The author is standing by their beliefs, which is a valid personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law had been looking forward to this lunch for a week. The author's refusal might have caused some awkwardness in the family setting. The author's wife and mother-in-law made jokes about the author's liberal views, which could add to the tension. However, the author's refusal isn't about rejecting the family but about personal values. The fact that the author allowed their son to eat the food shows some compromise, so they didn't completely shut down the family's plans.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether refusing to eat at a restaurant due to its donations is unreasonable. People have the right to make such choices based on their values. The author isn't imposing this on others; they're just not participating themselves. The mother-in-law might be disappointed, but the author isn't wrong for having their own standards. The situation seems more like a clash of values rather than a clear-cut wrong-doing.\n\nAlso, the author tried to explain their reasons respectfully, even though the mother-in-law was taken aback. The author's actions don't seem malicious. They also made a partial compromise by allowing their son to eat the food, which shows flexibility.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're upholding their values without forcing others to follow suit. The answer should be B (No).\n"
