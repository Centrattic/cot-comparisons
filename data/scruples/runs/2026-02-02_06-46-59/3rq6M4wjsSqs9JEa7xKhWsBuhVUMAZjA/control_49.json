They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The author's in-laws are semi-religious, moderate conservatives. The mother-in-law was excited to eat at Chick-fil-A because it's nearby. The author refuses to eat there because of the donations Chick-fil-A makes to anti-LGBTQ groups. The in-laws thought it was odd and made jokes about the author's liberal views. The author let the child eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles here. The author is standing by their beliefs, which is about supporting LGBTQ rights. That's a personal conviction. On the other hand, the in-laws wanted to enjoy a family meal, and the author's refusal might have caused some awkwardness. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here.\n\nThe key points are: 1. The author's right to hold personal beliefs. 2. The impact on family dynamics. The author didn't force the in-laws to do anything; they just refused to participate. The mother-in-law wanted to treat everyone, but the author's refusal might have been a letdown. However, the author also allowed their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise.\n\nThe author isn't forcing anyone else to act against their will. They're making a personal choice. The in-laws made jokes about the author's views, which adds a layer of tension. The author's explanation about the donations and the meaning of LGBTQ might have been educational for the in-laws. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's values over family traditions? That's subjective. But the author isn't causing harm beyond a possibly awkward situation. They're not excluding others; they're just not participating themselves. The compromise of letting the son eat the food is a middle ground. \n\nIn many cases, standing by one's beliefs is seen as a positive trait, even if it causes some discomfort. The author isn't violating any laws or causing direct harm. The in-laws might not agree, but that doesn't make the author an asshole. The answer probably leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because it's about personal choice and conscience.\n"
