They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of their donations to anti-LGBTQ groups, leading to some tension with their in-laws. The in-laws were excited to visit a restaurant close to the author's home and wanted to treat everyone. The author explained their stance, which led to some awkwardness and even jokes from the wife about the author's liberalism. The author allowed their son to eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main issue is with the company's support of certain organizations. This is a personal moral stance. The in-laws, being more conservative, might not share that perspective, which led to conflict. The author is asking if they're the asshole for prioritizing their beliefs over family harmony.\n\nIn many cases, people have the right to make personal choices based on their values. However, in a family setting, especially with in-laws, it's important to consider how such decisions affect others. The author did explain their reasons and allowed their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise. But the in-laws might feel disrespected if their choice of restaurant is rejected, even if the author's reasons are valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to support organizations they disagree with. However, the way the situation was handled could have been smoother. Maybe there was an opportunity to suggest an alternative without making the in-laws feel dismissed. The wife's reaction adds another layer, perhaps indicating that the author's approach might have been perceived as confrontational.\n\nIt's a balance between personal ethics and family relations. The author isn't in the wrong for having their beliefs, but the manner and timing of asserting those beliefs might have caused unnecessary tension. So the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were seen as respectful and considerate towards the in-laws' feelings. If the author could have found a middle ground, like agreeing to a different meal option, it might have been better. But based on the information, the author tried to explain and did compromise by letting the son eat the food. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in handling such situations.\n"
