They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups.\n\nFirst, the author's in-laws wanted to treat everyone to lunch at a nearby Chick-fil-A. The author explained their reasons for not supporting the restaurant, which led to some tension. The mother-in-law was taken aback, asked for more details, and the author had to explain LGBTQ issues. The in-laws then went ahead without the author, making jokes about their liberal views. The author allowed their son to eat the food but refused themselves.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author is standing by their convictions against supporting an organization with opposing values. However, this caused awkwardness and discomfort during a family gathering. The key points here are the author's right to hold personal beliefs versus the impact on family relations. \n\nThe author's choice not to eat there isn't inherently wrong, especially if their values are important to them. However, the situation might suggest that there's a need for more compromise in family settings to maintain harmony. The author could have found an alternative solution, like suggesting a different restaurant or quietly eating separately without causing a scene. \n\nThe in-laws' reaction is also a factor. They might not be aware of the depth of the issue, and the author's explanation was perhaps necessary. But in a family setting, sometimes accommodating each other's preferences is important, even if it doesn't align with one's values. The author's refusal led to awkwardness, which could be seen as causing unnecessary tension. \n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely wrong for holding their beliefs, the way the situation was handled might have been more considerate. The answer hinges on balancing personal ethics with family dynamics. The author's partial compromise (letting the son eat the food) shows some flexibility, but the refusal to eat themselves was the main point of contention. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are understandable from a moral standpoint, but the impact on family relations might mean they're not entirely in the right. However, since they did make some effort to compromise, the answer leans towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
