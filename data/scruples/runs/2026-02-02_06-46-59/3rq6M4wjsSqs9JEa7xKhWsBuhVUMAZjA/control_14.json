They are visiting from a small town about an hour an a half from where I live. My MiL has been excited all week because she would be able to eat from Chick-fil-A that is 2 blocks from my house when she came to visit.\n\nThis would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.\n\nShe was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.\n\nAfter they left to get the food my wife told me they thought it was odd I wouldn\u2019t eat there and made minor jokes about my liberal ideologies while I was in the other room.\n\nWhen they came back,I did begrudgingly let my son eat the food the bought but I respectfully refused.\n\nSo am I the asshole for making the lunch that my MiL waited all week for somewhat awkward? Conversely I am an asshole for partially giving in to my convictions and letting my son eat the hate meal?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to eat at Chick-fil-A during a family lunch with their in-laws. The key points here involve personal beliefs versus family dynamics and whether the author overstepped.\n\nFirst, the author's in-laws are excited to eat at Chick-fil-A, which is close to their home. The author objects because of the company's donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. They explain their stance, which leads to some tension. The in-laws then proceed without them, and the author allows their son to eat the food but refuses themselves. The wife's reaction is also mentioned, with in-laws making jokes about the author's liberal views.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author has the right to hold personal convictions about supporting certain businesses. However, the question is whether refusing to eat there, despite the in-laws' excitement, was inappropriate. The author did explain their reasons, which shows they tried to be respectful. The in-laws wanted to include everyone, but the author's refusal might have caused discomfort. However, the author also allowed their son to eat the food, which shows some compromise. \n\nThe in-laws' reaction, making jokes about the author's beliefs, seems disrespectful. The author's stance is based on ethical reasons, which are valid. While family time should ideally be inclusive, the author isn't obligated to compromise their values for others' convenience. The main issue isn't about being an asshole but about differing values and how to handle them in a family setting. The author isn't the asshole here because they stood by their beliefs while still participating in the family activity to some extent.\n"
