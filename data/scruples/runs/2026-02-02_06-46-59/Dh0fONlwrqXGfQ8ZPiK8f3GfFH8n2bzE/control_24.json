Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and supports equal rights even if they disagree. They mentioned they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. The friend in question is genderfluid, and the author's partner (GF) is concerned they might be experimenting with being trans. The author was stoned when they voiced their disbelief and apologized later, affirming respect. They've avoided the group due to hostility, and others are comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity once while under the influence and apologized. They respect the friend regardless of their beliefs. The friend's partner is pushing for support, and the group seems to be using a \"coddling\" approach, maybe even over-sensitive. The author hasn't directly attacked the friend but holds a differing view.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author's stance is offensive. The author isn't attacking the friend directly but expressing skepticism. They apologized and show respect. However, the issue is if not \"buying\" a person's identity is harmful. Gender identity is considered a personal experience, and dismissing it can be seen as invalidating, even if done respectfully. But the author is not denying the friend's identity publicly; they're just not believing in the concept. Still, in modern contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is generally expected, regardless of personal belief. The author's apology and respect might mitigate some blame, but their expressed skepticism could still be hurtful, especially if the friend is struggling with their identity. The partner's reaction might have been part of the tension, but the author's actions (avoiding the group) might be a result of their discomfort rather than active malice. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The main conflict is between personal belief and respecting others' identities. Since the author is causing distress by expressing disbelief, even if they apologize, it could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. But they aren't refusing to respect the friend's identity, just doubting the concept. It's a tricky line. In many social contexts, respect for self-identified gender is paramount, so not \"buying\" it might be considered wrong. But the author isn't denying the friend's identity publicly or refusing to acknowledge it. They're just holding a personal belief. However, the fact that the friend's partner is upset and the group is hostile might mean the author's stance is causing harm, even if unintentionally. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for expressing disbelief, even if it's private and apologized for, because it's contributing to a negative environment for the friend.\n\nBut wait, the author says they don't oppose equal rights. So, maybe they're not in the wrong for their personal belief but are in the wrong for causing harm by voicing it in a context that's sensitive. The partner's message and the group's reaction might be part of the issue too. The author's decision to avoid the group is their choice, but the initial statement might still be problematic. So, considering all, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their disbelief, even if expressed privately, contributes to a hostile environment and invalidates the friend's experience, despite their apologies.\n"
