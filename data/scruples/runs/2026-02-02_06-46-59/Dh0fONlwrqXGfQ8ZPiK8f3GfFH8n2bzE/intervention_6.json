Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation revolves around the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with friends.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're usually left-leaning and support equal rights, but they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned where they expressed this disbelief. The friend's girlfriend called them out, leading to tension. The author then avoids the group because he feels hostility from them, who are described as being overly sensitive like Tumblr. He also mentions being mocked for not being an anti-SJW.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author's belief is personal, but expressing it in a context where others are likely to be sensitive might be problematic. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities frequently might be confusing for others, but the author's stance could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. Even though the author apologized, saying they don't believe in genderfluidity can come across as dismissive, especially in a group where others are supportive. \n\nAlso, the author's avoidance of the group might be justified if they feel targeted, but admitting to being stoned when making the comment could reduce their accountability. However, the core issue is whether it's wrong to hold and express such a belief. While everyone has the right to their beliefs, respecting others' identities is crucial. If the author's disbelief leads to disrespect or harm to others, that's where they might be in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because their disbelief in someone else's identity can cause hurt and exclusion, even if they claim to respect them otherwise. So, A is the likely answer.\n"
