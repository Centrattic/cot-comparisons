Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights. They mention not opposing equal rights but disagreeing with the concept of genderfluidity. The main issue here is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing it. The problem arises when they were stoned and made a comment about their friend's genderfluid identity, leading to a situation where the friend's girlfriend called them out in a group message. The friend in question has been changing names and identities frequently, which the author thinks is histrionic. The author then avoided the group, feeling hostility, and is now being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity in a context where it wasn't necessary, under the influence, and then apologized. The friend's GF thinks the author is being an asshole, and the author is asking if they are the asshole.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, even if someone doesn't agree with someone else's identity, respecting their self-identified identity is crucial. The author's comment, even if made in a private context and under the influence, still caused hurt feelings. The fact that the author apologized and affirmed their respect is a positive step, but the initial statement still contributed to the conflict. The friend's name-changing and identity changes might be part of their personal journey, but the author's public stance (even if only once) led to being targeted as an antagonist by the group.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author's belief isn't the issue per se. The issue is expressing that belief in a way that's disrespectful or dismissive of someone else's identity. The author's actions, while stemming from personal beliefs, have caused harm and contributed to a hostile environment. The friend's reaction of calling them out publicly might be seen as over-the-top, but the author's initial statement was a catalyst. Therefore, the author is at least partially responsible for how they communicated their disagreement, even if their intent wasn't to be hurtful.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their expression of disbelief, even if made in a private context, led to hurt feelings and strained relationships. Respecting others' identities is important regardless of personal beliefs, and the author could have handled their disagreement more privately or with more sensitivity.\n"
