Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and having some issues with their friend who identifies as genderfluid. \n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. That's their stance, but maybe the problem arises in how they expressed it. They were stoned when they mentioned not believing in it, which might have influenced their judgment. Then, the friend's girlfriend (GF) called them out in a group message, implying they were being an asshole, and there was some speculation that the friend was just trying out being trans. \n\nThe author mentions their friend changes names a lot and slips up on their identity, which they see as histrionic. But the key issue is whether the author's disbelief in genderfluidity is valid and if their actions were wrong. The author apologized after causing hurt feelings and respects their friends despite their personal beliefs. \n\nNow, considering the context, the author did express their disbelief, which might be offensive to the friend, especially in a group setting where the friend's identity is important. Even if they apologized, the initial statement could have been hurtful. The friend's GF's reaction and the subsequent hostility from the group might be a result of that. \n\nHowever, the author claims they only made the comment once, under the influence, and then apologized. They also affirm respect for their friends regardless of their beliefs. The problem here is whether the author's belief justifies their actions or if they should have kept quiet to avoid harm. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's identity is usually expected, even if one doesn't personally agree with it. The author's refusal to acknowledge the friend's genderfluid identity could be seen as invalidating, which is hurtful. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities might make it more sensitive for them, so the author's comment could be particularly damaging. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is an atheist and left-leaning, which usually aligns with progressive views. Their issue isn't with the friend's identity per se but with the concept. Still, expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity can be seen as transphobic, regardless of personal beliefs. \n\nThe author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility might be their own reaction to the situation, but the initial problem stems from their comment. The main question is whether the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity and expressing that, even if they apologized. \n\nIn many social contexts, the expectation is to respect others' self-identified gender regardless of personal beliefs. So, even if the author thinks they're in the right, their actions might be considered wrong because they didn't support their friend's identity, leading to hurt feelings and group tension.\n"
