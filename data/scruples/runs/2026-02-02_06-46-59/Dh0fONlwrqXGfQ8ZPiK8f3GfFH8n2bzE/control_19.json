Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The Reddit post describes the situation where the author, who self-identifies as very left and supportive of equal rights, has a friend who is genderfluid. The friend's partner is concerned, and the author had a discussion while stoned where he expressed skepticism about genderfluidity. He later apologized, but there's ongoing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states he doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to himself unless discussing. In one instance, under the influence, he mentioned it and then apologized. The friend's partner seems upset, and the friend is changing names and identities. The author avoids the group due to feeling hostility. He's compared to anti-SJW types, which is a label he rejects.\n\nNow, the main ethical question here is whether the author is wrong for expressing his disbelief, even if it's private and followed by an apology. In many modern ethical frameworks, especially in the context of social justice, validating someone's identity is considered respectful, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's disbelief might be seen as invalidating the friend's experience, which can be hurtful. Even if he apologized, the initial statement could have caused harm. The friend's partner's reaction suggests that the comment was hurtful, and the author's avoidance of the group might indicate he's aware of the sensitivity but still distances himself, which complicates his stance.\n\nHowever, the author claims he respects his friends regardless of his beliefs, and the situation involved being under the influence. There's also the nuance that the friend's identity seems unstable (changing names, inconsistent self-identification), which might affect how the situation is viewed. But in terms of personal ethics, the key is intent and respect. Even if the author has good intentions, expressing doubt in someone's identity can be seen as transphobic, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's skepticism and the resulting impact on the friend's feelings, most people would likely say the author is in the wrong because respecting someone's identity is expected, even if one personally disagrees. The apology is a mitigating factor, but the initial statement was hurtful. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
