Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author of the Reddit post is someone who identifies as left-leaning and atheist, and they don't oppose equal rights but personally don't believe in genderfluidity. They had a situation where a friend came out as genderfluid, and there was some tension.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they only once expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity while stoned and then apologized. They also clarified that they respect their friends despite their personal views. The friend's significant other accused them of being an asshole, implying they're not supportive. The author feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about respect, personal beliefs vs. others' identities, and the context of the statements. The author didn't force their views on others but had a private discussion under the influence. They apologized and affirm respect for their friends regardless. However, they also admit to avoiding the group due to feeling hostility, which might indicate a lack of willingness to engage despite the apology.\n\nBut in terms of whether they're in the wrong, it's important to consider that people's gender identities are personal and valid regardless of others' beliefs. Even if someone doesn't believe in a certain identity, they should respect others' self-identification. The author's statement about not buying into the concept might be seen as invalidating, even if they didn't act on it beyond one instance and apologized. The fact that their friend changed names frequently and the author thinks they're histrionic might contribute to the friend feeling disrespected. However, the author did take responsibility and express respect. \n\nThe line here is between personal belief and respecting others' identities. The author's stance could be seen as not fully respecting the friend's identity, but since they apologized and clarified their respect, maybe they're not in the wrong. But depending on the perspective, even expressing disbelief can be harmful. So it's a bit of a grey area. However, since the author did apologize and didn't push their views beyond one private conversation, maybe they're not in the wrong. But others might argue that just not believing in the concept is enough to be in the wrong. I'm leaning towards A (wrong) because of the invalidation of the friend's identity, but the answer might vary. Hmm.\n"
