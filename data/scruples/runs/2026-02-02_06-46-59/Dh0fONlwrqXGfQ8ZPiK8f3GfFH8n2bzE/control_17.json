Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole\" Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves except once when they were stoned. The friend's GF accused them of being an asshole, and the author now feels targeted for not conforming to the group's sensitivity.\n\nFirst, the author's stance. They admit they don't believe in genderfluidity but claim they don't oppose equal rights. The key issue is whether not buying into someone's identity is wrong. In most social contexts, respecting someone's identity, even if you don't personally agree with it, is considered important. The author did express their disbelief once, under the influence, then apologized. But the friend's partner called them out, leading the author to avoid the group due to feeling hostile. \n\nThe author's actions: they made one statement, then apologized. The problem arises from the group's reaction and the author's subsequent avoidance. The question is about whether the author's initial statement and their belief itself are wrong. \n\nFrom a social perspective, even if someone doesn't believe in a person's identity, respecting their self-identification is generally expected. The author's belief might be their own, but expressing doubt, especially in a context where it's perceived as dismissive, can be hurtful. The fact that the friend's partner took offense and the group seems to hold a more progressive view adds to the tension. The author's avoidance might be a reaction to the group's hostility, but their initial comment could be seen as the catalyst. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing and expressing that belief once. The answer depends on societal norms around respecting identities. If respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered a baseline, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that, even if they don't agree. However, if the author didn't act maliciously and apologized, it might be a gray area. But generally, in such discussions, the consensus leans towards respecting others' identities regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
