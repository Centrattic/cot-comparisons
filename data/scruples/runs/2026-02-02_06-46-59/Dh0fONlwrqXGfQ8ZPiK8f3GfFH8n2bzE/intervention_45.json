Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is from a Reddit post where someone is questioning their actions regarding a friend's genderfluid identity.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supports equal rights even when they disagree. They mention that they don't believe in genderfluidity but usually keep it to themselves unless discussing. There was an incident where they were stoned and expressed this disbelief, which their friend's girlfriend took issue with, leading to some tension. The author's friend has been changing names and identities, and the author feels the friend is being histrionic. The author now avoids the group, feels hostility, and is called out for being like anti-SJW people.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author made a comment under the influence about not believing in genderfluidity, which upset the friend's partner. They apologized, but the issue lingers. The question is about whether the author is an asshole here.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, gender identity is a personal and sensitive issue. Even if someone personally disagrees with a concept like genderfluidity, it's important to respect others' identities publicly. The author did express their disagreement in a private context but under the influence, which might be excusable, but still caused hurt. They apologized, which is a positive step, but the fact that they continue to avoid the group and engage in private judgment could be seen as problematic. The friends might feel disrespected or invalidated, especially if the author's comments are shared or if they feel their identities aren't supported. The author's actions, even if not malicious, might contribute to a hostile environment for their friends. So, considering the impact of their words and actions on others, even if they have a valid opinion, not supporting a friend's identity when it's important to them could be seen as being in the wrong. The answer is likely A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they didn't support their friend's identity and created tension.\n"
