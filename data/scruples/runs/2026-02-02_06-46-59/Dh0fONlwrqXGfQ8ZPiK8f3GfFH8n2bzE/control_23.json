Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity and facing backlash.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and supportive of equal rights, even when they disagree. They mention being an atheist and valuing knowledge. But here, they're stating they don't believe in genderfluidity. The friend in question is in a long-distance relationship with an MTF person, and the friend is now identifying as genderfluid. The author feels the friend is being histrionic, and there's been some conflict, including the friend's GF pointing out the author's name in a group message. The author was stoned when they made the comment, apologized, and tried to respect the friend's identity despite their belief. Now, they're avoiding the group because they feel hostility and are being mocked as an anti-SJW.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's personal belief conflicting with supporting the friend, the context of being stoned and apologizing, and the subsequent tension in the group. The author is trying to navigate respecting someone's identity while holding their own views. But in social contexts, especially with friends, respecting someone's self-identified gender is often considered important regardless of personal belief. Even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, they're in a position where they need to show respect. The fact that the friend changes names and identities might be confusing, but the author's choice to distance themselves could be seen as a valid personal decision if they can't reconcile their beliefs with the friend's actions. However, the way they expressed their disbelief, even under the influence, might have caused hurt feelings, which is why they apologized. The question is whether not believing in genderfluidity makes them the asshole here.\n\nIn many social circles, especially progressive ones, respecting someone's gender identity is a baseline, even if one personally disagrees. The author is trying to balance that by saying they respect the person regardless, but their not buying into the concept might still be causing issues. The friend's GF suggesting the friend is \"trying out being trans\" adds another layer. The author's discomfort leading them to avoid the group could be seen as a personal choice, but if they were part of the group, they might be expected to participate respectfully. The fact that they apologized and affirmed respect might mitigate being wrong, but the initial statement and the subsequent avoidance could still be viewed as problematic because they're not supporting a friend's identity. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even if they don't personally believe in genderfluidity, they should respect the friend's self-identification to maintain the relationship and avoid causing harm. However, there's also the aspect of personal beliefs versus social expectations. It's a nuanced situation, but in terms of being \"the asshole,\" the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they're not aligning their actions with the friend's self-identified needs for support and respect.\n"
