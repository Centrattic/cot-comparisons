Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and facing some backlash from their friends.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions they are left-leaning, atheist, and support equal rights even when they disagree. They don't personally believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. The issue came up when they were stoned and made a comment, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out. The friend in question is genderfluid and has been changing names and identities. The author now avoids the group due to hostility and feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's personal disbelief in genderfluidity but attempting to respect others' rights, a comment made under the influence, and the reaction from friends. The author apologized and affirmed respect. The friends, on the other hand, seem to be part of a more sensitive group, maybe influenced by Tumblr's oversensitivity.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and current discussions on gender identity. Genderfluidity is recognized by many as a valid gender identity. The author's personal disbelief might not necessarily make them wrong if they respect others' self-identification. However, expressing disbelief in a context where it can be hurtful, even if done once and under the influence, could be problematic. The fact that they apologized and stated they respect their friends regardless is mitigating.\n\nBut the author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility might indicate that the friends' reactions were overly sensitive. The question is whether the author's initial statement was in the wrong. Since the author didn't force their views but expressed their disbelief in a private discussion, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, in a group where the person is genderfluid, expressing disbelief\u2014even if done once\u2014can be hurtful and contribute to a hostile environment. The author's belief in equal rights despite personal views is positive, but the act of not accepting someone's identity could be seen as invalidating.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether personal disbelief translates to being the asshole when kept private and apologized for. The friends' overreaction and grouping the author with anti-SJW types might be the main issue. But if the friend is genuinely genderfluid, the author's disbelief might be seen as dismissive. However, the author isn't attacking the person's identity but the concept itself. Still, in practice, denying someone's self-identified gender can be hurtful. The author's stance is on the concept, not on the individual's identity, but the line between personal belief and respecting others' experiences is thin here.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they expressed their disbelief privately, apologized, and affirm respect. The friends' reaction might be the main problem here. So the answer would be B (No). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The author did make a comment that was hurtful, even if under the influence. But if they apologized and clarified their stance, maybe it's acceptable. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have points, but the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
