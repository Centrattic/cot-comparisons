Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves the author not believing in the concept of genderfluidity, which is causing some tension with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author identifies as someone who's generally progressive but doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity. They mentioned this in a stoned conversation, and later there were issues with their friend's gender identity. The friend's partner sent a message asking others to be supportive, specifically calling out the author. The author also notes that the friend has changed names multiple times and hasn't altered their appearance or habits. The author now avoids the group due to hostility and feels targeted in jokes about being anti-SJW.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the author's disbelief in genderfluidity. Even if they don't personally believe in it, respecting others' identities is crucial. The author did express their belief in the context of a discussion, which might be okay if done respectfully. However, the fact that their friend's partner specifically called them out and the subsequent avoidance suggests that the author's comments may have been hurtful or not respectful in practice.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they apologized and affirm respect, but the ongoing issues with the group indicate that their initial statement might have caused lasting harm. The key is whether the author is respecting the friend's identity regardless of their personal beliefs. Believing or not believing in a concept is different from respecting someone's self-identification. The author's discomfort and the resulting avoidance could be seen as a failure to support their friend, which is problematic despite their own views.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is stating their personal belief and hasn't forced it upon others. However, in social contexts, especially when friends are involved, personal beliefs can impact relationships. The problem arises when those beliefs lead to exclusion or disrespect. The author's actions (avoiding the group, being called out) suggest that their stance has caused division, which might make them the issue here.\n\nSo, considering the balance between personal belief and respecting others' identities, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, even if they don't agree with the concept. Respecting someone's self-identified gender isn't about agreeing with the concept but acknowledging their right to identify that way. Therefore, the answer would be A (in the wrong).\n"
