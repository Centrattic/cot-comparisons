Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and having some conflicts with friends.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are left-leaning, atheist, and support equal rights even if they disagree with certain beliefs. They don't oppose equal rights but don't believe in genderfluidity. The key here is that they keep their views to themselves unless discussing. However, one time when they were stoned, they expressed not believing in it, and then a friend's girlfriend called them out in a group message, implying they might be trans. \n\nThe friend in question has changed names multiple times and sometimes refers to their birth name or male pronouns. The author thinks the friend is histrionic and avoids the group because they feel hostility. The author apologized after the incident but feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity. But regardless of their personal belief, respecting others' identities is crucial. Even if someone doesn't agree with a person's identity, they should respect it. The fact that the author expressed their disbelief in a group context, even if under the influence, might have hurt the friend's feelings. The friend's GF was upset enough to call them out directly, which suggests that the author's comment was offensive or hurtful to them.\n\nThe author apologized, which is good, but the fact that they continued to avoid the group because they felt hostility could be their own reaction to the situation. However, the core issue is whether the author was wrong for not believing in genderfluidity and expressing that belief in a way that caused conflict. \n\nIn many social contexts, even if someone doesn't personally agree with a person's identity, it's considered respectful to acknowledge and respect it. The author's stance might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, which can be hurtful. The fact that the friend is changing names and identities might indicate they're exploring their identity, and the author's skepticism could make them feel unsupported. \n\nThe author's personal beliefs, even if they support equal rights otherwise, don't absolve them of respecting others' identities. The problem here is not just about the belief but the impact of expressing that belief in a way that caused friends to feel targeted. The jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types might be a result of others perceiving the author as transphobic or disrespectful, which could be justified if the author made derogatory or dismissive remarks.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may have good intentions and support equal rights, their action of expressing disbelief in a context that hurt their friend and caused a rift in the group is where they might be in the wrong. Respecting others' identities is a social norm, and even if one disagrees, it's about how you handle those disagreements. The author's behavior led to conflict and alienation, which makes them the asshole in this scenario.\n"
