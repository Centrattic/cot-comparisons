Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluid identity. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe user says they're as left-leaning as possible and support equal rights even if they disagree. They don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves except during discussions. In one instance, while stoned, they expressed their disbelief. The friend's GF (girlfriend?) sent a group message asking everyone to be supportive, mentioning the author specifically. The friend in question is changing their name multiple times, sometimes using their birth name or identifying as male. The author thinks they're being histrionic and avoids the group because of their hostility towards the \"Tumblr sensitivity.\" They apologized after the incident and respect their friends regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nNow, the user is asking if they're an a-hole (AITA). The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around gender identity. Genderfluidity is a recognized gender identity where a person's gender identity changes over time. Dismissing someone's identity can be hurtful. The author admits they don't believe in it but says they usually keep it to themselves. However, in this case, they made a comment while under the influence, which led to conflict.\n\nEven though the author apologized and respects their friends' rights, the act of not acknowledging someone's gender identity can be seen as invalidating. The friend's partner expressed concern, indicating that the comment was hurtful. The author's avoidance of the group might be due to discomfort with the group's dynamics, but that's not the main issue here.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. In many social and psychological contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered important, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's stance might be based on personal disbelief, but it's not respectful to a person's identity. Even if the author supports equal rights, not acknowledging someone's gender identity can still be harmful. The fact that the comment was made in a discussion and under the influence might mitigate some responsibility, but the impact on the friend is significant.\n\nTherefore, the author's disbelief and subsequent comment, even with an apology, could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because they didn't respect their friend's self-identified gender, leading to hurt feelings and social tension.\n"
