Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. The scenario is from an AITA post where the author admits they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves except during discussions, like when they were stoned. The friend's partner publicly called them out in a group message, suggesting the author was being an asshole for not supporting their friend, who's transitioning or identifying as genderfluid. The author apologized and respects their friends but has since avoided the group due to hostility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's beliefs are personal, but they're expressed in a context that caused distress. Even if the author says they respect their friend despite not believing, the key issue is whether their expression of disbelief was inappropriate. The friend changed names multiple times and the author thinks they're being histrionic. The partner's reaction and the group's hostility led the author to avoid them.\n\nIn terms of social norms, especially in modern contexts, respecting someone's identity is crucial even if one disagrees. However, the author did apologize and clarify their stance. The problem might be that the author's initial statement, even under the influence, contributed to the friend's discomfort. The partner's response and the group's behavior might be over the top, but the author's refusal to acknowledge the identity could be seen as dismissive, regardless of personal belief.\n\nAlso, the author's avoidance of the group could be seen as a withdrawal due to not wanting to engage with what they perceive as hypersensitivity, which might not be the healthiest approach. But whether they're in the wrong depends on the balance between personal belief and respecting others' identities. The partner's public shaming might be the real issue here, but the author's initial stance could still be problematic.\n\nIn many cases, even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, respecting someone's self-identified gender is expected. The author's stance might be considered insensitive, even if they respect the person otherwise. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because their disbelief was expressed in a way that caused harm, despite their personal respect. They should support their friend's identity regardless of personal belief.\n"
