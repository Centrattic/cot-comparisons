Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is the asshole (AITA). The situation involves their friend being genderfluid and the author not believing in that concept. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights even if they disagree. They mention not believing in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves except during discussions. The friend in question is in a relationship with an MTF (male-to-female) person and the friend has recently identified as genderfluid. The author was stoned when they expressed their disbelief, and the friend's GF (girlfriend?) took offense, implying the author is being an asshole. The author then avoids the group because of hostility and mentions they were under the influence when they made the comment.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's disbelief in genderfluidity and how that interacts with their friend's identity. The author says they apologized and respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. However, the friend's partner is upset, leading to group tension. \n\nI need to consider societal standards around gender identity. Genderfluid is a recognized identity for some people, and respecting others' identities is generally seen as important in modern times. Even if someone doesn't personally believe in a concept, it's about respecting others' self-identification. The author's private belief vs. public behavior matters here. They say they keep their doubts to themselves unless discussing, but the incident where they were stoned led to a public apology. \n\nThe fact that the friend is changing names and identities frequently might make the author question the validity, but that doesn't mean the author is right to express disbelief. The author's avoidance due to hostility from the group could be a result of their own words causing offense. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in expressing their disbelief, especially under the influence, leading to hurt feelings. Even though they apologized, the fact that they don't believe in genderfluidity at all could be problematic. It's about respecting others' identities regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, even if they disagree privately.\n"
