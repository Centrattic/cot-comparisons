Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their Reddit post. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and having conflicts with a friend who identifies that way. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is described as left-leaning and an atheist, supports equal rights even when they disagree. They were introduced to a group of friends where one person is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. Then, during a stoned conversation, the author made this stance known. The friend's partner called them out in a group message, leading to tension. The author mentions avoiding the group because of their hostility and criticism towards \"anti-SJW\" types. They apologized but still feel targeted.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's problem is not with the friend's identity per se but with the concept of genderfluidity. They expressed their disbelief once while under the influence and then apologized. However, the friend's partner publicly called them out, which might have escalated things. The author claims they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs but are now being mocked for not being as \"SJW.\"\n\nI think the key factors are: 1) The author's statement was made in a private discussion, not in a public or malicious context. 2) They apologized and affirmed respect. 3) The friend's partner took it personally and publicly criticized them. 4) The author is being compared to anti-SJW groups, which might be unfair because their stance is a personal belief, not hate speech. \n\nHowever, even if the author's intention was respectful, stating disbelief in someone's gender identity can be hurtful. The friend changing names and identities frequently might contribute to the author feeling confused, but that doesn't justify the author's stance. The author's problem isn't with their friend but with the concept, which is their personal belief, but expressing that in a context where it's sensitive could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author was under the influence when making the comment. While that might affect judgment, it's still their responsibility to consider the impact. The partner's reaction is part of the dynamic, but the author's avoidance is a result of the group's hostility. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they expressed a personal belief and apologized. However, the way they handled it (especially under the influence) might have been careless. But the main question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they made an effort to apologize and respect the friend, maybe they aren't the asshole. But if someone's identity is invalided, that's hurtful. The author's stance is on a concept, not the person. So maybe they're not in the wrong, but their comment was hurtful. The partner's reaction is also part of the conflict. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, even if they apologized, the initial statement of not believing in genderfluidity could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, which is hurtful. So maybe the author is in the wrong for expressing disbelief in a way that caused hurt, despite their apologies and intentions. \n\nBut the author says they don't oppose equal rights. However, denying someone's identity could be seen as opposing their rights. The difference here is between supporting rights and accepting personal beliefs. The author's issue is with the concept, not the person. But if the friend identifies as genderfluid, denying that concept can feel like denying their identity. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance might stem from personal beliefs, but expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity can be harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not affirming their friend's identity, even if they support their rights otherwise. So, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
