Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and this causing some conflict with their friends.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're left-leaning and support equal rights regardless of personal disagreements. They don't oppose equal rights but personally don't believe in genderfluidity. They had a conversation while stoned where they expressed this disbelief, leading to their friend's girlfriend feeling targeted and making claims about the author's intentions.\n\nThe key points here are the author's expression of disbelief in genderfluidity, even if they apologized and clarified their respect. The friend's reaction was to publicly call out the author, which escalated tensions. The author also mentions avoiding the group due to feeling hostility and being mocked for being against social justice warrior (SJW) ideologies.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the author admitted to saying they don't believe in genderfluidity, which was under the influence and apologized for. However, the friend's GF took it as a personal attack and spread it in a group message. The author is now facing jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types, which makes them feel targeted.\n\nFrom a social perspective, even if the author's views are their own, expressing disbelief in someone else's gender identity can be seen as invalidating. But the author did clarify they respect their friends regardless. The friend's reaction seems over the top, using the group message to single out the author. The author's position is that they hold personal beliefs but support equal rights, which is a common stance in debates about gender identity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is not just the initial statement but the consequences and the friend's response. However, the author did apologize and made it clear they respect others' identities. The friend's GF's actions (group message, implying the author is trying to be an asshole) might be more at fault. The author's avoidance is due to feeling hostility, which the friend's GF likely contributed to.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, the author's personal disbelief in genderfluidity, even if not acted upon, can be seen as problematic because it dismisses someone else's identity. However, the author isn't refusing to respect their friend's identity, just their personal belief. The line here is between personal belief and respecting others' identities. The author isn't attacking their friend or denying them rights; they're just expressing a personal disbelief without forcing it on others.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they apologized, expressed respect, and aren't engaging in discrimination. The friend's reaction seems more about sensitivity and possibly overreacting. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
