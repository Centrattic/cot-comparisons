Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and facing backlash from friends.\n\nFirst, the key points from the post: The author identifies as very left-leaning and supportive of equal rights, even when they disagree. They were introduced to friends, one of whom is in a long-distance relationship with a genderfluid person. The author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but usually keeps their opinion to themselves. However, when stoned, they mentioned their disbelief, which led to being called out by the friend's GF. The friend in question has changed their name multiple times and sometimes slips up on their identity. The author now avoids the group, feeling hostility from their overly sensitive approach. They apologized for causing hurt feelings and respect their friends regardless, but are being mocked for not being an \"SJW.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the author's disbelief in genderfluidity and expressing it, even if it was under the influence. While they apologized, the fact remains that they publicly expressed a view that's harmful and dismissive of someone's identity. Even if they didn't act on it beyond one mention, saying they don't believe in genderfluidity can be hurtful. The friends' reaction, while perhaps over-sensitive, is a response to the author's invalidation of their friend's identity. The author's avoidance of the group might be due to discomfort with the political correctness they perceive, but that doesn't excuse the initial statement. The author's stance, even if personal, contributed to the tension. So, from a social justice perspective, the author's disbelief and the subsequent comment were inconsiderate, even if they later apologized. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong (A).\n"
