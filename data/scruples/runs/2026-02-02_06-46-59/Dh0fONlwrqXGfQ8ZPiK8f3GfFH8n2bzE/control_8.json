Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying their friend's genderfluidity. The situation involves a friend who identifies as genderfluid, and the author, who is on the left and supports equal rights, doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves except in discussions. A specific incident happened where the author was stoned and expressed doubt, leading to being called out by the friend's GF. The author now feels hostility from the group and is being mocked for not being an anti-SJW.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they support equal rights regardless of personal beliefs. They only mentioned their disbelief once, when stoned, and apologized. They also respect their friends despite their differences. The friend's GF accused the author of being an asshole, and the group is acting hostile. The author is being compared to anti-SJW types, which they find unfair.\n\nNow, legal and ethical standards: in many places, respecting someone's gender identity is considered a basic courtesy, regardless of one's personal beliefs. The author's public expression of disbelief, even if in a private group, could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. However, the author claims they apologized and respect their friend's rights.\n\nThe author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity, which is a personal opinion. But expressing that disbelief, even in a private setting, might be hurtful. The fact that the friend has changed names multiple times and has inconsistent identity cues could lead the author to question, but it's not the author's place to validate or invalidate someone's identity. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed a line into being disrespectful or harmful.\n\nThe author says they avoid the group due to hostility, which might be a reaction to the friend's GF's public shaming. The author's apology suggests they recognized the harm. The question is if expressing personal disbelief in a private context, followed by an apology, makes them the asshole. On Reddit's AITA, the community often emphasizes respecting others' identities and the impact of one's words, even if they don't personally agree.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have malicious intent, their disbelief and the way it was expressed (even if under the influence) led to hurt feelings and tension. The friend's GF's public call-out and the group's hostility might be overreacting, but the author's initial statement was still a point of contention. The author's apology and continued respect for their friends might mitigate some of the blame, but the core issue is the invalidation of someone's identity, which is generally frowned upon. So, the answer would be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because their disbelief was expressed in a way that hurt their friend, despite their apology.\n"
