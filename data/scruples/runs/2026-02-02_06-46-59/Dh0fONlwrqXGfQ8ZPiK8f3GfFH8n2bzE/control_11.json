Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the Reddit post they provided. The main issue here is the author's stance on genderfluidity and their reaction to a friend's announcement.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as very left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights even if they disagree. That's a good start, but they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. The problem arises when they made a comment not believing in it, especially while stoned, leading to their friend's girlfriend calling them out in a group message. The friend in question is genderfluid and has been changing names and pronouns, which the author finds histrionic.\n\nThe author avoided the group due to perceived hostility and feels they're being mocked for not being an \"SJW.\" They apologized after making their comment but still face backlash. \n\nNow, considering the ethics: The author's belief doesn't make them right if their actions caused harm. Even if they meant no harm, publicly disagreeing with someone's identity, especially when it's part of their personal journey, can be hurtful. The key points are whether the author respected their friend's identity despite their disbelief and if their actions were supportive or not.\n\nThe author did apologize, but maybe didn't fully commit to respecting the friend's identity beyond their personal belief. The friend's GF felt the need to mention the author specifically, indicating that the comment was taken as offensive. The author's avoidance of the group due to the \"hostility\" might be a way to avoid addressing their own behavior.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, respecting others' identities is crucial, even if one doesn't personally agree. The author's stance might be seen as invalidating their friend's experience, which is a form of harm. While they claim to respect the friend regardless, the actions (like making the comment and avoiding the group) contradict that. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions didn't fully support their friend's identity, leading to conflict.\n"
