Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supports equal rights even when they disagree. They have a friend who is genderfluid, but the author doesn't believe in the concept. There was a situation where the friend's girlfriend (GF) sent a group message about being supportive, specifically mentioning the author. The GF also speculated that the friend is trying out being trans. The friend changes their name multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name or identifies as male. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility, which they attribute to the group's sensitivity and Tumblr culture. The author mentioned once not believing in genderfluidity while stoned, apologized, and respects their friends regardless. They're now being mocked as an anti-SJW.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the author's belief versus the friend's identity, the context of the comment (stoned, apologized), and the reaction from the group. \n\nThe author's stance is personal disbelief in genderfluidity but claims respect for the person. However, expressing disbelief, especially when under the influence, can be hurtful. The fact that the friend's partner mentions the author specifically suggests that the comment caused distress. The author's avoidance of the group might also contribute to tension. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not buying into the genderfluidity. While the author claims respect, their disbelief is a personal opinion, but the way it was expressed (publicly in a group, under the influence) might have been inappropriate. The friend changing names and identities could indicate genuine personal exploration, so the author's judgment might be invalidating their experience. \n\nThe author's apology might mitigate some responsibility, but the ongoing avoidance and the group's reaction suggest lasting harm. The key here is that respecting someone's identity isn't about agreeing with it but accepting their self-identification. Even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, they should refrain from expressing that in ways that hurt the person involved. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions\u2014especially the public mention and the subsequent avoidance\u2014might be seen as invalidating their friend's identity, which could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
