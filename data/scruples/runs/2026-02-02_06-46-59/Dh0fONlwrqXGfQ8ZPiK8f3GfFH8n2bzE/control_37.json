Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is part of a group of friends where a friend identifies as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves except during discussions. There was an incident where the author said they don't believe in genderfluidity while stoned and got called out by the friend's GF. The author apologized and respects their friends, but now feels targeted in jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't buy into genderfluidity but don't oppose equal rights. That seems to indicate they're trying to be respectful even if they disagree. The key points here are that the author's disbelief is a personal opinion, and they've apologized for their comment. The friend's partner is upset, but the author hasn't done anything more than express a personal view, albeit under the influence.\n\nHowever, in the context of modern social dynamics, questioning someone's gender identity can be seen as offensive, especially if it's a private matter. The author's comment might have been hurtful even if made in a discussion. But they did apologize and affirm their respect. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing their disbelief, even if they are being respectful otherwise.\n\nThe friend's partner seems to have overreacted by singling out the author and making assumptions about the friend's identity. The author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility might be a reaction to that overreaction. The group's \"oversensitivity\" and \"Tumblr ethos\" could be contributing to the conflict.\n\nBut the core question is about the author's actions. They made a comment they regretted, apologized, and continue to respect their friend. The friend's partner is making it personal, and the group is excluding the author. The author is not actively harming anyone beyond their initial comment. Their stance is controversial, but they are trying to navigate it respectfully.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, they should respect others' identities. But the author is not denying rights or treating the friend poorly. The problem arises if the disbelief leads to disrespect or harm. However, the author's actions here seem to be passive disagreement without active harm. The main conflict is between the author's personal beliefs and the friend's need for support.\n\nConsidering this, the answer would depend on whether expressing disbelief is considered wrong. In many contexts, it's seen as harmful to question someone's identity, but the author isn't doing that directly. They're stating their own disbelief but respecting the person. The friend's partner's reaction might be part of the issue. So, the author might not be in the wrong if they're respectful and not actively undermining the friend's identity.\n"
