Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in their friend's genderfluid identity. The author is left-leaning, atheist, and supports equal rights but has a personal disagreement with genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author once expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity while stoned, which led to some backlash from the friend's partner. They apologized and said they respect their friends despite their beliefs. The author now avoids the group because of the hostility and the friends being overly sensitive, comparing them to Tumblr's ethos.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social justice perspective, respecting someone's identity, even if you don't agree with it, is usually emphasized. The author did express their disbelief, even if it was under the influence, which might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. However, they did apologize and clarify their respect. \n\nBut the friend's partner called out the author specifically, which might indicate that the comment was hurtful. The author's ongoing avoidance could be seen as a response to the group's hostility, but maybe they should have tried to maintain the relationship despite their personal beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a supportive community but has personal doubts. The line between personal belief and respecting others' identities can be tricky. If the author didn't directly attack the friend but just expressed skepticism, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the fact that the friend is changing names and identities frequently might complicate things. \n\nI think the key here is that even if the author's belief is their own, expressing disbelief in someone's identity can be hurtful, especially if it's part of their self-expression. The author's apology might mitigate some blame, but the ongoing avoidance and the group's reaction suggest that the author's comment had a negative impact. So, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, even if they don't personally agree. \n\nBut wait, the author says they don't oppose equal rights and keep their views private unless discussing. The specific incident was under the influence and a one-time thing. The friends might be overreacting, especially if the author respects them regardless. The partner's reaction could be part of a more sensitive group dynamic. \n\nIn some perspectives, personal beliefs vs. respecting others' identities are separate. But in social contexts, especially close friendships, respecting someone's identity is crucial. The author's statement, even if a one-time thing, might have crossed a line by not affirming their friend's identity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they expressed disbelief in their friend's identity, which can be seen as invalidating, even if they later apologized. The friend's partner's reaction and the group's hostility suggest that the author's comment was significant. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
