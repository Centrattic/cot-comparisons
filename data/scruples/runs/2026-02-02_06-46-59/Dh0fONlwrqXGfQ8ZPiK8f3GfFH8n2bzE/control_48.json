Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the Reddit post provided. Let me break down the details here.\n\nThe author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights even if they disagree with certain ideologies. They mention a friend who is genderfluid, but the author doesn't believe in the concept. However, they usually keep their thoughts private unless discussing. In one instance, while stoned, the author expressed their disbelief, which led to the friend's girlfriend (GF) sending a message to the group, specifically mentioning the author, and later the GF speculated that the friend might be \"trying out being trans.\" The friend has been inconsistent with their name and identity, using their birth name and male pronouns sometimes. The author feels their friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to perceived hostility. They mentioned that the group is overly sensitive, similar to Tumblr's ethos. The author apologized after the incident and affirmed respect for their friends despite personal beliefs. They also mention being targeted in jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the key questions here. The author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity and the subsequent comment under the influence. The friend's GF took offense, leading to group tension. The author apologized but still chose to distance themselves, which might be problematic. \n\nFrom a social perspective, even if someone doesn't personally agree with a person's identity, respecting their self-identified gender is crucial. The fact that the author made a public statement under the influence that caused hurt feelings suggests a lack of consideration for the friend's identity. The friend changing names and pronouns frequently might indicate that navigating their identity is already challenging, so the author's comment could have added to that stress. \n\nThe author claims to support equal rights but the action here contradicts that by not affirming the friend's identity. Even if the author is skeptical, expressing that skepticism in a private context might be different from public dismissal. The apology helps, but the ongoing avoidance of the group points to lingering issues. \n\nAlso, the comparison to anti-SJW types could imply that the author is being unfairly targeted, but if the group perceives their comment as harmful, then the reaction is somewhat justified from the group's side. The author might need to take responsibility for their words and actions, even if they personally don't believe in the concept. Respecting others' identities is a social norm, especially in supportive communities.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's disbelief isn't the issue per se, but how they expressed it and the subsequent avoidance might be seen as dismissive. The correct approach would be to respect the friend's identity regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
