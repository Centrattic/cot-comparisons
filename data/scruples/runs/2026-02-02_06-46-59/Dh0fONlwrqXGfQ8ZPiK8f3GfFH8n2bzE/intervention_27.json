Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and facing backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is part of a group where a friend identifies as genderfluid. The friend's girlfriend is upset and even mentions the author specifically in a message asking for support. The author acknowledges that they don't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. However, in one instance while stoned, the author made a comment, then apologized. The friend has changed names multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name or identifies as male. The author feels the friend is histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility. They mention the group being overly sensitive like Tumblr. The author says they only once expressed disbelief and apologized if it hurt feelings, emphasizing respect despite personal beliefs. They are now being mocked as an anti-SJW.\n\nSo, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From a social perspective, respecting someone's identity is important. Even if the author has doubts, expressing non-belief can be hurtful. The fact that the comment was made in a group message and the friend's GF specifically called out the author suggests it was a public issue. The author did apologize, which shows they tried to make amends, but the impact of their words might still have been damaging. The friend's changes in name and identity might make the situation more sensitive. The author's avoidance could be seen as a reaction to the tension but might also be perceived as withdrawal of support. \n\nOn one hand, the author is expressing their belief, which they have the right to do. On the other hand, in a close-knit group, such a comment can affect relationships. The key is whether the author's actions were considerate. They did apologize, so maybe they took responsibility. But the ongoing tension and jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types indicate that the situation is ongoing. The author might be in the wrong for not fully respecting the friend's identity, even if they keep their disbelief private. Publicly expressing disbelief, even under the influence, can be seen as harmful. But the author did apologize, which is a step towards resolution.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's initial comment was likely hurtful, so they might be in the wrong. However, their willingness to apologize and respect the friend despite their beliefs could mitigate some of the blame. But the core issue is the lack of acceptance of the friend's identity, which is a valid concern in modern social contexts where respecting personal identity is paramount. So, A (they are in the wrong) seems more likely.\n"
