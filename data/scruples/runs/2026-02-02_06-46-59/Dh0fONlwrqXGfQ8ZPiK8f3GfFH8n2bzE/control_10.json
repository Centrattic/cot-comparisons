Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is about the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author identifies as left-leaning and atheist, supports equal rights but personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned, and the friend's girlfriend accused them of being an asshole. The friend changes names and identities frequently, and the author feels the friend is being histrionic. The author apologized and respects their friends regardless of their beliefs but now is being mocked for not being an anti-SJW.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not accepting someone else's gender identity. In many modern contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is seen as a basic courtesy, even if one doesn't personally agree with the concept. The author's statement that they don't believe in genderfluidity could be hurtful, even if they apologize later. \n\nThe key points to consider: The author made a judgment about their friend's identity, which is a personal and sensitive aspect. Even if the author is apologetic, the act of expressing disbelief in someone's identity can be damaging. The friend's girlfriend called them out, and the group seems to be upset. The author's avoidance of the group due to hostility might be a consequence of their own actions. \n\nHowever, the author did apologize and respects their friends regardless. They also mentioned they don't oppose equal rights. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong. In social contexts, not respecting someone's identity, even if it's a personal belief, is often considered disrespectful or hurtful. The author's public statement (even if under influence) led to conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they expressed disbelief in a friend's self-identified gender, which is generally seen as invalidating and disrespectful, regardless of their other progressive views.\n"
