Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they're left-leaning and support equal rights, even when they disagree. They only express their disbelief in genderfluidity once, while stoned, and then apologize. The problem arises because the friend's significant other took offense, leading to tension. The author avoids the group due to hostility and feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJWs.\n\nI need to consider the social dynamics here. The author's friends are part of a group that's very sensitive about these issues, possibly influenced by Tumblr's culture. The key points are: the author expressed a personal belief (even if incorrect) in a private group, apologized, and respects their friends. However, the friend's SO is upset and publicly called out the author, which might have escalated the situation. The author feels they're being unfairly compared to more extreme anti-SJW groups.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't forcing their views, just stating their personal belief. The issue is the friend's SO's reaction and the group's sensitivity. The author is respecting their friend's identity (they say they respect them regardless of belief) but the disagreement in belief led to conflict. The question is whether the author's stance (not believing in genderfluidity) makes them wrong.\n\nIn many discussions, respecting a person's identity is key, even if one doesn't agree with their beliefs. However, the author isn't denying the friend's identity publicly or causing active harm beyond expressing a personal view. The problem is the friend's SO's overreaction. The author apologized and tried to maintain support. So, is it the author's fault? It's complicated. On one hand, the author expressed a belief that's considered invalidating by some. On the other, they didn't act maliciously and tried to make amends. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether expressing disbelief in a personal belief (genderfluidity) is inherently wrong. If the author's statement caused harm, even unintentionally, then they might be in the wrong. But if they're respecting the person's identity despite their personal views, maybe not. Since the author is supporting their friend's rights but not their identity belief, it's a nuanced situation. However, in social contexts, being called out for not believing in someone's gender identity can be seen as invalidating. The author might be in the wrong for not supporting their friend's self-identified gender, even if they don't personally believe in the concept. So, answer A (Yes).\n"
