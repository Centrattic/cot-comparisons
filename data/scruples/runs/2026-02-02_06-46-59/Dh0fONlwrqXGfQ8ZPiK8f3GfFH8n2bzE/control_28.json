Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not buying into a friend's genderfluidity. Let me break down the key points here.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as left-leaning and atheist, and they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain beliefs. They mention they keep their skepticism about genderfluidity to themselves unless in a discussion. The friend in question is in a relationship with an MTF (male-to-female) person and the friend has recently identified as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept but hasn't made a big deal about it unless discussing. \n\nThen there's the part where the friend's GF (girlfriend?) sent a message to the group, specifically mentioning the author, asking for support and not to be assholes. The GF also privately speculated that the author is trying to be trans. The friend seems to be inconsistent with their name and identity, changing names four times and sometimes using their birth name or identifying as male. The author thinks the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group because of the hostility they feel. The group is described as following a very sensitive, Tumblr-like ethos. \n\nThe author says they only once expressed not believing in genderfluidity, which was in context and under the influence of being stoned. They apologized and said they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. However, they are now being mocked for not being an \"SJW\" (social justice warrior). The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider a few things. First, does expressing personal skepticism about someone's gender identity, even if disbelieving, cross into being disrespectful or harmful? The author claims they keep their views private except in discussions. The friend's partner seems to think the author is trying to undermine the friend's identity, which could lead to tension. The author's avoidance of the group might be because of feeling hostility, but maybe they contributed to it by expressing their disbelief. \n\nIn many communities, especially those that are more progressive, questioning or not accepting someone's gender identity can be seen as invalidating and harmful, even if done in private. The fact that the author's friend changed names multiple times and has inconsistent identity might be part of their journey, and the author's skepticism could be perceived as not supporting that journey. \n\nHowever, the author did apologize and stated they respect their friends regardless. The key here might be the impact of their words. If the author's expression of disbelief caused harm, even if they didn't intend it, they might be considered in the wrong. Also, the friend's partner's reaction and the subsequent jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW types could be part of the conflict. \n\nSo, in terms of social norms, especially in modern discussions around gender identity, not accepting someone's self-identified gender can be seen as wrong. The author's actions, even if not overtly hostile, might be contributing to a hostile environment. The fact that they were called out by the friend's partner and are now being mocked by the group suggests that their actions are perceived negatively. \n\nTherefore, even if the author's intention wasn't to be harmful, the impact of their disbelief and the resulting avoidance might make them the asshole in the situation. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because not accepting a friend's gender identity can be seen as invalidating and harmful, regardless of personal beliefs.\n"
