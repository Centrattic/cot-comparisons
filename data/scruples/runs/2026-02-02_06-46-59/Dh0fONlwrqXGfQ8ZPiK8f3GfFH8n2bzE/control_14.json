Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping their thoughts to themselves except when discussing it. The key points here are the author's stance on genderfluidity, their behavior, and the reactions from their friend and group.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are left-leaning, atheist, and support equal rights despite personal disagreements. They don't oppose equal rights but don't believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out and making a group message. The friend changed names and identities frequently, leading the author to think they're being histrionic. The author apologized after causing hurt feelings but still faces jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issues here are respecting someone's identity versus personal beliefs. Even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, the friend identifies as such. The author's public statement of disbelief, even if in a discussion, might be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. The friend's GF's reaction suggests that the author's comment was hurtful. The author apologized, but the fact that they caused hurt feelings and were called out by their friend's partner implies they crossed a social boundary. \n\nIn many modern contexts, supporting someone's identity is considered respectful, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's stance might be seen as not respecting their friend's self-identified gender, which could be considered disrespectful or harmful. The friend's actions (changing names, identity confusion) might be genuine struggles, and the author's judgment could be seen as dismissive. \n\nHowever, the author claims they only expressed their disbelief once and apologized. But the context of being stoned and the subsequent fallout might downplay their intent, but the harm is still done. The key here is whether the author's expression of disbelief, even in a discussion, was inappropriate. Since the friend's partner took issue with it, and the group is sensitive, the author's comment might have been a breach of social norms, making them at fault. So the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
