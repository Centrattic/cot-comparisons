Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in their friend's genderfluidity but trying to keep it to themselves unless discussing it. The friend's significant other called them out in a group message, leading to some tension. The author admitted to being under the influence when making their comment and apologized, but now feels targeted with jokes about being an anti-SJW.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's friend identifies as genderfluid, which the author doesn't personally believe in but doesn't usually voice unless in a discussion. The author made a comment under the influence, apologized, and clarified they respect their friends regardless. However, the friend's GF seems to have taken offense, leading the author to avoid the group. The author is now being mocked for not aligning with certain social justice views.\n\nFrom a social perspective, respecting someone's identity is usually expected, even if one doesn't personally agree with it. The author's comment, even if made in a discussion context, might have been hurtful, and the apology seems insufficient if it's causing ongoing issues. The fact that the author is avoiding the group due to hostility might show they're aware their stance is causing discomfort. However, the author's insistence on their truth and the group's reaction could be a clash between personal belief and social sensitivity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In most discussions about identity, especially gender-related, the norm is to respect the individual's self-identification regardless of personal beliefs. The author's actions\u2014apologizing and affirming respect\u2014might mitigate some blame, but the initial comment and subsequent avoidance could be seen as dismissive. The friend's GF's reaction is also a factor; if the author's comment made them feel invalidated, that's problematic.\n\nBut the author also mentions they are an atheist and left-leaning, which typically aligns with progressive values. However, personal beliefs don't excuse hurting others. The key point is that the author's friend identifies as genderfluid, and the author's disbelief, even if unspoken, might contribute to a lack of support. The author's comment under the influence and the resulting apology might not fully address the hurt caused, especially if the friend's partner is upset.\n\nIn summary, while the author may have intended to keep their views private, the fact that their comment was still made and led to conflict suggests they might be in the wrong. The expectation in many circles is to respect others' identities, even if you disagree. The author's avoidance of the group could also be seen as a withdrawal of support, which is problematic. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
