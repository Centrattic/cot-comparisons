Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's friend being genderfluid, but the author doesn't believe in the concept and has caused some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are liberal and support equal rights but personally don't believe in genderfluidity. They made a comment while stoned, which led to being called out by the friend's girlfriend. The friend in question changes names and identities frequently without altering appearance or habits. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to their hostility towards the perceived oversensitivity and coddling.\n\nThe author apologized but is now facing jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, key points: The author's disbelief in genderfluidity isn't inherently wrong, but expressing that, especially when it affects others, could be problematic. They made a comment under the influence, which might have been inappropriate. Apologized, but the ongoing avoidance and the group's reaction suggest lingering issues. The friend's identity changes might be genuine, but the author is dismissing them, which could be invalidating. Even if the author's beliefs are personal, how they express them and treat others matters. The author's actions (avoiding the group, contributing to tension) might make them the asshole here. But if the friend is being inconsistent, maybe there's nuance. Still, respecting others' identities is generally expected, even if one doesn't agree with them. So, the author's stance and behavior likely made them wrong in this situation. Answer A.\n"
