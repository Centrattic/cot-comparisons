Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their Reddit post. The author is someone who identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights despite personal disagreements. They mention not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves, except once when they were stoned. The friend's GF (girlfriend?) called them out in a group message, leading to a situation where the author feels hostile towards the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's friend is genderfluid, and they've changed names multiple times. The author doesn't believe in the concept but hasn't vocalized it much except once under the influence. They apologized and affirmed respect. The key issue is whether the author's beliefs and actions make them wrong. \n\nFrom a social justice perspective, respecting someone's identity is crucial. Even if the author doesn't personally agree with genderfluidity, they should respect their friend's self-identification. The fact that they made a public comment (even under the influence) led to being called out, which is a common occurrence in such discussions. The author then distances themselves from the group, which might be seen as avoiding conflict, but it's also about feeling harassed. \n\nThe author did apologize and maintains respect, so their intention isn't to harm. However, the act of expressing disbelief in someone's identity, even once, can be hurtful and is often considered invalidating. The group's reaction (comparing them to anti-SJW types) might be an overreaction, but the core issue is the author's initial statement. \n\nLegally and socially, supporting someone's identity is expected, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's actions might not be malicious, but the impact is there. So, the answer would lean towards A, meaning they're in the wrong because they expressed a belief that invalidates their friend's identity, which can be harmful even if done once. However, the nuance is that they did apologize and respect the friend regardless. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about malice. The act itself of not believing in someone's identity is problematic, regardless of the circumstances. So A is the answer.\n"
