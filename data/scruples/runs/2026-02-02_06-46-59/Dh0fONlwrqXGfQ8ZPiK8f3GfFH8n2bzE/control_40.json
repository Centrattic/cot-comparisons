Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author posted on Reddit, using the \"Am I the Asshole?\" format. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is described as being very left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights. They don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain identities. The main issue is their stance on genderfluidity. The author doesn't believe in the concept but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThe situation involves a friend in a relationship who identifies as genderfluid. The friend's girlfriend sent a message to the group, specifically mentioning the author, urging support. The author was stoned when they made their comment about not believing in genderfluidity. The friend's GF speculates the friend might be \"trying out being trans,\" and the friend has had name changes and inconsistent identity expressions. \n\nThe author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group due to their hostility. The group is described as following \"over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr.\" The author apologized after the comment and affirmed respect for their friends regardless of personal beliefs. They're now getting mocked for not being a SJW.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that they don't believe in genderfluidity, which is a personal belief. However, they do claim to respect their friends. The problem arises from their public comment in a group chat, which was under the influence. The friend's GF took offense and called out the author specifically. The author apologized, which is a positive step.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if someone holds personal beliefs, it's important to respect others' identities, especially when those identities are part of their self-expression. The author's comment, while made in a private group and under the influence, was still hurtful and dismissive of a friend's identity. The fact that the friend's partner felt it necessary to single out the author suggests that the comment was particularly offensive.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize. The key issue is whether not believing in a certain identity makes someone an asshole if they express that belief in a context where it could be hurtful. The author's argument is that they didn't force their beliefs but kept it to themselves unless discussing. But in this case, they did express their disbelief in a situation where it caused discomfort. \n\nThe friend's identity is a personal matter, and even if the author doesn't agree, respecting their choice to identify as genderfluid is part of being a supportive friend. The author's avoidance due to feeling hostile might indicate a conflict between their personal beliefs and their social interactions. \n\nIn many modern discussions, the emphasis is on respecting others' identities regardless of personal agreement. So, even if the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity, expressing that disbelief in a way that offends can be seen as problematic. The apology might mitigate some of the harm, but the initial comment still contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for expressing their disbelief in a way that hurt their friend, despite apologizing afterward. The answer would likely be A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
