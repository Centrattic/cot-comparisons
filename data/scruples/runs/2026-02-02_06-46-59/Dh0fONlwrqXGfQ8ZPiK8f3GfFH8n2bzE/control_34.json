Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The situation is from a Reddit post where the author admits they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They mention a situation where they were stoned and made a comment, which led to some conflict. The friend's partner called out the author, and the friend has changed names and identities multiple times. The author now feels hostile towards the group and is being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's at stake here. The core issue is the author's belief vs. respecting someone else's identity. Gender identity is a sensitive topic, especially when it comes to others' self-perception. The author is in a group where they feel they're being accused of being an asshole, but they claim they apologize and respect their friends regardless.\n\nThe key points are: the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but hasn't publicly opposed it. They made a comment under the influence, apologized, and still respect their friends. However, they feel the group is oversensitive, like on Tumblr. The friend's name changes and identity fluidity are mentioned as reasons for the author's doubt.\n\nNow, societal norms and understanding of gender identity have evolved, and respecting someone's identity is generally seen as important, even if one personally doesn't agree. The author isn't denying their friend's identity but is not buying into the concept. However, by expressing doubt, even in a private conversation under the influence, it might have caused harm. The friend's partner felt the need to call out the author, indicating that the author's comment was hurtful or disrespectful.\n\nThe author claims to respect their friends despite their beliefs, but the act of not accepting someone's gender identity can be seen as invalidating. Even if the author isn't attacking, the mere disbelief might contribute to a hostile environment, especially if the friend is in a vulnerable position. The author's avoidance of the group could be seen as cutting off relationships due to disagreements, which might be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a group that's described as overly sensitive, and they might feel pressured to conform. The author's stance is that they don't support discrimination but don't personally believe in the concept. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about correctness of beliefs. In many modern perspectives, respecting someone's self-identified gender is considered necessary, regardless of personal beliefs. Therefore, the author's doubts, even if kept private, might be seen as transphobic or invalidating, leading to them being in the wrong.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author apologizing and trying to maintain respect. The fact that they apologized might mitigate some of the wrongness. However, the initial expression of disbelief, even under the influence, could have caused harm. The friend's partner's reaction suggests that it was indeed hurtful. So, while the author might not be a malicious person, their actions (or words) still caused issues, making them at least partially at fault.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's disbelief in genderfluidity, even if expressed in a private context and followed by an apology, could be seen as in the wrong because it invalidates a friend's identity. The harm caused by that doubt might outweigh the author's intentions. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
