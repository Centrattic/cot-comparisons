Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about genderfluidity and how the author's friend's partner reacted to the author not buying into the concept.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't really believe in the concept of genderfluidity but usually keep it to themselves unless discussing. Then, while stoned, they made a comment and were called out by their friend's GF. The GF mentioned them specifically in a group message asking for support, and even speculated the author is trying to be trans. The friend changes names a lot and sometimes uses their birth name or masculine pronouns. The author thinks their friend is being histrionic and avoids the group now because they feel hostility. They mentioned once saying they don't believe in genderfluidity, apologized when it was brought up, and affirmed respect despite personal beliefs. But now they're being compared to anti-SJW types in jokes.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respecting a friend's gender identity, even if you don't personally believe in it. The author's issue is not with equal rights, but with the concept of genderfluidity itself. Even though they apologized, their friend's partner is still upset and has shared it with the group. The author's avoidance might be due to feeling targeted or uncomfortable, but the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms and the concept of gender identity, it's generally considered important to respect a person's self-identified gender, regardless of one's own beliefs. Dismissing someone's identity can be hurtful, even if done so in a private conversation. However, the author did apologize and stated they respect their friend. But the GF is still bringing it up in group messages and making accusations, which could be part of the problem. The author's stance is personal belief, but the friend's partner's reaction is about not feeling supported. \n\nThe author was under the influence when they made the comment, but that's not an excuse. The key here is whether it's okay to express disbelief in someone's gender identity as long as they're not being discriminated against. But even if the author isn't opposing equal rights, the act of not buying into the concept could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. The friend changing names and identities might make it confusing, but the author's reaction could still be harmful, especially if the friend is in a vulnerable position. \n\nThe author's avoidance might be a result of tension, but the GF's approach of public shaming and implying the author is transgender without consent could be over the line. So the author's comment was inappropriate, but the GF's response might have escalated things. However, the main ethical issue is the author's initial disbelief in the friend's identity. Respecting others' identities is a common expectation, even if you personally don't agree with them. \n\nSo the answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) for expressing disbelief in their friend's gender identity, even if they later apologized. Because the friend's identity is their own, and the author shouldn't have questioned that, even if they don't believe in the concept. The GF's actions might be excessive, but the author's statement is the root of the problem here.\n"
