Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and the subsequent fallout with friends.\n\nFirst, the author states they're left-leaning and support equal rights but disagree with certain concepts like genderfluidity. They mention that their friend, who's in a relationship with a trans woman, is now identifying as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept but usually keeps it to themselves unless discussing. A conversation happened when the author was stoned, leading to the friend's girlfriend (GF) publicly calling them out in a group message. The GF speculated that the friend might be trying out being trans. The author then points out the friend's inconsistency in name changes and gender identity, suggesting they're being histrionic. The author has avoided the group due to feeling hostility, and the friends are described as following \"over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr.\" The author once expressed disbelief in genderfluidity, was under the influence, apologized, and respects their friends despite their beliefs. They're now being mocked for not being an \"SJW extremist.\"\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nKey points to consider: The author's personal belief vs. respecting others' identities. Expressing disbelief in a concept (genderfluidity) that others identify with can be hurtful, even if done in private. The author's comments led to public shaming by the GF. The friend changing names and identities frequently might be part of their journey, but the author's judgment of them as \"histrionic\" is dismissive. Even if the author apologized, the initial statement and the ongoing avoidance could be seen as not supporting their friend's identity. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's identity, even if you don't personally believe in the concept, is generally expected. The author's public disagreement (even when under the influence) and subsequent withdrawal might be seen as not respecting their friend's self-identified gender. The friends reacting with hostility might be a result of feeling invalidated. \n\nHowever, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and apologize. They also mention being under the influence. But the main issue is whether expressing disbelief in someone's identity is acceptable. Most modern views prioritize respecting individual identity over personal beliefs. So, the author's stance might be considered hurtful and disrespectful, making them in the wrong. \n\nBut there's also a nuance here. The author isn't directly attacking the friend but expressing disbelief in a concept. But when that disbelief leads to public criticism and the friend's identity is invalidated, it can be harmful. The friend's GF's reaction is part of the dynamic, but the author's role in sparking that is significant. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author apologizes and supports equal rights, their initial statement and ongoing judgment of their friend's identity as \"histrionic\" and their withdrawal from the group likely contributed to the conflict. Respecting someone's self-identified gender is a key part of being a supportive friend. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
