Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not buying their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a left-leaning atheist who supports equal rights but doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They had a conversation while stoned where they expressed this disbelief. The friend's girlfriend called them out publicly, leading to tension. The author now feels targeted and is avoiding the group, which they describe as overly sensitive like Tumblr.\n\nThe key points are: the author expressed personal disbelief in genderfluidity once, under the influence, and apologized. The friend's partner took offense and spread rumors that the author was trying to be anti-SJW. The author is now distancing themselves but claims to respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nNow, considering social dynamics, when someone's identity is questioned or disbelieved, even if the person says they're respecting others, it can cause harm. The author admitted to not believing in genderfluidity, which is a part of someone's self-identity. Even if they apologized, the initial statement might have been hurtful. The friend's partner's reaction suggests that the comment was taken as invalidating their friend's identity. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's statement directly challenged their friend's identity. While they did apologize, the fact that they made such a statement in a group chat where the friend's partner felt compelled to defend them shows that the author's words had negative repercussions. The author claims to support equal rights, but their action here contradicts that by not respecting their friend's self-identified genderfluidity.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions avoiding the group due to hostility, which might be a result of their own actions. The friend's partner's public call-out and the subsequent jokes comparing the author to anti-SJWs could be a consequence of the author's initial comment.\n\nSo, even if the author is left-leaning and supports equal rights, their personal disbelief expressed in a group setting, especially under the influence, contributed to the conflict. The main issue is respecting someone's self-identified gender, which is a fundamental aspect of supporting their rights. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not affirming their friend's identity, despite their personal beliefs.\n"
