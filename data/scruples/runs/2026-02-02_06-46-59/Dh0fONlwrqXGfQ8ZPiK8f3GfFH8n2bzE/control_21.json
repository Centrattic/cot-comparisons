Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is about whether not believing in genderfluidity makes someone an asshole, especially in the context of their friend's situation.\n\nFirst, the author says they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They mentioned this during a stoned conversation, which led to their friend's girlfriend calling them out. The friend has been changing names and identities, and the author feels their friend is being histrionic. The author also avoids the group because they find the environment too sensitive and coddled, like on Tumblr.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author didn't outright reject their friend's identity but expressed personal disbelief. They apologized and affirmed respect. However, the friend's partner felt targeted, and the author is now being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nI need to consider the social context. Gender identity is a sensitive topic. Even if someone has personal beliefs, how they express them matters. The author was under the influence when they made the comment, which might have been a poor time to discuss such a sensitive issue. Also, the fact that the friend changed names and identities multiple times could indicate genuine struggle, but the author's view might be dismissive of that.\n\nThe author did apologize and respects their friends regardless, so maybe they aren't malicious. But the issue is whether expressing disbelief, even privately and then apologizing, is wrong. In many modern contexts, especially in supportive communities, questioning someone's gender identity can be seen as invalidating. The author's avoidance due to not agreeing with the group's sensitivity might come off as dismissive too.\n\nHowever, the line is blurry. The author isn't attacking the friend directly but has their own beliefs. But when it comes to someone's identity, even if they don't fully accept a concept, they should be cautious not to invalidate others' experiences. The friend's partner felt targeted, which suggests the comment had a negative impact.\n\nSo, the author's stance is problematic because it's about respecting the friend's self-identified gender, even if they don't personally believe in the concept. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their disbelief led to hurt feelings and exclusion. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they apologized and respect the friend regardless. But the impact of the comment and the resulting avoidance might tip it towards A.\n"
