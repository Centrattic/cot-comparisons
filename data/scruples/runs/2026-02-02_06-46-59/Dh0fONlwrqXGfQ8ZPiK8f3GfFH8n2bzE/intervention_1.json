Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't believe in genderfluidity and once said so when they were stoned, which led to their friend's girlfriend being upset. The friend is in a long-distance relationship with a trans woman and a genderfluid person. The author also mentions avoiding the group because of hostility after the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the author did. They expressed a personal belief that they don't buy into genderfluidity. Even though they were under the influence and apologized, the friend's GF called them out in a group message. The author is left-leaning and doesn't oppose equal rights, but they have a hard time accepting genderfluidity as a real concept. \n\nNow, the question is whether this makes the author the asshole. The key points here are about respecting others' identities and the context in which the statement was made. Even if the author disagrees with genderfluidity, publicly stating that they \"don't buy it\" could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, especially in a group setting where the friend might be present. The friend changing names and identities multiple times might add to the perception that this is a sensitive topic. \n\nThe author did apologize, which is a positive step, but the act of expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity, regardless of the person's stance on other social issues, can be harmful. The friend's GF and the group's reaction suggests that the author's comment was hurtful. The author's avoidance of the group after that might be a consequence of the tension caused by their comment.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette and respecting others' identities, even if you disagree, it's generally considered respectful to acknowledge their self-identification. The author's stance could be seen as not respecting their friend's identity, even if they claim to support equal rights otherwise. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the impact of their words on their friend's relationship and the subsequent avoidance of the group. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) if they think personal beliefs shouldn't be forced on others as long as rights are respected. But the main issue here is the public expression of disbelief and the resulting conflict, which is a social faux pas, even if not illegal or rights-violating. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
