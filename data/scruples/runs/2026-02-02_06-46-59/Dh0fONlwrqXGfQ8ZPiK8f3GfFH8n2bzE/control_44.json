Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is part of a group of friends. One of their friends is in a long-distance relationship with an MTF (male-to-female) person, and the friend in question recently identifies as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThen, the author was stoned when they said they don't believe in genderfluidity, and the friend's GF (girlfriend?) called out the author directly in a group message, implying the author is being an asshole. The GF also speculated that the author is trying to say the friend is trans. The author's friend is changing names a lot, using different pronouns, and the author thinks the friend is being histrionic. The author has avoided the group because of the hostility and mentions they're being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA). So the central question is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in genderfluidity and expressing that opinion, even if they apologized and said they respect their friends regardless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is part of a left-leaning group, which generally supports gender identities. The author's friend identifies as genderfluid, which is a recognized gender identity for many people. The author, however, doesn't believe in the concept, which can be problematic because it dismisses someone's identity. \n\nEven though the author says they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs, the act of not buying into someone else's identity can be hurtful. The author admitted to saying this in a group setting (even if stoned) and caused the friend's GF to call them out. The GF's reaction suggests that the comment was taken as offensive or dismissive, possibly leading to tension in the friendship.\n\nThe author's justification is that they only made the comment once, in context, and apologized. But if the friend is genuinely genderfluid, the author's disbelief can be seen as invalidating their experience. Dismissing someone's gender identity, even if done once and with an apology, can still be harmful. The fact that the friend has changed names multiple times and the author sees it as histrionic might indicate the author is judging the friend's self-expression, which is part of their identity.\n\nThe author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility might also contribute to the problem, as it shows a lack of willingness to engage and support their friends despite disagreements. The comparison to anti-SJW types suggests the author is being criticized as intolerant, even if that's not their intention.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's identity is generally considered important, even if one personally disagrees. The author's statement that they \"don't believe in the concept\" of genderfluidity is problematic because it undermines the validity of someone else's identity. While freedom of belief exists, expressing disbelief in a way that's hurtful or dismissive can be seen as being in the wrong, especially if it causes harm to a friend's sense of acceptance and support.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author expressed disbelief in a friend's gender identity, which caused tension and was called out for being an asshole. Even with an apology, the initial statement likely hurt their friend and contributed to the group's hostility. The author's right to hold a personal belief must be balanced against the impact on their friend's well-being. In this case, the author is probably in the wrong because their disbelief was expressed in a context that caused harm, despite their eventual apology and personal respect. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
