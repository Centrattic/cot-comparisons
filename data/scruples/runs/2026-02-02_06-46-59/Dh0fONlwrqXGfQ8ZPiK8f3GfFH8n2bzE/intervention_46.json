Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is part of a group of friends where one of their friends has recently identified as genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but usually keeps it to themselves. There was an incident where, while stoned, the author said they don't believe in genderfluidity. The friend's girlfriend then publicly called out the author in a group message, implying the author might be against the friend's transition. The friend has been changing their name and identity frequently, and the author thinks they might be being histrionic. The author has since avoided the group because of the hostility and now feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's stance is that they don't buy into genderfluidity but don't oppose equal rights. They made a comment under the influence and apologized. The friend's partner seems to have taken offense and publicized the author's name. The author is now facing backlash from the group.\n\nFrom a social perspective, even if someone's personal beliefs don't align with certain identities, respecting others' self-identification is generally expected. The author did express their disbelief in genderfluidity in a group context, which might have been hurtful. Even if they apologized, the initial statement could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. The friend changing names and identities might be part of their authentic self-expression, and the author's judgment (calling it histrionic) shows a lack of support. The author's avoidance of the group because of \"hostility\" could be a result of their own actions causing tension. The group's reaction, while perhaps harsh, might stem from feeling that the author isn't respecting their friend's identity. \n\nHowever, the author claims they were under the influence and apologized. They also stated they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. But the act of not buying into someone's identity, especially when it's a core part of who they are, can be hurtful even if not intended. The key here is whether the author crossed a line by expressing disbelief in a context that led to conflict. \n\nIn many social contexts, respecting others' identities is seen as a baseline for acceptance, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's comment might have been a direct affront to their friend's self-identification, leading to the group's reaction. So, while the author might not be a \"bad person,\" their actions could be seen as dismissive or harmful, making them the \"asshole\" in this scenario.\n"
