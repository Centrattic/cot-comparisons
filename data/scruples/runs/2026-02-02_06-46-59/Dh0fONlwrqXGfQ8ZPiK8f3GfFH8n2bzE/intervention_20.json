Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity.\n\nFirst, the author states they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They had a conversation while stoned where they expressed this disbelief. The friend's GF mentioned the author specifically in a group message asking for support, and there's speculation the friend might be exploring being trans. The author feels targeted and is avoiding the group because of the hostility from the friends who are being overly sensitive, likening them to Tumblr culture. The author apologized after the incident but is now facing jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's main issue is their disbelief in genderfluidity. However, they did apologize and respect their friend despite their personal beliefs. The friends might be reacting to the author's expressed doubt, especially in a public group message. The key points here are: the author's personal belief vs. respecting their friend's identity, whether the expression of disbelief was hurtful, and the subsequent avoidance and jokes from the group.\n\nThe author claims they only mentioned their disbelief once, in context, and were under the influence. They took responsibility and affirmed respect. The friends might be coddling their friend's identity, but the author isn't attacking them directly. However, by not buying into the identity, even if the friend is genderfluid, it's their right to express their identity. The author isn't forcing their views but is choosing not to acknowledge the identity. But in terms of being an asshole, it's about causing harm. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's identity, but they're also standing by their beliefs. However, the main wrong here is likely the author's refusal to accept the friend's identity, even if it's genuine. But the friend might also be histrionic, as the author suggests. However, the author's stance might invalidate their friend's experience, which can be harmful regardless of the truth of the identity. So, the author is in the wrong for invalidating their friend's identity, even if they apologize later. But the friends might be overreacting too. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
