Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author posted on Reddit about not believing in genderfluidity and feeling conflicted about their friend's identity. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning and supportive of equal rights, even when they disagree. They mention that a friend of theirs is genderfluid, but the author doesn't believe in the concept. There was a situation where the friend's girlfriend publicly called out the author for being an asshole, possibly because the author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity while under the influence. The author apologized and clarified their respect, but the friends still treated them poorly, comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the author's personal belief conflicting with their friend's identity. The author didn't outright attack or discriminate but expressed a personal disbelief in a context where others are very sensitive. \n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, respecting someone's identity is generally considered important, even if one doesn't personally agree with it. The author's public expression of disbelief, even while stoned, could be seen as dismissive or invalidating to the friend's experience. However, the author did apologize and stated their respect, so maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. \n\nBut the key point is the impact of their words. The friend's partner felt the need to publicly call out the author, which shows that the author's statement hurt feelings and created tension. The author's avoidance of the group might be a reaction to the hostility, but it's also possible that their initial comment contributed to that hostility. \n\nIn many social justice contexts, expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity can be harmful, even if done in a private conversation. The fact that the author was under the influence might mitigate some responsibility, but not entirely. People are still expected to be considerate of others' identities regardless of their state.\n\nHowever, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and affirming respect. The friends' reaction might be over the top, especially if they're following a \"coddling ethos,\" as the author mentions. There's a balance between respecting personal beliefs and not being forced to endorse them.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? They expressed a belief that may be harmful but didn't act with malice, and they apologized. Their friends might have overreacted, but the author's choice to express disbelief in a context where others are sensitive could be problematic. On the other hand, in a group where such discussions are common, the author might have a right to their opinion if expressed respectfully. However, the context here was a group that values sensitivity, so the author's statement might have been inappropriate even if they apologized later.\n\nI think the answer depends on societal norms around respecting identities versus personal beliefs. Since the author's disbelief is a personal belief but the expression of it caused harm, they might be in the wrong. However, if the friends were too sensitive, the author might not be entirely at fault. But in most cases, respecting someone's identity is prioritized over personal disbelief, especially in a supportive group. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's identity, even if they later apologized.\n"
