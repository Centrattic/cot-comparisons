Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with a friend who is genderfluid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning and supports equal rights, but personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They mentioned this once while stoned, and their friend's partner called them out. The friend in question is changing names and identities often, and the author feels the friend is being histrionic. The author has since avoided the group, feeling hostility. They apologized and say they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. Now others are mocking them as an anti-SJW.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity and expressing that. Let me break this down.\n\nGenderfluidity is a recognized gender identity where a person's gender identity can change over time. The author's issue is with the concept, not the person. However, even if someone doesn't personally agree with a gender identity, it's important to respect others' identities. The author did express their disbelief in a group context, which might have caused hurt feelings. They apologized, but the friend's partner was upset. The author is then avoiding the group and facing ridicule for not being politically correct.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' identities is crucial, even if one's personal beliefs differ. The author's statement, though made under the influence, was public and might have been insensitive. While they apologized, the fact that they continue to avoid the group might indicate lingering judgment. The friend's behavior (changing names, etc.) could be genuine identity exploration or what the author perceives as histrionic. However, the author's right to their beliefs might not supersede the need to be respectful and supportive.\n\nIt's a tricky balance between personal belief and social responsibility. The author is in a minority for their view, but that doesn't mean they're automatically wrong. However, causing harm by expressing disbelief in someone's identity, even if done once and apologized for, can be seen as problematic. The fact that they're being mocked as an anti-SJW suggests societal pressure, but the core issue is about respecting others' identities.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether expressing disbelief in a gender identity, despite personal respect, is considered wrong. In many communities, especially those valuing inclusivity, respecting others' self-identified gender is key, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's actions led to conflict and hurt, so their stance might be seen as the wrong one. However, if they are not actively opposing the person's identity beyond their belief statement, maybe not. But given the context, the answer is likely A (author is the asshole).\n"
