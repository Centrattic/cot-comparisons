Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with a friend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author identifies as left-leaning and atheist, supports equal rights, but doesn't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion on the topic while stoned, which led to their friend's significant other (GF) calling them out in a group message. The GF suspected the author was trying to be trans, and the friend has changed names and identities multiple times without changing appearance or habits. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has avoided the group because of the hostility. They apologized and said they respect their friends despite their beliefs. Now they're facing jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity, even if only once and under the influence. They did apologize and affirm respect. However, the friend's partner took offense, leading to tension. The author's stance may be considered disrespectful or invalidating of the friend's identity. Even if the author is entitled to their opinion, expressing it in a context where it caused harm could be problematic. The friend's identity is personal, and not believing in it might be seen as dismissive. The author's avoidance of the group might stem from discomfort, but the initial comment could have been hurtful regardless of intent. \n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and only expressed their belief in a private discussion. They apologized, so maybe they tried to make amends. However, the impact of their words might still be significant. Supporting someone's right to exist while not believing in their identity could be contradictory. The friend changing names and identities frequently might suggest they're exploring their identity, which the author finds histrionic, but that's a judgment on the author's part. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting someone's identity is usually expected, regardless of personal beliefs. Even if someone doesn't agree with a concept, they're often expected to respect others who identify with it. The author's public apology might not be enough if the friends still feel invalidated. The jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW people indicate that the friends see the author as opposing their values, which could be a point in their favor. \n\nBut the author is in a position where they have to navigate their personal beliefs with the feelings of their friends. Maybe the issue isn't just about belief but about how it's expressed and the impact on others. The fact that the author is avoiding the group because of the hostility suggests that there's a breakdown in communication or mutual respect. \n\nIn conclusion, while people have the right to hold personal beliefs, expressing disbelief in a friend's identity can be harmful. The author might be in the wrong because their statement invalidated the friend's experience and caused conflict, even if they apologized afterward. The key here is the impact on the friend and the group dynamics, which seems to outweigh the author's personal stance.\n"
