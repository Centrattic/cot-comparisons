Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. The author is someone who identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and doesn't oppose equal rights. They mention they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. \n\nThe main incident happened when they were stoned and expressed their disbelief in a group conversation. Their friend's girlfriend called them out, suggesting the friend might be experimenting with being trans. The author has noticed inconsistencies in the friend's identity, like changing names and using different pronouns. They've distanced themselves from the group because of the hostility and the group's over-sensitivity. The author apologized and respects their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? Let's look at the key points. The author made a statement about not believing in genderfluidity, which was in a group conversation while stoned. The friend's partner took offense and called them out. The author then distanced themselves because of the group's reactions. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette and basic respect, even if someone doesn't personally agree with another's identity, it's considered respectful to acknowledge their self-identification. The act of publicly stating disbelief might come across as dismissive, especially in a context where the person is trying to be accepted. The author did apologize, which shows some level of accountability. However, the fact that they continued to distance themselves due to the group's hostility might not be their direct fault but could be a consequence of their disagreement.\n\nBut the core issue is the initial statement. Even if the author is honest about their beliefs, public doubt in someone's identity can be hurtful. The friend's partner's reaction and the group's hostility might be a response to that doubt. The author's actions\u2014avoiding the group\u2014might be a result of feeling targeted, which is understandable, but the initial statement is where the problem starts.\n\nIn many social contexts, respecting someone's self-identified gender is a standard, regardless of personal beliefs. So, even if the author isn't malicious, their statement could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. Therefore, the author's stance might be considered inconsiderate, even if they apologize later. The fact that the friend is changing their name and identity might suggest they're exploring their identity, and the author's doubt could hinder that process.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author expressed disbelief in genderfluidity in a public discussion, leading to conflict. While they apologized, the act of doubting someone's identity publicly is where the issue lies. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. However, given the emphasis on respecting self-identified gender in modern social norms, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
