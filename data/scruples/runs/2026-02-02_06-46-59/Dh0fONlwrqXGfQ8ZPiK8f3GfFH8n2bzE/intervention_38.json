Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is left-leaning, atheist, doesn't oppose equal rights but disagrees with genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned, which led to their friend's girlfriend (GF) being upset. The GF speculated that the author was trying to say the friend is trans. The friend changes names and identities often without changing appearance or habits. The author now avoids the group because they find them too sensitive, comparing them to Tumblr's over-sensitivity. The author apologized after saying they don't believe in genderfluidity and clarified they respect their friends regardless.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the author's beliefs are their own, and they did apologize. They stated they don't oppose equal rights, so their stance isn't about discrimination. But expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity, even if done so privately, can be hurtful. The friend's GF took offense, and the author's comments might invalidate the friend's identity. The author's avoidance might be due to discomfort with the group's sensitivity, but maybe they should have tried to support the friend regardless of their beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the author clarified their position in context and took responsibility by apologizing. They respect their friends' rights, so maybe they aren't the asshole. However, the act of not buying into someone's gender identity, even if they don't act on it, could be seen as dismissive. The friend changing names and identities might complicate things, but that doesn't negate the person's experience. The author's public stance against genderfluidity, even under the influence, led to conflict. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being respectful and affirming someone's identity is often prioritized, even if one personally doesn't agree. The author's actions might have caused harm despite their intentions. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they expressed disbelief in a way that hurt their friend, even if they apologized. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) because they don't oppose rights and apologized. But the main issue is invalidating someone's identity, which can be harmful regardless of intent. So leaning towards A.\n"
