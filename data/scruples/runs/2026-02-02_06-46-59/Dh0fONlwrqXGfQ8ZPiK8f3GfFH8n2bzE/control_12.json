Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. The situation involves the author expressing doubt about the concept of genderfluidity, especially after being called out by their friend's partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they are generally supportive of equal rights and keep their skepticism private unless discussing it. They were under the influence when they made the comment. The friend's partner was upset and implied the author was being an asshole. The author apologized and affirmed respect for their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention to be respectful and their subsequent apology. While the author's disbelief in genderfluidity is a personal belief, the main question is whether expressing that belief in a private discussion, under the influence, and then apologizing makes them the asshole. \n\nHowever, the author is being targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types, which might indicate that the friends are being overly sensitive. The author is trying to navigate their beliefs while maintaining respect. \n\nBut is not believing in a gender identity inherently wrong? The author isn't attacking the person but questioning the concept. However, in terms of respecting someone's identity, even if you don't agree with the concept, the person's self-identification should be acknowledged. The author's friend is genderfluid, so the author's refusal to accept that could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity. \n\nBut the author says they keep it to themselves unless discussing, which they did under the influence. Then they apologized. The question is whether the initial statement was harmful enough to make the author in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the friend is changing names and identities frequently, maybe the author is concerned about sincerity. However, regardless of the friend's consistency, the author's right to hold that belief is there, but the way it's expressed matters. Since the author apologized and respects their friend's identity, maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nBut in terms of social norms, especially in modern discussions around gender identity, not believing in genderfluidity can be seen as transphobic. Even if the author is respectful, their disbelief might still be harmful. The partner's reaction suggests that the comment was hurtful. \n\nSo, the balance is between personal belief and the impact on others. The author tried to apologize, but the harm was already done. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expressing their skepticism in a way that hurt their friend's partner and caused tension in the group.\n"
