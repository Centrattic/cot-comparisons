Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluidity. The situation is presented as a \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post on Reddit.\n\nFirst, the author identifies as being very left-leaning and supportive of equal rights, even when they disagree with certain views. They mention not buying into genderfluidity but usually keeping it to themselves unless discussing it. The key incident here is when they were stoned and expressed their disbelief, leading to their friend's girlfriend publicly calling them out and implying the author is anti-SJW. The friend in question is genderfluid and has changed their name multiple times, which the author finds histrionic. The author apologized and respects their friends despite their beliefs but feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the author's personal disbelief in their friend's gender identity and whether that's acceptable. The author did express this disbelief once, under the influence, and later apologized. However, respecting someone's identity is different from believing in it. The author claims to respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs, but their actions (avoiding the group, being called out by the friend's partner) suggest conflict.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and current understanding, respecting people's self-identified gender is widely supported. Even if someone doesn't personally agree with a gender identity, it's considered important to respect that person's identity. The author's statement that they \"don't believe in the concept\" could be seen as invalidating their friend's experience, which is a sensitive issue. The fact that the friend is changing names and has identity slips might be part of their journey, and the author's judgment could be hurtful even if they apologize later.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize and says they respect the friend regardless. The problem is that expressing disbelief in a friend's identity, even once, can be hurtful and contribute to a hostile environment, especially in a group that values sensitivity. The friend's partner's public message might indicate that the group is particularly sensitive to such issues. The author's avoidance of the group could be seen as a result of their discomfort, which might not be fair to the friends involved.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author claims to respect their friends, their disbelief in the genderfluidity and the way they expressed it (even under the influence) likely caused harm. The key point is that respecting someone's identity is about acknowledging their experience, not necessarily agreeing with it. So, the author's stance, even if personal, might be considered inconsiderate or harmful in this context. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
