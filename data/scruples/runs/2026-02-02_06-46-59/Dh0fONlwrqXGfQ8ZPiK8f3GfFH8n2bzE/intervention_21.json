Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves except for when they were stoned. The friend's partner accused them of being an asshole, and the author is now being compared to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, supporting equal rights. They mention they don't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. The issue is their stance on genderfluidity, which they don't believe in but usually keep to themselves. However, when they were stoned, they expressed this disbelief, leading to conflict. The friend's partner felt the author was being hostile, and the author now avoids the group due to their hostility towards the over-sensitivity and Tumblr ethos.\n\nThe author apologized and said they respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. But the group is comparing them to anti-SJW individuals, which is causing tension. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a perspective of respecting others' identities, even if one doesn't agree with the concept, the act of expressing disbelief, especially in a context where others are already sensitive, could be seen as harmful. The author did apologize, which shows some accountability, but the fact that their comment was made in a group where others are transitioning or genderfluid might add context. The partner's message directly called out the author, indicating that their words were hurtful.\n\nEven if the author was under the influence, that doesn't excuse the impact of their words. The key here is that the author's personal beliefs caused discomfort and led to being ostracized. In a left-leaning community that values acceptance and support, challenging someone's gender identity can be seen as opposing their rights, even if done in a private conversation. The author's avoidance of the group due to \"hostility\" might be a reflection of their own discomfort rather than the group's unfounded coddling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights, so their stance is not about denying rights but disagreeing with the concept. However, the way they expressed this disagreement (even if once) under the influence and in a context where others are vulnerable (friends dealing with gender identity) can be problematic. The partner's reaction and the subsequent jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW types suggest that the conflict is real and ongoing.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong not for their belief but for how they expressed it, especially given the context and the impact on their friend and their partner. The apology is good, but the initial action still caused harm, which is why the group is reacting negatively. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
