Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author says they don't believe in genderfluidity but keep their thoughts to themselves unless discussing it. They mention being stoned when they expressed their disbelief, then a friend's girlfriend (GF) publicly called them out in a group message. The GF speculated that the author was targeting their partner, who is genderfluid. The partner has been changing their name multiple times and sometimes uses their birth name or refers to themselves as male. The author feels the friend is being histrionic and has been avoiding the group because they feel hostile, which they attribute to the group's Tumblr-like sensitivity. The author apologizes for any hurt feelings and states they respect their friends despite their beliefs. They also mention being mocked as part of anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's main issue is not buying into genderfluidity. They made a statement when they were stoned, which led to conflict. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in genderfluidity and avoiding a friend group over it.\n\nLegally and socially, in many places, respecting someone's gender identity is expected. Gender identity is a personal experience, and being trans or genderfluid is a valid aspect of some people's identity. Even if someone doesn't believe it's real, they're expected to respect others' identities. The author's statement about not believing in genderfluidity could be seen as invalidating the friend's identity, even if they didn't express it publicly except once (when stoned). The fact that the friend changes names and uses different pronouns might indicate they're still figuring out their identity, but the author's public disapproval, even under the influence, could be hurtful.\n\nThe author apologizes and says they still respect their friends, but the act of not buying into the friend's identity might be considered disrespectful. The author is avoiding the group due to feeling hostility from others, which might be a result of their own comment. The group's reaction is part of the dynamic here. The author is caught between their personal beliefs and the social expectations of respecting others' identities, even if they disagree.\n\nIn terms of social norms, especially in progressive circles, being dismissive of someone's gender identity can be seen as harmful. The author's stance might be viewed as insensitive, even if they don't hold others' rights. The fact that their friend changed names and has inconsistent self-identification could be part of the confusion, but the author's public doubt might contribute to the friend's stress.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong for not believing in genderfluidity. While everyone has the right to their own beliefs, expressing disbelief in someone's identity, especially when it's part of their self-concept, can be harmful. The author's actions led to conflict, and even though they apologized, the initial statement might still be considered hurtful. The author is in a group that's sensitive to such issues, so their comment might have crossed a line, even if made in a specific context (stoned). The fact that they avoided the group afterward suggests they felt the backlash was justified or too intense, but the root issue is their disbelief.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's not being in the wrong (B) would require that their disbelief doesn't equate to wrongdoing, especially if they didn't act maliciously. However, if respecting someone's identity is expected, then their disbelief could be seen as wrong because it's invalidating. The key points are the public nature of the comment (even if stoned), the resulting conflict, and the friend's experience. The author's perspective is that they're left-leaning and respectful of rights, but their personal disbelief still caused issues. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because respecting someone's identity is separate from believing in it, and their actions (public doubt) contributed to the conflict.\n"
