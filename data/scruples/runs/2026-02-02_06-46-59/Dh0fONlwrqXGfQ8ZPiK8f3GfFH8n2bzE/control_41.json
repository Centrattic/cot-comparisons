Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and how that affected their friendship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are left-leaning and an atheist, and they don't oppose equal rights despite personal disagreements. But they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity. They were stoned when they expressed this disbelief, and then their friend's GF (girlfriend?) called them out in a group message. The friend's partner speculated that the author might be trying to say the friend is trans. \n\nThe friend changes their name four times and slips up on their identity, leading the author to think they're being histrionic. The author has avoided the group because of the hostility and feels they're being compared to anti-SJW types. The author apologized for hurting feelings but still holds their belief.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity, which is a personal opinion. However, doing so in a group message, even when stoned, can be seen as insensitive. The friend's partner took it personally and called them out. The author's friend is genderfluid and changing names, which can be part of their identity journey. The author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility might have caused further issues. While the author claims they respect the friend regardless of their belief, the act of not buying into someone's identity can be hurtful, especially when that identity is important to the person. \n\nThe author apologized but the impact of their words and behavior might still be harmful. The friend's partner feeling the need to defend them suggests that the author's actions were not respectful. Even if the author thinks the friend is being histrionic, it's not their place to judge someone's identity. \n\nSo, the author's stance is about personal belief, but the way they expressed it and the subsequent actions (avoiding the group, not supporting the friend's identity) could be seen as harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's identity even if they don't personally agree with the concept.\n"
