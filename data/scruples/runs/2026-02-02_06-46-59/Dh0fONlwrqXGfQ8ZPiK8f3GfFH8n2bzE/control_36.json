Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's start by breaking down the key points from the post.\n\nThe author identifies as left-leaning, atheist, and doesn't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain concepts. They mention that they don't believe in genderfluidity but usually keep their opinions to themselves, except when discussing. The situation arises when a friend comes out as genderfluid, and the author was under the influence (stoned) when they expressed their disbelief. The friend's partner accused the author of being an asshole and speculated the friend was just \"trying out being trans.\" The author changed their name multiple times and sometimes slips up on their identity. The author avoids the group due to feeling hostility, which they associate with the group's Tumblr-like sensitivity. They apologized and stated they respect their friends regardless, but now face jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nFirst, the author's stance on genderfluidity is a belief they hold but try to keep private. However, when they did express it under the influence, it caused hurt. The key issue here is whether expressing disbelief in a concept, especially under the influence, is wrong. The author apologized and reaffirmed respect, which shows they are trying to be considerate.\n\nThe friend's partner's reaction and the group's hostility might be contributing factors. The author is avoiding the group because of this, which complicates the social dynamics. The author isn't attacking the person for being genderfluid but questioning the concept. However, in modern social contexts, supporting someone's identity is often expected, even if one doesn't personally believe in the concept. The author's private belief vs. public expression is a point here. They did express their disbelief in a context where it might have been inappropriate, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nThe author's actions led to conflict, and while they apologized, the ongoing avoidance and the group's reaction suggest that the author's stance is causing social friction. The question is whether this makes them the asshole. The answer hinges on whether it's acceptable to hold personal beliefs that conflict with widely accepted social norms, especially when those beliefs are expressed in a way that harms others.\n\nIn many current social frameworks, respecting someone's identity is considered a baseline, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's disbelief in genderfluidity, when expressed, may be seen as invalidating the person's experience, which can be hurtful. The fact that the author is avoiding the group because of the hostility they feel might be a defense mechanism, but it doesn't absolve them of the initial hurt caused.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's expression of disbelief under the influence and the resulting conflict might place them in the wrong, even if their intent wasn't malicious. Their actions contributed to the situation, and despite apologizing, the impact is still present. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
