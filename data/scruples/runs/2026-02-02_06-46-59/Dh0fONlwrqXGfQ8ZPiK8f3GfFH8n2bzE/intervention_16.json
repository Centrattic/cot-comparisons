Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author identifies as left-leaning and supports equal rights even if they disagree with certain beliefs. The friend in question is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in that concept. They had a discussion while stoned, and the friend's girlfriend mentioned the author specifically, possibly because the author had expressed skepticism. The friend has changed their name multiple times and has inconsistencies in identity presentation. The author has since avoided the group due to feeling hostility and mentions they were under the influence when they expressed their disbelief.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks A is correct but wants confirmation. \n\nI should think about the context. The author claims to respect their friends regardless of personal beliefs. However, expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity can be hurtful. Even if the author apologized, the act of not acknowledging someone's identity can be seen as invalidating. The friends might feel that the author's skepticism is a form of discrimination or disrespect, especially in a group that's sensitive to such issues. \n\nThe author's avoidance of the group could be seen as a consequence of the conflict, but their initial statement about not believing in genderfluidity might have contributed to the tension. Even if the author was under the influence, the statement still caused harm. The key issue here is whether the author was wrong to express their disbelief, even if they later apologized.\n\nIn many social contexts, especially those that prioritize sensitivity, questioning someone's identity can be considered harmful, regardless of intent. The fact that the author called into question the friend's gender identity might be seen as the wrong action, hence making the author (AITA) at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and respect the individual. However, the act of not believing in the concept itself could still be problematic. So, putting it all together, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not supporting their friend's identity, even if they don't personally agree with it.\n"
