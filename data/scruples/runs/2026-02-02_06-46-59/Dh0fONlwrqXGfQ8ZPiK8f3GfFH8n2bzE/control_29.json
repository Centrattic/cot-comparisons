Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not believing in genderfluidity but keeping their opinions to themselves unless discussing. Then, after a friend's girlfriend called them out and there was some conflict, the author felt hostility and distanced themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author claims they don't oppose equal rights but don't believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned, which led to the friend's GF making them feel targeted. The author apologized and respects their friends but now faces jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The core issue is the author's belief (or lack thereof) in genderfluidity. However, they didn't publicly express this except in private discussions and once when stoned, followed by an apology. They also mention avoiding the group due to hostility. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, respecting others' identities is important, even if you don't agree. The author might be in the wrong if their disbelief is causing harm or disrespect to their friend's identity. However, the author says they respect their friends regardless of their beliefs. The problem arises if the author's actions (like the comment under the influence) were hurtful, but they did apologize. The friend's GF might have overreacted, but the author's avoidance could be seen as self-preservation rather than harmful action.\n\nBut if the author is not acting on their beliefs in a judgmental or harmful way, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, supporting someone's right to exist under their chosen identity is key. The author's disbelief might be problematic if it's leading to invalidating their friend's experience. So, there's a balance between holding personal views and respecting others' identities.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for holding their belief as long as they respect others and avoid harmful behavior. But if their disbelief translates into not respecting the friend's identity, that could be wrong. The context shows they apologize and distance themselves to avoid conflict, which might protect others' feelings. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but need to check all angles.\n"
