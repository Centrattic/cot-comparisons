Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not believing in genderfluidity and causing some conflict with their friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is left-leaning, atheist, doesn't oppose equal rights even if they disagree. They had a friend who is genderfluid, and the author doesn't believe in the concept. The friend's girlfriend accused the author of being an asshole, and the author says they only mentioned their disbelief once, while stoned, and apologized. Now they're being ridiculed for being an anti-SJW person.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I know, respecting someone's identity is generally considered important, regardless of personal beliefs. Even if someone doesn't believe in a certain identity, they should still respect the person's self-identification. The author admitted they don't believe in genderfluidity but claimed to respect their friend regardless. However, the friend's GF felt the author was being hostile, leading to the group avoiding each other.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014publicly expressing disbelief, even while stoned, and not changing their stance\u2014might have caused hurt feelings. Even though the author apologized, the fact that they don't support the concept could lead to ongoing tension. The key here is that while personal beliefs are valid, respecting others' identities is crucial. The author might be in the wrong because their lack of belief didn't translate into respecting the friend's identity, leading to conflict and exclusion. Also, the friend changing names multiple times and struggling with identity might be sensitive, and the author's comments could have been triggering.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they don't oppose equal rights and only expressed their disbelief once. But in the context of a group where sensitivity is high, that one comment might have been enough to cause lasting damage. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because respecting someone's identity goes beyond personal belief systems. So, answer A.\n"
