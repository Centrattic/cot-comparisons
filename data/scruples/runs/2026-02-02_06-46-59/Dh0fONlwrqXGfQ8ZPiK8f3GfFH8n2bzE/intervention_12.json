Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The author is a self-described left-leaning atheist who doesn't oppose equal rights but doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They had a conflict with a friend who is genderfluid, which led to some tension in their social group.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. Then, during a stoned conversation, they expressed their disbelief. The friend's partner called them out in a group message, implying they were being an asshole. The author apologized and affirmed respect but still faced jokes comparing them to anti-SJW people.\n\nThe key points here are the author's public expression of disbelief in genderfluidity, even under the influence, and the subsequent fallout. The main question is whether the author was wrong to express their personal beliefs, especially when it caused harm. The author claims they apologized and respect their friends' rights, but the act of expressing doubt in someone's identity can be hurtful. \n\nGender identity is a personal and sensitive issue. Even if someone doesn't believe in a concept, respecting others' self-identified gender is crucial for maintaining relationships and social harmony. The author's comment, even if made in a private discussion, led to their friend's partner feeling the need to call them out publicly. This suggests that the comment was indeed hurtful and inappropriate, especially given the context of the friend's recent self-identification as genderfluid.\n\nAdditionally, the author's avoidance of the group due to feeling hostility might stem from their own actions. The group's reaction (the partner's message and jokes) seems to be a direct response to the author's expressed disbelief. So, the author's actions likely contributed to the tension. \n\nIn terms of social norms, especially in modern, progressive circles, questioning someone's gender identity is generally considered disrespectful. The author's stance, while rooted in personal belief, doesn't account for the emotional impact on their friend. Respecting someone's identity doesn't require personal agreement but acknowledging their self-identity is key. \n\nThe author did apologize, which is a positive step, but the initial action of expressing disbelief in a context that caused harm makes them at fault. The fact that their friend is changing names and identities frequently might complicate things, but the author's role here is about respecting that self-identified journey rather than dismissing it. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because their actions, even if well-intentioned in the apology, caused hurt and contributed to a hostile environment. The answer should be A.\n"
