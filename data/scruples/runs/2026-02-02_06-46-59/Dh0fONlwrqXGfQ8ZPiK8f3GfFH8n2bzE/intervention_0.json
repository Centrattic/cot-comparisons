Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation, based on the Reddit post provided. The author is someone who identifies as being quite left-leaning and an atheist. They were part of a group of friends where one of the friends is in a long-distance relationship with an MTF (male-to-female) person and another who is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but usually keeps their thoughts to themselves. \n\nThe issue came up when the author was stoned and mentioned their disbelief in genderfluidity, which the friend's GF (girlfriend?) took issue with, and the friend changed their name multiple times and sometimes used their birth name. The author now feels hostile towards the group because they associate them with being over-sensitive and following a \"Tumblr\" ethos. They also mentioned they've been the target of jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author expressed their disbelief in genderfluidity when they were stoned, and then apologized. However, the friend's GF was upset enough to mention it directly. The author also says they don't oppose equal rights, just the concept itself. The friend in question is changing names and identities frequently, which the author sees as histrionic.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, respecting someone's identity, regardless of personal belief, is usually considered important. Even if someone doesn't agree with a person's identity, they're expected to respect it to avoid causing harm. The author's statement that they don't believe in genderfluidity is problematic, even if they apologized. Apologizing for expressing a belief that someone's identity is invalid might not be enough, especially if it's hurtful.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions avoiding the group due to hostility. However, if their initial statement led to the group's reaction, then the author might have contributed to the tension. The group might perceive the author's disbelief as invalidating their friend's identity, which can be hurtful and lead to the group being defensive or hostile.\n\nThe author also claims they're not against equal rights, but the distinction between personal belief and respecting someone's identity is crucial. Respecting someone's identity doesn't require agreeing with it, but it does require acknowledging their right to define themselves as they choose. The author's comment about genderfluidity being a concept they don't believe in could be seen as dismissing the validity of someone's lived experience.\n\nThe friend changing names multiple times and sometimes using their birth name might indicate that they are exploring their identity, which can be a part of the genderfluid experience. The author's view of this as histrionic could be a judgment that's not supportive.\n\nIn terms of the social dynamics, the author's group might be part of a community that prioritizes sensitivity and inclusion, which the author refers to as \"Tumblr ethos.\" The author's criticism of this might stem from discomfort with those values, but in such communities, respecting identities is a core value. The jokes comparing the author to anti-SJW types suggest that the author's stance is seen as opposing progressive values, even if they claim not to be against equal rights.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's statement about not believing in genderfluidity, despite being under the influence, and their subsequent avoidance of the group, might be seen as invalidating their friend's identity and contributing to social tension. Even if they apologized, the initial statement could have caused harm. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for expressing disbelief in someone's identity, which can be hurtful and counter to the values of respect and inclusion they profess to support.\n"
