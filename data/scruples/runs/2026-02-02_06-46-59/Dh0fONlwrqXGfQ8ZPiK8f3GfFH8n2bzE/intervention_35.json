Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity and some tension that followed.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. However, they made a comment while stoned, which the friend's partner called out. The friend changed names multiple times and there's confusion about their identity. The author feels the friend is histrionic and has avoided the group due to hostility. They apologized but are now being mocked for not being an \"SJW.\"\n\nSo, the key points are: the author expressed a belief that they don't support a friend's gender identity, even if they claim to respect others. The friend and their partner feel hurt, and the author is being compared to anti-SJW people. \n\nBut wait, the author says they respect their friends regardless of their personal beliefs. However, by not acknowledging the friend's gender identity, they're not respecting the friend's self-identification. Even if the author is left-leaning and supports equal rights, their personal disbelief in genderfluidity might not align with respecting the friend's declared identity. \n\nIn many communities, respecting someone's gender identity is seen as a basic form of respect, regardless of personal beliefs. The author's avoidance of the group and the initial comment, even if apologized for, could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience. \n\nThe partner's message asking for support and the subsequent actions of the author (avoiding the group, making comments) contribute to a hostile environment. The author's stance, even if they claim to respect others, might not be sufficient when it comes to a friend's self-identity. \n\nSo, the author's belief is their own, but how they express and act on that belief can hurt others. Not buying into genderfluidity might not be wrong in a personal belief sense, but refusing to acknowledge it to the friend's face and causing conflict might make the author the asshole here. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their friend's identity, leading to conflict and harm despite their personal beliefs.\n"
