Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is a self-proclaimed liberal, atheist, and someone who supports equal rights despite personal disagreements. The main issue is their stance on genderfluidity.\n\nThe author mentions they don't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keep it to themselves unless discussing. There's an incident where they were stoned, and a friend's GF (girlfriend?) accused them of being an asshole in a group message. The friend is in a relationship with someone transitioning from male to female, and the GF thinks he's just trying out being trans. The author believes the friend is being histrionic and has been avoiding the group because of the hostility towards them. The author apologized for any hurt and respects their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. Gender identity is a sensitive topic, especially in communities that emphasize social justice. The author's public skepticism, even if couched as personal belief, might be seen as dismissive or harmful, especially when their friend's partner is expressing concern. Even if the author apologized, the initial statement might have caused distress. The friend's partner's reaction (group message with the author's name in parentheses) indicates that the comment was impactful and possibly hurtful.\n\nThe author claims they only mentioned their disbelief once, in context, and under the influence. But the impact on the friend's partner and the resulting avoidance by the author could be seen as contributing to a toxic environment. The author's decision to avoid the group might be a coping mechanism but could also be perceived as them cutting ties or not supporting their friends, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author's intent might have been to express a personal belief, but the impact caused hurt and tension. In many social justice frameworks, the impact is given more weight. The author might be in the wrong because their skepticism was communicated in a way that caused harm to their friends, even if they later apologized. The fact that the group is described as following \"over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr\" suggests that the author might be in a community where such expressions are less tolerated, which adds to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer likely is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their public expression of disbelief, even if personal, caused hurt and conflict, and their subsequent avoidance might indicate a lack of effort to reconcile or support their friends despite their beliefs.\n"
