Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their Reddit post.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't believe in genderfluidity but usually keep it to themselves. They made a comment about it when they were stoned, which led to some backlash from their friend's girlfriend. The friend in question is genderfluid and has been changing names and identities, which the author thinks is histrionic. The author also mentions avoiding the group because of the hostility from the friend's girlfriend and being made fun of compared to anti-SJW people.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respecting others' identities and the context of the comment. The author did express their disbelief in genderfluidity in a group chat, even if it was under the influence. They also apologized later. However, the friend's GF took offense and spread the message, leading to the author feeling targeted. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not buying into the genderfluidity concept. Legally and socially, people have the right to hold their own beliefs, but when it comes to respecting others' identities, even if you don't agree, it's important to be respectful. The author's comment was in a group chat and might have been hurtful even if they apologized afterward. The fact that they avoided the group afterward could be seen as a reaction to the conflict, but the initial statement might have been the trigger.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, even if the author believes they are right in their views, expressing doubt about someone's gender identity in a public or semi-public space (like a group chat) can be harmful. The friend changing names multiple times and the author's perception of histrionics might not be valid judgments. The author's stance could be contributing to a hostile environment, even if they claim to respect the friends regardless.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for expressing disbelief in a way that caused hurt feelings, despite their apologies. The answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because their actions, while based on personal belief, were disrespectful in context.\n"
