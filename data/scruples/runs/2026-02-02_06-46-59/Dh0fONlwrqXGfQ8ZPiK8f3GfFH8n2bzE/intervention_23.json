Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not believing in their friend's genderfluid identity.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledges they're on the left and support equal rights but personally don't believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned, which led to some conflict. The friend's partner accused them of being an asshole and speculated the friend might be \"trying out\" being trans. The author mentions their friend is changing names and identities frequently, which they see as histrionic. They've distanced themselves from the group, feeling hostile towards their friends' approach, which they associate with Tumblr's sensitivity.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) The author doesn't believe in genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. 2) They admitted their disbelief once while stoned, apologized, and respected their friends despite it. 3) The friend's partner seems to have overreacted, making the author feel targeted. 4) The author feels attacked by comparisons to anti-SJW people.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Legally and socially, respecting someone's identity is crucial. However, the author isn't dismissing their friend's identity publicly; they just have personal doubts. They apologized and maintain respect. The problem might be their private opinions leading to distance, but they didn't force their views. However, the way they described the situation could imply a lack of support, which friends might need. The partner's overreaction and the group's hostility might also play a role in the conflict.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't forcing their beliefs, just struggling with personal acceptance. On the other, their actions (distance, not supporting) might be seen as harmful. But since they apologized and still respect their friends, maybe they're not the asshole. The partner's behavior and the group's environment could also be part of the issue. So, considering all, it's a complex situation where the author might not be entirely wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, the main question is if they're in the wrong. Since they didn't actively harm or deny rights, but had personal doubts, maybe the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides. But given the context, perhaps A is correct because not supporting someone's identity can be hurtful even if done privately. Hmm. Need to weigh the personal beliefs against social responsibility.\n"
