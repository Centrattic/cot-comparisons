Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. \n\nFirst, the author is a self-described left-leaning atheist who doesn't oppose equal rights even if they disagree with certain beliefs. They mention not buying into the concept of genderfluidity but usually keep it to themselves unless discussing. In this case, they were stoned and said they don't believe in it, which led to conflict with their friend's girlfriend who accused them of being an asshole.\n\nThe friend in question is genderfluid and has been changing their name and identity, but the author thinks they're being histrionic. The author avoided the group due to hostility and faced jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types. They apologized after the incident and affirm respect for their friends regardless of their beliefs.\n\nNow, considering the scenario, the main issue is whether the author's statement about not believing in genderfluidity, even if made in a private conversation while under the influence, is wrong. The key points are the context of the conversation, the apology, and the ongoing dynamics with the group. \n\nThe author did admit their mistake, apologized, and clarified they respect their friends. However, the act of expressing disbelief in someone's identity, even if not public, can be hurtful. The friend's GF took it as an attack, leading to group hostility. \n\nBut the author isn't refusing to support their friend's identity, just expressing a personal disbelief. They also state they respect their friends regardless. The problem might be more about the group's reaction and hypersensitivity rather than the author's stance. \n\nHowever, in many social contexts, especially with marginalized identities, stating disbelief can be seen as invalidating, even if done in private. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's identity, but they did apologize. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong if they're not attacking the person, just the concept. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they expressed disbelief in someone's identity, which can be hurtful, even if done privately. However, they did apologize, which shows they recognized the issue. But the situation involves the group's over-sensitivity and the author's avoidance leading to further conflict. \n\nHmm. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they expressed their opinion in a private context, apologized, and aren't attacking the person directly. The problem might be more on the friend's side for not accepting the apology or being too sensitive. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer could depend on cultural context and the specific dynamics. Since the author is in a group that's very sensitive, their statement might have been taken the wrong way despite their intentions. But the core issue is whether the statement itself is wrong. In many cases, respecting people's identities is expected, even if you don't agree with the concepts. So the author's belief in not accepting genderfluidity might be considered invalidating. Hence, they might be in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is about the act of not buying into the concept, not attacking the person. So if the author is just stating their disbelief without attacking the person's identity, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, in practice, expressing disbelief in someone's identity can still be harmful. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity, even privately, can be seen as dismissing their experience, especially when that identity is a core part of their self-conception. The author's statement, even if made under the influence and in a private context, contributed to the conflict and the friend's GF's feelings. The key is that the group reacted with hostility, which suggests that the author's words were hurtful and not respectful of their friend's identity. Even if they apologized, the initial statement was problematic. So the answer is A.\n"
