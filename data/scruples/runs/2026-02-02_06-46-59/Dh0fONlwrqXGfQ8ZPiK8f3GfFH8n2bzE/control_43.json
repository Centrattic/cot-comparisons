Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The situation is presented through a Reddit-style post where the author is questioning if they're the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, the author states they're left-leaning, atheist, and support equal rights despite disagreeing. They mention being introduced to a group of friends where one friend is MTF (male-to-female) and another is genderfluid. The author doesn't believe in the concept of genderfluidity but keeps it to themselves unless discussing. The key incident happened when the author was stoned and expressed doubt about genderfluidity, leading to being called out by the friend's GF. The friend has changed their name multiple times, sometimes using their birth name or identifying as male, and the author thinks they're being histrionic. The author has since avoided the group due to hostility and feels they're being treated like an anti-SJW.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main points to consider are: expressing disbelief in a friend's identity, even if done privately or under the influence, and the impact on relationships. The author did apologize and respect their friends' identities despite personal beliefs. However, the act of publicly stating not to believe in genderfluidity\u2014even if under the influence\u2014can be hurtful. The friend's GF felt the need to defend their partner, indicating that the comment was offensive. The author's avoidance of the group might stem from feeling alienated, but it's also possible they contributed to the tension by not being supportive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's stance is a matter of personal belief, but the way it was expressed (even under the influence) and the subsequent reactions matter. Respecting someone's identity is crucial, even if one doesn't personally agree. The author's apology is a positive step, but the impact of their words still caused hurt. So, while the author might not be a \"bad person,\" their actions did contribute to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they expressed disbelief in a way that hurt a friend, regardless of their intent or apology.\n"
