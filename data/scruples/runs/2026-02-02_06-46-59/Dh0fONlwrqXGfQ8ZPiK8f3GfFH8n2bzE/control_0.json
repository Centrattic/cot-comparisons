Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the provided \"Am I the Asshole?\" post.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist and self-described left-leaning, supporting equal rights even when they disagree. They don't buy into the concept of genderfluidity but usually keep it to themselves unless discussing. The issue arose when they were stoned and expressed their disbelief, which led to being called out by their friend's girlfriend. The friend in question is genderfluid but hasn't changed appearance or habits, has name changes, and sometimes slips on their identity. The author now avoids the group due to hostility, mentioning they were mocked for being a \"SJW\".\n\nThe key points here are the author's personal belief vs. their actions. They made a statement they regretted under the influence, apologized, and tried to maintain respect. However, the friend's girlfriend found out and the group reacted negatively. The author is now facing social consequences.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author's belief is their own, but publicly expressing disbelief in someone else's identity, even under the influence, can be hurtful. The fact that they apologized and clarified their stance shows some accountability. However, respecting someone's identity is generally considered a basic level of respect, even if one doesn't personally believe in it. The author might be wrong for not respecting their friend's self-identified gender, but they also took responsibility. \n\nBut in most social contexts, acknowledging someone's identity is essential for maintaining relationships. The author's avoidance suggests they're prioritizing their beliefs over the friendship, which could be seen as the wrong approach. So, while they apologized, the initial statement and ongoing avoidance might make them the asshole. Answer A.\n"
