Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author identifies as left-leaning and supportive of equal rights, but they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. They had a discussion while stoned where they expressed doubt, were called out by their friend's girlfriend, and now feel alienated. The author apologized but still feels targeted by jokes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's stance on genderfluidity is a personal belief, but they've made efforts to keep their opinions private unless in discussion. However, the context here is that they expressed their disbelief in a group chat when they were under the influence. The friend's girlfriend took offense and mentioned the author specifically, which led to tension. The author then avoids the group due to feeling hostility, but they also mention the group has a \"over-sensitivity\" attitude, similar to Tumblr, which might be contributing to the conflict.\n\nThe main issue here is whether expressing disbelief in someone's gender identity, even if done privately and under the influence, is wrong. The author apologizes and affirms respect, so they're not actively opposing their friend's identity. However, publicly stating disbelief (even if once) might be hurtful, especially in a context where the friend is transitioning or exploring their identity. The friend's girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment was damaging to their self-perception and the group dynamic.\n\nThe author's avoidance of the group could be seen as a defensive reaction rather than a direct offense. However, the initial statement might have contributed to a hostile environment. The key is whether the author's actions crossed the line into disrespect or harm. Since they acknowledged their friend's identity and made an apology, maybe it's more of a misunderstanding or insensitivity rather than malice. But in a close friend group, even one off comment can cause hurt, especially when it's about personal identity. So, the author might be in the wrong for making the statement, even if not maliciously. The answer would likely be A (Yes).\n"
