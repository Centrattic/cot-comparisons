Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author, who identifies as left-leaning and an atheist, doesn't believe in genderfluidity but usually keeps their opinions private. The main issue here is whether not buying into someone's gender identity makes the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author admitted they don't believe in genderfluidity but only expressed this once while stoned. They apologized and respect their friend regardless. The friend's partner accused them of being an asshole and speculated the friend was \"trying out being trans.\" The friend also has a history of changing names and gender identity, which the author finds histrionic. \n\nNow, the key points: The author is respecting the friend's identity in practice, even if they don't personally believe in genderfluidity. Their only public statement was under the influence, and they apologized. However, the friend's partner is using this to label them negatively, comparing them to anti-SJW individuals. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't actively harming the friend, just holds a differing belief. However, the act of not believing in someone's identity can be seen as invalidating, even if not expressed publicly. The partner's reaction might be protective, but the author's private disbelief doesn't necessarily make them wrong. But in today's context, even if you disagree, supporting someone's identity is often seen as necessary to avoid being harmful. The author avoids the group due to hostility, which suggests the environment is toxic, but the initial issue is the author's belief conflicting with the friend's identity. \n\nThe debate here is between personal belief and social acceptance. The author isn't forcing their views, but their disbelief might contribute to a lack of support. However, since they respect the friend regardless, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But invalidating someone's identity, even privately, can be hurtful. The answer might hinge on whether holding a personal belief without acting on it is acceptable. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong (B), but it's a close call.\n"
