Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not buying into a friend's genderfluid identity, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the post. The author identifies as very left-leaning and supports equal rights even when they disagree. They mention not believing in genderfluidity but keeping it to themselves unless discussing. The situation escalated when they were called out by the friend's GF in a group message, and later, the author avoided the group due to hostility from the friends who are part of a \"Tumblr\" culture that's oversensitive. The author claims they only once said they don't believe in genderfluidity, under the influence, and apologized, but still feels targeted with jokes comparing them to anti-SJW types.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my take. Let me think about the ethical and social implications here. \n\nGender identity is a personal and sensitive issue. While the author states they support equal rights, their public doubt about a friend's gender identity could be perceived as invalidating, even if they say they don't oppose it. Expressing disbelief in a friend's identity, especially in a group where others are more sensitive, can cause hurt feelings. The fact that the friend's partner felt the need to call out the author suggests that the author's comments were hurtful. \n\nThe author did apologize and affirm respect, but the act of publicly doubting someone's gender identity, even under the influence, might still be considered harmful. It's important to respect people's identities regardless of personal beliefs. The author's avoidance of the group due to hostility might be a consequence of their own actions. The group's reaction, while perhaps over-sensitive, isn't entirely without cause if the author's comments were indeed invalidating.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims they only expressed their disbelief once and in a specific context. However, in sensitive topics, even one instance can be damaging. The key issue here is about respecting others' identities and the impact of one's words, even if the author's intention wasn't malicious. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's disbelief and comments, despite their apology, likely contributed to the conflict. Supporting someone's rights and respecting their identity are different; the author may support rights but still fail to respect the identity, which is a form of being dismissive. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because they expressed doubt about a friend's gender identity, leading to hurt feelings and conflict, even if they later apologized. Respecting others' identities is a fundamental part of being supportive, regardless of personal beliefs.\n"
