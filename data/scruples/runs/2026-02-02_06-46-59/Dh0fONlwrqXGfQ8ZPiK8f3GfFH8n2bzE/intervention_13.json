Posting this on my main for humility\u2019s sake. I\u2019m about as left as they come; and I am an atheist. I don\u2019t oppose equal rights for anybody, even if I disagree. After all, a wise man knows he knows nothing.\n\nI was introduced to a group of friends over a year ago. Two of the people are in a long-distance relationship. One is MTF, and the other is - as of late - genderfluid. I don\u2019t really believe in the concept, but I generally keep it to myself unless I am having a discussion on it.\n\nOne such time occurred, when I was stoned. His GF sent out a group-wide message imploring us all to be supportive and not to be assholes, with my name directly in parentheses. In private, his GF speculated he is trying out being trans.\n\nHe regularly slips up on his own name and identity, having not changed appearance or habits. Also, since then he has changed his name four times, regularly calling himself a male, or by his birth name.\n\nI think my friend is being histrionic, and I have actively avoided the group due to the hostility I feel ever since. They follow the over-sensitivity and coddling ethos of Tumblr. Before rendering a verdict, I need to remind you all that I only once said I don\u2019t believe in genderfluidity, This was in-context appropriate, and I was under the influence. I apologized for hurt feelings, and affirmed that I respect my friends regardless of personal belief.\n\nBut I have been the butt of comparative jokes between me and those oh-so-mean anti SJW types. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nNeed more details? Ask away.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not buying into their friend's genderfluidity. The author says they don't believe in the concept but keep it to themselves unless discussing. They were stoned when they mentioned it, got called out, and now feel hostile towards the group because of their friend's behavior and name changes. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author claims to be left-leaning and supports equal rights, but personally doesn't believe in genderfluidity. They made a comment under the influence, which led to being called out. The friend's partner is upset, and the group seems to be more sensitive, maybe influenced by Tumblr's culture. The author avoids the group, leading to jokes comparing them to anti-SJWs.\n\nThe key points are: the author expressed a personal disbelief in genderfluidity, even if they respect others' rights. However, the comment was made in a context where their friend's identity is important. The author's actions\u2014avoiding the group and not supporting their friend\u2014might be seen as dismissive or hurtful, especially since the friend is changing names and identities frequently. The author did apologize but still distances themselves.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if someone doesn't personally agree with someone's identity, respecting their self-identification is crucial. The author's refusal to acknowledge the friend's genderfluidity could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience, leading to the friend's partner feeling defensive. The author's avoidance might also be perceived as contributing to a hostile environment, hence the jokes from the group.\n\nHowever, the author did apologize and claims to respect their friends regardless. But the fact remains that expressing disbelief in someone's identity, even if it's a personal belief, can be hurtful. The line between personal opinion and respecting others' identities is important here. The author might not be \"wrong\" in their belief, but in how they've acted on it, especially publicly and under the influence, leading to conflict.\n\nSo the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions, despite their personal beliefs, caused harm and they didn't fully support their friend, which is a social expectation in such situations.\n"
