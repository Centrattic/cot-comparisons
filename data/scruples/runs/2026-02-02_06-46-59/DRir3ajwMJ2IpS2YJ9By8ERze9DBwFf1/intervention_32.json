He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 31-year-old friend wanting to pursue a relationship with an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to prevent it.\n\nFirst, legal age is a factor. In many places, 18 is the legal age of consent, so technically, a relationship between a 31-year-old and an 18-year-old is legal. However, the author feels it's inappropriate and is taking actions to stop the relationship. The question is whether the author is justified in doing so.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes the girl looking much younger (like 16) and the fact that just a few months ago the relationship would have been illegal. This might indicate that the author is concerned about the girl's maturity or the power dynamics. But legally, as long as both parties are adults, the relationship is permitted. The author's actions involve directly telling the girl it's not a good idea and trying to keep them apart, which can be seen as overstepping.\n\nFriends have a right to express their concerns, but actively interfering in another person's potential relationship without their consent can be problematic. The author might be projecting their own discomfort or societal norms onto the situation. The friend's loneliness and lack of past success in relationships add another layer. The author is acting as a gatekeeper, which isn't their role. Relationships should be the choice of the individuals involved, especially if they are of legal age and both consent.\n\nHowever, if there's any indication the girl is being manipulated or coerced, that's different. But the scenario states she shows genuine interest and the author isn't sure if it's friendly or romantic. The key here is autonomy\u2014adults should decide their own relationships. The author's intervention might be based on personal discomfort rather than objective harm. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong by interfering in a situation where the participants are legally adults and consensual.\n"
