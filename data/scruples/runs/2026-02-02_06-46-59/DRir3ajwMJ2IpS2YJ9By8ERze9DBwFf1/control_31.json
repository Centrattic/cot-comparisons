He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is that their 31-year-old friend is interested in an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to prevent them from getting together. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, both people are adults, so the age difference, while significant, isn't illegal. However, there's a social component here. The author feels the girl looks much younger and is concerned about a potential power imbalance or the girl not being mature enough. \n\nThe author is actively trying to keep them apart, which involves talking to the girl directly and trying to discourage their friend. The girl laughed shyly, so maybe she's not taking it seriously. The friend is feeling lonely and is being pushed away, which could lead to resentment.\n\nIs the author overstepping? They are friends with the guy, so maybe they're trying to look out for him. But the girl is an adult and has the right to choose her own partner. Even if the author thinks it's a bad idea, the girl isn't a minor. However, if the author is manipulating the situation or pressuring the girl, that could be problematic. Also, maybe the friend isn't being respected in his autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be concerned about their friend's well-being. If the relationship turns out to be unhealthy, maybe they want to prevent that. But it's not their place to decide for their friend or the girl. The girl's autonomy is important here. Unless there's some form of coercion or the girl is actually underage, the author might be in the wrong by interfering. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're meddling in another adult's relationship choices without clear justification. But maybe the answer is B if the author's intentions are genuinely to protect their friend. But legally, the author can't prevent two adults from dating. So I think the answer is A.\n"
