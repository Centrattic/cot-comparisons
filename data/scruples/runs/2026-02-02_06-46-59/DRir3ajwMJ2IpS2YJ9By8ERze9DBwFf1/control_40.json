He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is lonely and hasn't had success with women, and the girl is technically an adult but looks younger. The author and another friend are actively trying to keep them apart, even talking to the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, 18 is the legal age of consent, so the relationship isn't illegal. However, there might be jurisdiction-specific laws where the age difference could matter, but the question doesn't specify that. So legally, they can date if both consent.\n\nEthically, it's trickier. The author is worried about the girl's maturity, thinking she looks younger. But age isn't the only factor in maturity. The girl might be more mature than she appears. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping\u2014assuming they know what's best for their friend and the girl without consulting them directly. \n\nThe friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author's intervention might be based on their own discomfort rather than the girl's well-being. By not giving the girl the chance to decide for herself, the author could be undermining her autonomy. Also, the approach of trying to prevent the relationship without clear evidence of harm could damage trust with both friends.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern comes from a place of caring about their friend's well-being, thinking he might be unprepared for a relationship with a much younger person. But it's possible the friend is capable of handling it. The key point is that both individuals are adults and have the right to choose their partners, even if others disapprove.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely overstepping by trying to control the situation without valid reasons. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they shouldn't interfere in the adults' decisions unless there's actual harm involved.\n"
