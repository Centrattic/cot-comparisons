He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, so there's a 13-year age gap. Both are adults, but the author feels she looks younger, maybe 16, and is concerned about the age difference.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is a key point. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship is legally allowed. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, but now it's okay. So legally, there's no issue. That's a major point against the author's justification.\n\nNext, the author's actions: they told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea directly, and they're trying to prevent the relationship. They're using friendship to intervene. The question is whether this oversteps. Friends can offer advice, but actively trying to stop two adults from dating can be seen as meddlesome. The girl is an adult too, so her autonomy matters. The author might not have the right to dictate her choices.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is unclear. Are they genuinely concerned about their friend's well-being, or are there other factors, like personal discomfort with age gaps? The post mentions the author finds the thought \"creepy,\" which could be their own bias influencing their actions. It's possible they're projecting their own discomfort onto the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's loneliness. The friend is struggling with past relationship issues, and the author is trying to protect him, but maybe they're not considering that the friend is an adult capable of making his own decisions. The author's actions might be controlling and undermine the friend's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the girl's perspective is important. If she's 18 and interested in the older man, it's her choice. The author's direct approach to her without considering her wishes could be disrespectful. The girl's response was shy laughter, which might indicate she's not fully supportive of the idea, but the author didn't take that as a sign to stop.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have concerns, the legal aspect is clear, and the actions taken (like trying to prevent the relationship) could be seen as overreaching. The author is not the one in a position to make decisions for either party. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
