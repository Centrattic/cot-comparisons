He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author thinks she's too young and is actively trying to stop them, even talking to her directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship isn't illegal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying maybe the girl was underage then. But now she's 18, so legally it's okay. That's a key point.\n\nNext, personal boundaries. The author is stepping in as a friend, but the friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. Even if the author is concerned, they don't have the right to control another adult's romantic choices. The girl is also an adult, so she's making her own decisions too. The author's actions might be overstepping, especially talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart.\n\nThe author's motivations are important. They say the friend hasn't had luck with girls and is lonely. But that doesn't justify interfering. Friends can offer advice, but not manipulate situations to prevent relationships. The author's actions might be rooted in genuine concern but expressed in a way that's controlling.\n\nAlso, the author is assuming the girl's interest is just friendly or not serious. They can't know that for sure. The girl might be interested in a relationship, and the author is making judgment calls without knowing her perspective.\n\nEthically, each person has the right to choose their partners as long as they're consenting adults. The author's intervention might harm the friendship and could be seen as disrespectful to both the friend and the girl. The friend might feel betrayed, and the girl might feel pressured or harassed if the author is actively trying to keep them apart.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is acting beyond their role as a friend by trying to control another adult's romantic decisions. Even if their intentions are good, the methods are inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
