He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. \n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that the girl was underage before, but now she's 18. So the legal age of consent is likely 18 in this context.\n\nThe author's main concern is the age difference. They think she looks younger, maybe 16, and the age gap seems significant. They feel the girl is too young, even though legally she's an adult. The author is trying to prevent the relationship by talking to both the girl and the friend, even considering other ways to keep them apart.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consent, personal choice, and the role of friends. The author is stepping into a role of making decisions for their friend regarding a romantic relationship. Even though their intentions might be good\u2014concerned about their friend's past loneliness and potential for a healthy relationship\u2014it's the friend's autonomy to decide. The author is interfering without the friend's consent, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the girl is an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The author's direct approach, like telling the girl not to date the friend, might be dismissive of her agency. The fact that the girl responded with shyness but didn't take offense might indicate she's not interested or just polite, but the author's interference isn't her choice to make.\n\nIn terms of the ethical angle, friends have a right to express their concerns, but actively trying to prevent a relationship goes beyond that. It's possible the author is projecting their own discomfort with the age difference rather than the friend's actual well-being. The friend is free to choose who he dates, as long as both parties consent. The author's actions could be seen as controlling and undermining the friend's autonomy.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering with the friend's personal choice in a legally permissible relationship without respecting the friend's autonomy.\n"
