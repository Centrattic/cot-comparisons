He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 31-year-old friend wanting to date an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so legally, the relationship would be allowed. However, the author is concerned about the age difference, thinking the girl looks younger and that the age gap is too big. But legally, as long as both are adults, it's okay.\n\nNext, the author is intervening by talking to the girl and trying to stop them from getting together. The question is whether this is the author's place to do. Friends might step in if they think someone is being taken advantage of, but here, the girl seems to show genuine interest. The author's motives could be protective, but it's also possible they are projecting their own discomfort or societal norms about age gaps.\n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. Both individuals are adults and have the right to choose their partners. The author might be overstepping by trying to influence the girl directly, especially if the relationship is consensual. However, if the author believes the girl is being manipulated or not in a good position to make a choice, that's different. But the scenario doesn't mention any signs of coercion or harm.\n\nThe friend's loneliness and past issues with relationships might be making him desperate, but that's his personal journey. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting the friend's autonomy. However, the author could argue they're looking out for their friend's best interest.\n\nSo, the key points are consent, legality, autonomy, and the author's right to intervene. Since both are adults and it's legal, the author might be infringing on their friend's choices. Unless there's clear evidence of harm or manipulation, the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent a consensual relationship between two adults.\n"
