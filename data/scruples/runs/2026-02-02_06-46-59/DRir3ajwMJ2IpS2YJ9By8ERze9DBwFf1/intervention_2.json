He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 31-year-old friend who wants to date an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop them, along with another friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legal. But the author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, meaning the girl might have been under 18. However, now she's 18. So legally, there's no issue here. But the author feels morally uncomfortable.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the relationship's appropriateness. The age difference is 13 years, which is significant. The author thinks the girl looks 16, which might be a concern if she's perceived as underage. But since she's 18, legally, that's not a factor. However, societal views might differ. Some people might see a 13-year gap as a problem, especially if the younger person is seen as less mature.\n\nThe author is interfering by talking to both friends and trying to keep them apart. They've even told the girl it's a bad idea, and she laughed it off. The friend wants to date her despite the encouragement to find someone his own age. The author's actions might be well-intentioned, thinking they're protecting their friend from a potentially problematic relationship. But are they overstepping?\n\nIn terms of personal freedom, adults can choose their partners as long as it's consensual and legal. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto their friend. The question is whether the author has the right to interfere in their friend's personal choices, even if they disagree with them. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author and their friend are actively trying to prevent the relationship could be seen as controlling. Unless there's evidence of harm or non-consent, which isn't mentioned here, the author might be violating their friend's autonomy. The girl is an adult, so even if the author thinks she's too young, it's her choice to engage in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motives. They might be trying to help by steering their friend towards more age-appropriate relationships, but doing so by interfering in a consensual adult relationship could be wrong. The friend is clearly interested, and the girl shows some interest. The author's actions could be causing more harm by undermining their friend's agency.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is trying to prevent a legal and consensual relationship between two adults. While their intentions might be to protect their friend, they're overstepping by controlling the situation and not respecting their friend's autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
