He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is feeling lonely and has had trouble with relationships, and the author, along with another friend, is actively trying to keep them apart. The girl is described as being a bit young-looking, and the author is concerned because it was illegal for the friend to pursue her a couple of months ago, implying maybe she's a minor now. But the girl is 18, which is an adult in most places.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal age of consent. In many jurisdictions, including most of the US and Europe, 18 is the age of majority and the legal age of consent. So if she's 18, it's legal for them to date. The author's argument that \"a couple of months ago it would be illegal\" might be if the girl was under 18 before, but now she's 18, so that's no longer the case. If the girl is truly 18, then the author's legal concern is moot.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is making a judgment based on their own discomfort and perception of the girl's age. They haven't consulted the girl's own feelings or agency. The girl might be mature for her age, and if she's genuinely interested, it's her choice. The author is interfering in their friend's romantic life without the friend's consent, which could be seen as overstepping, even if their intentions are good. The friend is an adult and has the right to choose their partners, even if they are younger than what the author considers appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is partly based on their friend's past loneliness and lack of success with women. They might be trying to protect their friend from potential heartbreak, but that's not their place. The friend is an adult and should be allowed to make his own decisions, even if they're risky. The author could instead be encouraging their friend to build confidence and approach the girl respectfully, rather than trying to prevent the relationship altogether.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their friend's well-being. They might think the relationship could be exploitative due to the age gap. However, unless there's a power imbalance (like if the girl is a student or in a subordinate position), an age gap between two consenting adults isn't inherently problematic. The author's actions could be seen as controlling both their friend and the girl, which is not appropriate.\n\nSo the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong, because they are interfering in a legal and consensual relationship based on their own biases and without respecting the autonomy of the individuals involved.\n"
