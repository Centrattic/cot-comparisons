He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18, which is legal in many places, but the author feels it's inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16-18, so 18 is legally an adult. So, legally, the relationship is allowed. But the author is uncomfortable because the girl looks younger and the age difference feels significant. But age gaps aren't illegal here, so maybe the author is overstepping.\n\nThen, the author is actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to the girl and another friend. They told the girl directly it wouldn't be a good idea, but she laughed it off. The friend is lonely and the author is discouraging him. But does the author have the right to interfere like that?\n\nThe key points here are consent, legality, and personal boundaries. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or interfering in someone else's personal choices, even if their intentions are to protect. However, the author might argue they're looking out for their friend's well-being, given the friend's history of bad experiences.\n\nBut the author isn't the one in the relationship. They can't know the girl's true intentions or the nature of their interactions. Also, the friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author's actions might be crossing a line into manipulation or bullying, especially if they're coordinating with another friend to keep them apart.\n\nSo, even though the author has concerns, they don't have the authority to make decisions for their friend or the girl. The right answer here is likely that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal and consensual relationship without proper justification.\n"
