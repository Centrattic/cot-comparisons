He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the U.S., the age of consent varies by state, but it's generally 16 or 18. Since the girl is 18, even if she looks younger, it's legally allowed. So the author's concern about it being illegal might not hold up. But maybe the author is in a place where the age of consent is different? Not sure, but assuming it's 18, then technically it's okay.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The age difference is 13 years. Some people might see that as a big gap, but others don't. The key here is that both are adults. The author is trying to interfere because they think the girl is too young and \"might as well be 16,\" but she's legally an adult. The author's actions, like talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart, could be seen as overstepping. The friends might have good intentions, but they aren't the ones involved in the relationship. It's not their place to decide who their friend dates, as long as it's legal and consensual.\n\nAlso, the author's friend is feeling lonely and the author is discouraging him from pursuing a potential relationship. That could be seen as controlling or not respecting their friend's autonomy. The author might be projecting their own concerns about their friend's social life onto the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be worried about their friend's emotional well-being or the girl being taken advantage of. But since the girl shows genuine interest and is an adult, maybe the author's concerns are unfounded. The author isn't providing evidence that the girl is being manipulated or that the relationship is unhealthy. It's possible the author is just uncomfortable with the age gap and is acting on personal bias.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the right because they are interfering in their friend's personal life without just cause. Unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, adults should be allowed to date each other. The author's actions might come off as judgmental and controlling.\n"
