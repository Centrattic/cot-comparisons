He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is around 16 or 18, so 18 is legally an adult. Both individuals are adults, so legally, there's no issue. But the author feels morally uncomfortable, thinking she looks younger. But looks can be deceiving; legally, age is based on actual age, not appearance.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. They mention their friend has had trouble with relationships and is lonely. The author and another friend are trying to intervene. The author directly told the girl it's not a good idea, and she laughed shyly. The friend is being discouraged but is still interested. \n\nI need to think about personal autonomy. The author is a friend but not a parent or guardian. The decision to date someone is up to the individuals involved, provided both are adults. The author might have good intentions, but they're infringing on their friend's choice. Even if the author thinks the girl is too young, unless there's a power imbalance or coercion, it's their right to choose. \n\nAlso, the author's approach\u2014trying to keep them apart\u2014could be seen as manipulative. The friend might appreciate the concern, but ultimately, he should decide his own relationships. The girl is an adult too, so she can make her own decisions. The author's actions could be overstepping, even if they come from a place of worry.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they're meddling in their friend's personal life without justification. Unless there's actual harm or non-consensual elements, the author shouldn't dictate who their friend can date. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). Wait, but some might argue that the girl is very young and maybe not mature enough. However, legally and ethically, unless there's evidence of immaturity affecting consent, it's still their choice. So, the answer is A.\n"
