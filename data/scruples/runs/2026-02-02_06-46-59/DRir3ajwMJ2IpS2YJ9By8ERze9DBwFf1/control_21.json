He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, a 31-year-old and an 18-year-old can consent to a relationship. However, the author mentions that the girl looks 16 and just a few months ago it would have been illegal. That part is confusing because if she's 18 now, even if she looks younger, the legality is there. Maybe the author is concerned about the girl's maturity rather than the legal age.\n\nNext, the author's intentions. They're trying to protect their friend from what they see as an inappropriate relationship. The friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with girls before. The author and another friend are actively trying to keep them apart, including telling the girl it's not a good idea. The girl responded with a shy laugh, not taking it seriously.\n\nEthically, this is a gray area. While the author might be acting out of concern, they're interfering in their friend's personal choices. The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions, even if the author disagrees. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if the friend isn't forced but is being influenced against his will.\n\nAlso, the author's judgment about the girl's age and maturity could be biased. They assume the girl isn't a good match just because she's younger, even though she's 18. The relationship being consensual between two adults is a key point here. The author might not be considering that the girl might be ready for such a relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the author's role as a friend. While friends can express their concerns, actively trying to sabotage or prevent another adult from entering a consensual relationship could be crossing a line. The friend's autonomy should be respected unless there's evidence of harm or coercion, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, their actions in interfering with their friend's personal life without clear justification (like the girl being underage or in a vulnerable situation) could make them wrong. The key factors are the legal age, consent, and the right to personal choice.\n"
