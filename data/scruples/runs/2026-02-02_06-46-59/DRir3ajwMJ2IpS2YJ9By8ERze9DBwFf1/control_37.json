He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. The main points here are the age difference and the intentions behind the author's actions.\n\nFirst, both individuals are adults, so legally, there's no issue. The age of consent varies by location, but since the girl is 18, it's likely legal. The author is concerned about the girl's maturity, thinking she looks younger. However, that's subjective and not a legal factor. The author has spoken to both parties, trying to discourage the relationship. But the friend is feeling lonely and the girl isn't clearly against it.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is autonomy. The friend is an adult who can make his own decisions, even if others disagree. The author's actions involve trying to prevent a consensual relationship between two adults. Even if the author's intentions are good, they're interfering with someone else's choice. Unless there's abuse or coercion, which isn't mentioned, the author might be overstepping by trying to control their friend's relationships. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering in a consensual adult relationship without justification.\n"
