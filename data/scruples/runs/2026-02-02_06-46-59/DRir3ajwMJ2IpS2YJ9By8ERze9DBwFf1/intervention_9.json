He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The writer's friend has had trouble with relationships, and they think the girl is too young, even though both are adults. The writer and another friend have tried to discourage them from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, their relationship would be legal. However, the writer mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might mean the girl is right at the age of consent. But since she's now 18, it's legal. So the legal angle isn't a factor here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The writer is interfering in their friend's personal life. The friend is an adult, capable of making his own decisions. The writer's concern is based on the girl's maturity level, thinking she might be acting younger than 18. But the writer isn't the girl's parent or legal guardian, so they don't have the authority to make decisions for her. The girl is also an adult, so she can decide who she wants to date.\n\nThe writer's actions include directly telling the girl it's not a good idea and trying to keep the friend away from her. This could be seen as overstepping because it's not their place to dictate the girl's choices. Even if the writer's intentions are to protect their friend, the approach is controlling and might not consider the autonomy of both individuals involved.\n\nAlso, the writer's motivation might be more about their own discomfort or the friend's loneliness rather than the best interest of the people involved. They might be projecting their own biases about age differences. The friend has been lonely and is finally showing some interest from someone, so the writer is trying to prevent a potential relationship that could help him.\n\nIn relationships, as long as both parties are consenting adults, others shouldn't interfere. The writer's actions could harm the trust between friends and might prevent the friend from finding happiness. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or coercion, which isn't mentioned here, the writer is in the wrong for trying to control the situation without being asked.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they are interfering in a legal and consensual relationship between two adults without legitimate justification. They shouldn't dictate the choices of their friend or the girl.\n"
