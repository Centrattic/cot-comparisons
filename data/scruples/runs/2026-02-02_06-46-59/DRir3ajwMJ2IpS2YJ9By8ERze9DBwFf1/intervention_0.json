He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The author's friend has never had much luck with women, and now he's interested in this girl who's just turned 18. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, the relationship isn't illegal. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would be illegal, implying that maybe the girl was underage at the time, but now she's 18. So legally, there's no problem. But the author finds it creepy because the girl looks younger than her age. That's a personal feeling, though, not a legal issue.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author is interfering in their friend's personal life. The friend is an adult, so he has the right to choose his own partners as long as they're adults too. The author is taking it upon themselves to stop this, possibly without the friend's consent. That could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author's intentions are good\u2014to protect their friend from a potentially problematic relationship\u2014they're not the ones in the relationship. The friend might have his reasons for being interested in her, and the girl is also an adult who can make her own decisions.\n\nThe author is even talking to the girl directly and discouraging her, which might be a bigger issue. That's not just advising their friend but intervening in the girl's choices. The girl laughed shyly, so maybe she's not entirely against the idea, but the author is imposing their opinion on her. That's a violation of her autonomy.\n\nAnother point is the age difference. A 31 and an 18-year-old have a 13-year gap. While both are adults, that's a significant difference. Some people might find that concerning because of the potential power imbalance, especially if one is more mature or experienced. However, others might argue that as long as both are willing and consenting, it's their choice.\n\nThe author's motivation is important here. They're trying to help their friend who's been lonely and had bad experiences. But the way they're handling it\u2014by actively trying to keep the two apart\u2014could be seen as manipulation. The friend is an adult and should be making his own decisions, even if those decisions aren't what the author wants.\n\nAlso, considering the girl's age, even if she's 18, if she looks much younger, there might be societal judgments. But again, that's subjective. The author's discomfort doesn't justify interfering unless there's actual harm or danger.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author is meddling in their friend's and the girl's lives without their consent, even though there's no legal barrier. They're acting on their own judgment rather than respecting the autonomy of both individuals. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
