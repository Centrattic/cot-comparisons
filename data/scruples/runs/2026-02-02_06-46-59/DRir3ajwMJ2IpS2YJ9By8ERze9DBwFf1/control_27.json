He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legally okay. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which might be because the girl was under 18 before. Now that she's 18, it's legal. But the author still feels it's a bad idea.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the girl looks younger, maybe like 16, and the age difference feels significant. They think the girl is too young for the 31-year-old friend. The author and another friend are actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to the girl and discouraging the friend. The author's friend is feeling lonely and hasn't had much luck with relationships.\n\nNow, the ethical part. Even though it's legal, age differences can be socially controversial. The author is acting out of concern, possibly seeing the girl as immature or not a good match. However, they are interfering in the friend's personal choices. The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions, even if others disagree.\n\nAnother angle: the author is imposing their own values on their friend. The friend might see the girl as a genuine match, and the author's actions could be seen as controlling or overstepping. The girl is also an adult, so if she's interested, it's her choice too.\n\nBut there's also the potential power imbalance. A 31-year-old and an 18-year-old might have different life experiences, maturity levels. The author might be worried about the girl being taken advantage of, but since she's 18 and the author said she's showing genuine interest, maybe she's capable of making her own decisions.\n\nSo, the author's actions are about preventing a relationship they believe is inappropriate. But is it their place to do so? The friend is an adult, so the author might be overstepping by trying to control who he dates. Unless there's clear harm or coercion, adults should be able to choose their partners. The author's motivation is concern, but crossing into active interference could be problematic.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in their friend's personal life without a valid justification beyond their personal discomfort.\n"
