He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The writer's friend is 31 and the girl is 18, and they're both adults. The author is concerned that the girl looks younger and that the age gap feels too big, even though legally it's allowed. The author has tried to discourage both the friend and the girl, even going as far as to tell the girl it's a bad idea and trying to keep them apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is overstepping by interfering in their friend's personal decisions. The 31-year-old is an adult, so he has the right to choose his own relationships. The author is acting out of concern, but does that justify their actions? Also, the girl is 18, which is the legal age of consent in many places, so the relationship isn't illegal. The author's argument is more about the perceived age difference and maturity level, but that's subjective. \n\nAnother point is whether the author has the right to make decisions for both their friend and the girl. They've directly told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea, which could be seen as controlling. The friend is also an adult and should be able to make his own choices, even if the author disagrees. The author's actions might be infringing on their friend's autonomy. \n\nHowever, the author might argue they're looking out for their friend's best interest, especially since he's been lonely and might not realize the potential issues. But even well-intentioned interference can be problematic. The line between helping and overstepping is blurry here. \n\nI think the key factors are: the legal age, the adults' right to choose their partners, and the author's role in their lives. Since both parties are adults, the author's attempts to prevent the relationship could be seen as unnecessary and disrespectful. Unless there's clear harm or manipulation involved, the author shouldn't decide for them. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal, adult relationship without justification.\n"
