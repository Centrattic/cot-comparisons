He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend is 31 and has had trouble with relationships. He's been feeling down and complained a lot. Now he's getting to know an 18-year-old girl. They're friends, but he wants more. The writer thinks the girl is too young, even though she's an adult. The writer and another friend are trying to stop them from dating. The writer told the girl it's not a good idea, and she laughed shyly. They're also trying to keep the friend away from her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the legal age of consent. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship would be legal. The writer is concerned about the age difference, but since both are adults, it's a personal choice. The writer is a friend, but trying to prevent the relationship might be overstepping. The friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to make his own decisions, even if others disagree. The writer's intentions might be to protect, but the actions could be controlling. Also, the girl is 18, so she's of legal age to make her own choices. The writer's actions could be seen as interfering in a consensual relationship between two adults. \n\nHowever, maybe the writer is worried about the friend's inexperience or the power dynamic. But again, if both parties are consenting adults, it's not the writer's place to stop them. The writer might be projecting their own feelings about age differences or have a personal discomfort. The answer here would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're interfering in a legal, consensual relationship between two adults. The friends should respect each other's autonomy even if they disagree.\n"
