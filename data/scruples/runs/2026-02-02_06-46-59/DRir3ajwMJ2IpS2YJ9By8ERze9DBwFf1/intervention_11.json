He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18 but looks younger. The author feels she's too young and is trying to stop them from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider age of consent laws. In most places, 18 is the legal age, so technically, it's legal. But the author is concerned because she looks younger, which might make them feel it's a power imbalance. However, the girl is an adult, so legally, there's no issue. \n\nThen, the author's motivation. They say the friend has been lonely and had trouble with relationships. The author might be acting out of concern, thinking they know what's best for their friend. But does that give them the right to interfere? It depends on consent and autonomy. The friend is an adult, so his decisions about relationships are his own. The author isn't a parent or authority figure; they're a friend. \n\nAlso, the author is making assumptions about the girl's intentions. They mention the girl shows interest but can't tell if it's friendly or romantic. The author is projecting their own discomfort onto the situation. They might be overstepping by not respecting their friend's choice, even if they disagree with it.\n\nAnother angle: the author is manipulating the situation by trying to keep them apart. If the friend is an adult, he should be allowed to make his own decisions, even if others think it's unwise. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or violating their friend's autonomy.\n\nBut maybe there's a power dynamic. A 31-year-old and an 18-year-old could have a significant age gap, which might affect the relationship's balance. However, as long as both parties are consenting adults, it's their choice. The author's role is to express their concerns but not to actively prevent the relationship.\n\nIn summary, the author is a friend who is overstepping by trying to control their friend's romantic choices. The friend is an adult and should have the right to pursue a relationship with someone of legal age, even if others find it unideal. The author's actions might stem from good intentions, but they're not the one to make that decision for their friend. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
