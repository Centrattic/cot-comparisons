He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author feels she's too young and they look 16, so it's a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it's legal. But the author is worried she looks younger, which might be a concern. But legally, as long as she's 18, it's okay. So the author's legal argument isn't valid.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is interfering in their friend's personal life. Even if they think it's for the friend's good, they have no right to control their decisions. The friend is an adult and can make his own choices. The author might have good intentions, but it's not their place to stop him. Also, the girl is an adult, so she can decide for herself. The author's actions, like talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart, could be seen as overstepping. They might be violating the girl's autonomy and their friend's right to choose.\n\nAnother point is the author's own biases. They mention the girl \"might as well be 16,\" but that's a subjective judgment. Physical appearance doesn't define someone's maturity. The author's discomfort with the age difference might be based on personal preferences, not objective reasons.\n\nThe friend has been lonely and is looking for companionship. The author is trying to prevent a potential relationship that could be meaningful to him. That could be unfair. Even if the relationship doesn't work out, the friend should have the right to pursue it.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be to protect their friend, they are overstepping by making decisions for him and the girl. The friend and the girl are both adults and capable of making their own choices, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
