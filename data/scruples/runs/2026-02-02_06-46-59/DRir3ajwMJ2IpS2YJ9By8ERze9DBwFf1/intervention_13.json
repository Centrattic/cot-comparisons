He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author's friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The key points here are about age differences, legal aspects, and personal boundaries.\n\nFirst, both individuals are legally adults. The age of consent varies by jurisdiction, but in many places, 18 is the legal age. So, if the girl is 18, there's no legal barrier here. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, implying that maybe the girl is close to 18, but now she's reached that age. That's a red herring because once she's 18, it's legally permissible. The author's discomfort might stem from feeling the girl is younger in appearance, but that's subjective.\n\nNext, the author is intervening by talking to the girl and trying to prevent the relationship. Friends can offer advice, but taking active steps to stop someone from forming a relationship, especially without the girl's consent, could be seen as overstepping. The girl seems to be showing interest, even if it's not clear if it's romantic. The author's actions might be infringing on their friend's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the friend's loneliness and past experiences are mentioned. The author is trying to help by finding other ways to keep them apart. However, unless there's evidence of harm or exploitation, which isn't indicated here, the author's actions might be based on personal discomfort rather than objective reasons. The 31-18 age gap can be significant in terms of life experience, but as long as both parties are consenting adults, it's their choice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the intervention is justified. Since the legal age is met, and assuming both parties are willing, the author's interference without a valid reason (like abuse or coercion) could be considered inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for trying to control their friend's personal choices without sufficient justification.\n"
