He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author and another friend are trying to stop them from getting together, even though they're both legally adults.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl is 18, then it's legally okay. So the author's argument about it being illegal a few months ago might not hold if the girl is now 18. The key is that both parties are adults. \n\nNext, the author's reasoning is that the girl looks younger, maybe like 16. But appearance doesn't determine legal age. The author is worried about the age gap, even though both are adults. That could be a personal opinion rather than a legal issue. The question is whether the author has the right to interfere in their friend's romantic choices. \n\nThen, there's the ethical side. The author is intervening to prevent a relationship, even though both parties are consenting adults. The friends might be acting out of concern, but does that justify their actions? It's possible that the author is overstepping by not allowing the friend to make his own choices. \n\nThe girl seems to show some interest, though it's unclear if it's romantic. The author directly told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea, which could be manipulative. The friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships before. The author's actions might be well-intentioned but could infringe on their autonomy. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to choose their partners as long as both are adults. Unless there's evidence of coercion or harm, the author's intervention might be unwarranted. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're interfering without valid legal or ethical grounds.\n"
