He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent his 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, legal aspect: In many places, the legal age of consent is 18. So technically, there's no legal issue here. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, but now it's legal. So legally, the friend isn't doing anything wrong.\n\nThen there's the age difference. 18 is the legal age, but society often looks at a 13-year gap as a big deal. However, since both are adults, it's their choice. The author is concerned about the girl's maturity, thinking she looks 16. But appearance doesn't determine maturity. The girl is 18, so she's legally an adult, and her maturity level is her own.\n\nThe author is intervening by telling the girl it's a bad idea and trying to keep them apart. This could be seen as overstepping. The friend has the right to make his own romantic choices. The author might be projecting his own discomfort or societal norms onto others.\n\nAlso, the friend is lonely and seeking companionship. The author's actions could be harmful, preventing a potential relationship without valid reasons. Unless there's evidence of coercion or manipulation, the author has no right to interfere.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's interfering in a legal and consensual relationship between two adults, based on his own discomfort and assumptions.\n"
