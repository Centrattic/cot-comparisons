He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. \n\nFirst, the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. But the poster is concerned about the age difference. They mention that the girl looks younger and that a few months ago it would have been illegal, which probably refers to the age of consent. But since she's now 18, that's not the case anymore.\n\nThe poster says they've tried to prevent the relationship by talking to both the friend and the girl. The friend is feeling lonely and has had trouble with relationships before. The girl seems to be interested, but the poster isn't sure if it's romantic or just friendly.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the poster is in the wrong. Legally, the friend can date whoever he wants as long as both are adults. The poster's actions involve trying to interfere, which could be seen as overstepping. Friends can give advice, but actively trying to prevent someone from forming a relationship might not be their place. The poster is acting out of concern, but they might be assuming the girl is too young without considering her maturity or her own agency. Also, the poster isn't in a position to decide who their friend can date. The girl's feelings and consent are important here. If she's of age and willing, the poster's interference could be seen as controlling. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a consensual adult relationship.\n"
