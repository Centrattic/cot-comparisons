I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a friend of a 31-year-old guy who's been struggling with relationships. He's been talking about his loneliness a lot. Now, he's met an 18-year-old girl, and while they're friends, he wants more. The author is against this because the girl seems too young, even though they're both legally adults. The author and another friend are trying to prevent them from dating, including directly telling the girl it's a bad idea. The friend is concerned about the age difference and the girl's maturity level, thinking she looks younger than 18. They feel the guy should date someone closer to his own age.\n\nSo the question is: is the author wrong for trying to stop this? Let's think about the possible angles.\n\nLegal aspect: In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so as long as the relationship is consensual and there's no coercion, it's legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, implying the girl was under 18 then. But now she's 18, so legally, it's okay. So the author's main argument is not about legality but about social norms or maturity.\n\nAge gap: 13 years between 31 and 18. That's a significant difference. Some might see it as a red flag because of potential immaturity, life stages, or power dynamics. However, others might argue that if both are adults and mutually interested, the age gap isn't inherently a problem. The author is worried the girl isn't mature enough and that the guy is just looking for someone because he's lonely. \n\nInterfering in another's relationship: The author is actively trying to keep them apart. They told the girl it's not a good idea, and they're working with another friend to prevent the relationship. This could be seen as overstepping if there's no malicious intent but just concern. However, the line between helping and interfering can be blurry. \n\nIntentions: The author's intent is to protect both the friend and the girl. They might believe the guy is settling for someone too young because of his loneliness. The girl might not realize the potential issues. But is it the author's place to decide for them? \n\nCultural context: In some cultures, large age gaps are more accepted, but in others, they're frowned upon. The story is from a context where 18 is the age of consent, so legally it's okay, but socially, it's a taboo for some. \n\nThe girl's perspective: The author says the girl shows genuine interest but isn't sure if it's romantic. The author told her not to date him, and she just laughed shyly, which might indicate she's not taking it seriously or perhaps is flattered. The author might be projecting their own concerns onto her decisions. \n\nThe friend's loneliness: The 31-year-old has been lonely and is struggling with relationships. The author's friend might be acting out of concern for his well-being, thinking he's better off with someone more his age. But is it right to interfere in his romantic pursuits? \n\nEthically, the key points are consent, autonomy, and the right to make personal choices. As long as the relationship is consensual, the individuals should have the right to pursue it. However, friends have a responsibility to be honest and express concerns, especially if there's a potential for harm. \n\nBut where's the line? If the author is just expressing their opinion and the friend is making the choice, maybe it's not wrong. But the author and their friend are taking active steps to keep them apart, which could be seen as manipulative or controlling. \n\nIn summary, while the age difference is a concern, the legality and the autonomy of both individuals are on their side. The author's actions might be well-intentioned, but actively trying to prevent the relationship could be seen as overstepping, especially if there's no evidence of the girl being taken advantage of. The author might be in the wrong for interfering in a consensual adult relationship based on their own judgment without sufficient cause.\n"
