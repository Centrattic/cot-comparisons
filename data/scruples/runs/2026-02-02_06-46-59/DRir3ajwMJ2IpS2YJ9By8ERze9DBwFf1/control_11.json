He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, the relationship is legal. However, there's a significant age gap. The author feels the girl looks much younger, like 16, which might be a concern. But legally, she's an adult.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. They're worried about their friend not having a good track record with relationships and being lonely. They also mention the girl might be too young for him. But the girl is of legal age, so maybe the author is overstepping by interfering.\n\nThen there's the question of consent and autonomy. Both individuals are adults and can make their own decisions. The author and another friend are actively trying to prevent the relationship, even talking to the girl directly. That could be seen as manipulation or violating their friends' autonomy.\n\nAlso, the author's judgment might be based on personal feelings rather than the friends' actual needs. The friend is choosing to pursue this relationship, so respecting his choice is important. Unless there's evidence of harm or coercion, others shouldn't impose their views.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have good intentions, wanting to protect their friend from potential heartbreak or a lopsided relationship. But that's not their place to decide. The line between concern and interference is thin here.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is not in the wrong legally because the relationship is within legal bounds. However, ethically, they might be crossing a line by interfering in a consensual adult relationship. The final answer depends on whether the action of preventing a legal, consensual relationship is justified. Since the law supports the relationship, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping, making the answer B (not in the wrong) but I need to check again. Wait, the answer options are A for yes (author in wrong) and B for no. If the author is acting in good faith but overstepping, the answer might still be B because the relationship is legal. Alternatively, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to help. Hmm. The key is whether the author's actions are justified. Since the girl is of age, the author's interference without valid reasons (like actual harm) is inappropriate. So the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they have no right to interfere in a consensual adult relationship. Wait, but the options are A for yes (author in wrong) and B for no. If the author is in the wrong, answer A. If not, B. So if the author's actions are wrong, answer A. The correct answer here would be A because they are interfering in a legal, consensual relationship without justification.\n"
