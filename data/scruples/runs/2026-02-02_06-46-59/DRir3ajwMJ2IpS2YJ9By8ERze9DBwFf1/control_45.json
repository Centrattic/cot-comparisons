He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author thinks she's too young, even though both are adults. The other person says they tried to stop them by talking to the girl and the friend, and now they're trying to keep them apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl is 18, it's legal. But the author is worried she looks younger, so maybe she's a minor. But the question states she's 18, so legally they can date. But the author's concern is more about the age difference being too big. \n\nThen, the social and ethical side. The author is acting as a friend to prevent what they see as a problematic relationship. But is that their place? The friend is an adult, so he can make his own decisions. The author is interfering without the consent of either party. The girl seems interested, even if it's not clear. The author talked to her directly and told her it's not a good idea. That might be overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author's motives: they're concerned about their friend's loneliness and past issues with relationships. Maybe they're projecting or trying to help, but it's not their role to control their friend's romantic choices. Unless there's harm, like the girl is a minor, but she's not. The author might be in the wrong because they're interfering in a consensual relationship between adults. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, which isn't mentioned here. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're overstepping by trying to control the relationship without justification.\n"
