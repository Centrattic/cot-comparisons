He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 31-year-old friend wanting to get closer to an 18-year-old girl, and the poster is trying to prevent it. They think the girl is too young and legally, it was illegal just months ago. They've tried discouraging both friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, the relationship would be legal now. But maybe the poster is thinking of past laws or different jurisdictions? Wait, the user mentions that just a couple of months ago it would have been illegal. That might suggest that the girl is 18 now, and the age difference is 13 years. So if the girl is 18 now, then in most places, even if she was 16 before, the age of consent is 18. So if she's 18, then the age difference is legal. However, some places have close-in-age exemptions, but generally, 18 is legal. So the legal aspect isn't the issue here anymore.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The poster is a friend trying to prevent the relationship. The question is whether that's their place. The friend is an adult, so even if the poster thinks it's a bad idea, they can't control the friend's decisions. The poster says they spoke to the girl and she laughed shyly, which might indicate she's not offended. But the poster is still trying to keep them apart. \n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The girl might be seen as less experienced, so the older person might have more influence. But both are adults. The friend is lonely and hasn't had luck with women before, so maybe he's desperate. The poster's intention is to protect their friend from a potentially unhealthy situation. But is it their right to interfere?\n\nThe poster is acting out of concern, but friends have boundaries. It's one thing to express concerns and another to actively try to prevent the relationship. The poster is taking actions beyond just talking, like conspiring with another friend to keep them apart. That could be overstepping. \n\nAlso, the poster assumes the girl's interest isn't genuine or is just friendly. They can't know for sure. The girl might be mature for her age. The poster's judgment based on appearance (thinking she looks 16) is subjective and not a valid reason.\n\nIn terms of the poster's actions, they went to the girl directly and told her it wouldn't be a good idea. The girl's reaction was shy laughter, so maybe she didn't take it seriously. The poster is trying to influence both parties, which could be seen as meddlesome. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The poster is a friend, but they're not in a position to dictate who their friend can date. Even if they have good intentions, interfering in this way crosses a line. The legal age is met, and as long as both parties consent, it's their choice. The poster's actions might stem from caring, but they're not the authority on the situation. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
