He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a friend of a 31-year-old guy who's been struggling with relationships. Now this friend is interested in an 18-year-old girl, and the author, along with another friend, is trying to stop them from getting together. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so technically, the relationship would be legal. But the author feels it's too young and compares her to being 16, where it would be illegal. However, since she's 18, legally there's no issue. So maybe the author's concern is more about social norms rather than legality.\n\nNext, the author is intervening by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. The girl seems to be interested in the guy, though it's unclear if it's romantic. The guy is feeling lonely and hasn't had luck with girls, which might be why he's pursuing this. The author's friends are worried about the age gap and the girl's maturity level.\n\nBut here's the thing: even though the author has good intentions, is it their place to interfere? Friendship often involves giving advice, but where's the line between helping and overstepping? The author is actively trying to prevent a relationship that both parties are adults in. Unless there's actual harm or coercion involved, maybe the author shouldn't be the one deciding for them. The girl is 18, so she's an adult, and she's showing interest. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or undermining her autonomy.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the girl might look younger, but that's subjective. Appearance doesn't determine maturity or capability to consent. The key is whether both individuals are entering into a consensual relationship. Since the girl is of legal age, the author's intervention might not be justified. Friends can express concerns, but trying to actively prevent a relationship could be crossing a boundary unless there are clear signs of harm.\n\nIn summary, while the author's concern comes from a place of caring for their friend's well-being and possibly the girl's, the right to form relationships lies with the individuals involved. The author might not be in the wrong if they're just advising, but actively trying to keep them apart without evidence of harm could be problematic. However, since the answer options are A or B, and the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're interfering in a consensual adult relationship without a valid reason.\n"
