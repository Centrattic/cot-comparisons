He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from pursuing a relationship with an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both individuals are adults, so legally, there's no issue with the relationship. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, but since the girl is now 18, it's legal. So the legal angle isn't a concern here.\n\nNext, the social and ethical considerations. The author believes the girl is too young, even though she's 18, and that she looks younger. The author is actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to both the friend and the girl. The question is whether this interference is appropriate.\n\nThe friend is feeling lonely and has had trouble with relationships. The author is acting out of concern, thinking the girl might be \"way too young\" and possibly not a good match. However, the girl is an adult and the one showing some interest. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if they're trying to influence the girl's decisions directly.\n\nAnother point is that the author is taking it upon themselves to decide who their friend can or can't be with, which might infringe on the friend's autonomy. The friend is an adult and should have the right to make his own romantic choices, even if others disagree. The author's actions could be considered manipulative or controlling, especially if they're trying to keep them apart without the consent of either party.\n\nAlso, the author's judgment about the girl's age and appearance could be based on personal biases. The girl is 18, which is the legal age of adulthood, so even if she looks younger, she's still an adult. The author's discomfort might be a reflection of their own preferences, not a valid reason to interfere.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a duty to voice concerns if there were signs of coercion or harm, but the scenario here seems to be a mutual interest between two adults. The author's friends are also involved, which could indicate a lack of respect for the friend's autonomy.\n\nPutting it all together, the author is likely overstepping by trying to prevent a consensual relationship between two adults. While their intentions might be to help their friend, the method of interference is questionable. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
