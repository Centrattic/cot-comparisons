He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so legally, the relationship would be okay. But the author is concerned about the age difference, thinking the girl looks younger. However, the girl is legally an adult, even if she appears younger. The author's main issue is the age gap, not legality. \n\nEthically, the question is more complex. The author is interfering because they believe the girl might be too young for the relationship. But since she's 18, it's a matter of personal judgment. The author is acting as a friend, trying to protect their friend from what they see as a bad decision. However, the friend is an adult and has the right to choose his own partners. The author is not a parent or legal guardian, so they don't have the authority to make that decision for him. \n\nThe girl's perspective is also important. If she's genuinely interested and they're both adults, the author's interference might not be justified. The author tried to talk to the girl and she laughed shyly, which suggests she might not take the advice seriously. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they're using other friends to keep them apart. \n\nFriendship dynamics come into play here. The author is concerned about their friend's well-being, but the method of intervention might be crossing a line. The friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships, so the author's intentions are good, but the approach might be wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intentions are to protect, the author is not in the legal wrong, but ethically, they might be overstepping by interfering in the adult decisions of their friend and the girl. The correct answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
