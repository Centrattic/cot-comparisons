He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. First, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, it's legal for them to be in a relationship. The user mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, which makes me think maybe the girl is barely 18 and looks younger. But legally, as long as they're both adults, it's allowed.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is concerned about a significant age gap. Even though both are adults, there might be a maturity difference because the girl is much younger. But the author is stepping in to stop their friend, which could be seen as interfering. The friend is an adult too, so he should have the autonomy to make his own decisions, even if they're questionable in the eyes of others.\n\nThe user is worried about their friend's loneliness and past struggles with relationships. Maybe they're projecting their own concerns and trying to protect him, but is that their place? The author is taking it upon themselves to prevent the relationship, which might not be their responsibility. Also, the girl is showing interest, so she's also an active participant here. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or overstepping, especially since the friend is an adult capable of making his own choices.\n\nAnother point: the author is not a parent or authority figure, so they don't have the right to make decisions for their friend. The friend has the legal capacity to date whoever he wants. The author's actions, like trying to keep them apart, might be unethical because it's interfering with the friend's autonomy. Unless there's a clear harm, like non-consensual behavior or exploitation, which isn't mentioned here, the author's intervention isn't justified.\n\nIn summary, even though the age gap is significant, both parties are adults, so the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent the relationship. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're overstepping by interfering in their friend's personal choices.\n"
