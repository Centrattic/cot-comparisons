He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a 31-year-old friend is interested in an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop them from getting together. The main question is whether the author is right to do so.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is a key point here. In most places, 18 is the legal age, so technically it's allowed. But the author mentions that only a few months ago it would have been illegal. Maybe the girl is just barely 18 now? That could be a factor. If the girl is only 18 and the guy is 31, the age difference is 13 years. That's a significant gap, but since both are adults, it's a matter of personal judgment rather than legality.\n\nNext, the author's reasoning. They feel the girl looks much younger, like 16, which is below the legal age. The author is worried about the power dynamic here. A 31-year-old guy and an 18-year-old girl could have different life experiences and maturity levels. The girl might not be fully aware of the consequences of a relationship with someone much older. But the girl is an adult, so she has the legal right to make her own decisions.\n\nThe author is also concerned about their friend's loneliness and lack of success with women. They might be projecting their own preferences or societal norms onto the situation. However, the friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to choose his partners, even if others think it's a bad idea. The author's actions\u2014like talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart\u2014could be seen as overstepping. Friends can offer advice, but actively interfering in another person's romantic life without their consent might not be fair.\n\nThe girl seems to show genuine interest, even if it's not clear if it's romantic or just friendship. The author's assumption that the girl might not be serious could be incorrect. It's possible the girl is making her own choices here. The author's actions might be based on their own discomfort rather than the girl's actual intentions or desires.\n\nAnother aspect is the author's role. As a friend, they want to help their friend not make a mistake, but they might not be in the best position to judge what's right for him. The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions, even if they lead to potential heartbreak or challenges. The author's intervention could be seen as undermining their friend's autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the author has good intentions, they might be overstepping by taking actions to prevent a relationship between two consenting adults. The legal age is met, and both individuals should have the right to pursue a relationship if they choose. The author's actions are based on personal feelings and assumptions, which might not be valid. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong by interfering in a situation where they're not the decision-makers.\n"
