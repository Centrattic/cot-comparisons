He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, there's no legal issue here. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, but since the girl is now 18, it's legal. So the legal angle isn't a factor anymore.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The author is concerned about the age gap and thinks the girl looks younger. But both are adults, so they can make their own decisions. The author's role as a friend is to offer advice, but can they control their friend's choices? The friend is an adult too, so he's entitled to his own decisions, even if others disagree.\n\nThe author is actively trying to prevent the relationship, which includes talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. That could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author's intentions are good, interfering in someone else's personal life without their consent might not be appropriate. The friend might feel his autonomy is being violated.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be a factor. The friend was lonely and had bad experiences, so maybe the author is projecting their own concerns or trying to protect their friend from potential heartbreak. But that's not the author's decision to make. The friend needs to learn to navigate relationships on his own.\n\nThe girl's perspective is important too. The author spoke to her directly and said it wouldn't be a good idea. The girl's reaction was shy laughter, which might indicate she's aware of the age difference but isn't deterred. The author's friend is also making his own choices, even though he's hesitant.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to help, they're interfering in their friend's personal decisions. As adults, both the friend and the girl should have the autonomy to decide their relationship. The author isn't in the wrong legally or ethically because they're not forcing anyone, but their actions could be seen as meddlesome. However, the key point is that the author isn't violating any laws or clear moral boundaries, just trying to influence a friend's choice. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
