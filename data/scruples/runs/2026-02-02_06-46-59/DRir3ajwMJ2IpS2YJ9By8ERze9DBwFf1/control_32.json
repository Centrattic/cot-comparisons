He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. First, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, the relationship wouldn't be illegal. However, the author is concerned about the age difference, suggesting the girl looks younger and that the relationship is inappropriate.\n\nThe author's motivations seem to stem from caring about their friend's well-being, given the friend's past loneliness and lack of success with relationships. The author and another friend are actively trying to keep them apart, even talking to the girl and discouraging the friend. \n\nBut where is the line between helping a friend and overstepping? The author isn't the one in the relationship, so they might not be the best judge of the girl's intentions. The girl is an adult, and if both parties consent, it's their choice. The author's actions could be seen as interfering with the autonomy of both their friend and the girl. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend is awkward and might not be good at reading signals. The girl's shy reaction to the author's warning might indicate she's not interested in the friend, but the author is making assumptions. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author's intentions are good, they might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap onto others. The key point is that both individuals are adults and have the right to make their own decisions. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, the author has no right to prevent them from pursuing a relationship. Therefore, the author might be overstepping by interfering, even if they think they're helping.\n"
