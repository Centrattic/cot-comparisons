He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Both the man (31) and the girl (18) are adults, so legally, there's nothing illegal about their relationship in most places. The age of consent varies, but 18 is generally the cutoff in many countries, so from a legal standpoint, the author's concerns about it being illegal are outdated or incorrect. The user mentioned that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but now the girl is 18, so that's no longer a factor.\n\nNext, the ethical and moral angle. The author is interfering in their friend's personal life, possibly based on their own feelings of discomfort. The question is whether they have the right to do that. Friends often give advice, but when does it cross into controlling behavior? The author is actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. This could be seen as overstepping, especially since the girl is an adult who can make her own decisions. The author might be projecting their own discomfort or not trusting their friend's judgment.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that the girl \"might as well be 16\" is subjective. Looks can be deceiving, and age is a number. The girl is an adult, so her maturity and agency should be respected. The author's actions might be based on personal bias rather than the girl's actual maturity level.\n\nAdditionally, the friend's loneliness and lack of past success with women are factors. The author is dismissing the girl as a potential partner without knowing her intentions or maturity. The girl shows genuine interest, which suggests she's not just playing a game. The author's approach could be harmful to their friend's emotional well-being by denying him a chance at a relationship.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of being a concerned friend. The author might genuinely care and want to protect both their friend and the girl. Maybe they feel their friend isn't ready for a relationship or the girl isn't mature enough. However, unless there's evidence of harm, it's not the author's place to intervene like that. The friends should focus on supporting each other rather than controlling their relationships.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to protect, their actions are interfering with their friend's autonomy and the girl's agency. Since both are adults, they have the right to choose their partners. The author is in the wrong for overstepping and trying to control the situation without justification.\n"
