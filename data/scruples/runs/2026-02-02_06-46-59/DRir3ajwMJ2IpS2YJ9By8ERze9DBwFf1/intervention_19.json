He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to stop their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The situation is that the friend is 31, and the girl is 18. The author feels the girl is too young, even though both are adults. They've tried to prevent the relationship by talking to both parties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, 18 is the age of consent, so legally, the relationship is allowed. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would be illegal, which might refer to the girl being under 18 at some point, but now she's 18. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is concerned about the age gap. But since both are adults, it's a matter of their own choice. The author is interfering, which might be overstepping. Friends can give advice, but trying to control others' relationships is another matter. The author's actions include talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nAlso, the friend is feeling lonely and has a genuine connection with the girl. The author's motivation might stem from concern, but enforcing their own opinion on age appropriateness isn't their place. The girl is an adult too, so if she's interested, her autonomy matters. The author's judgment about the girl's maturity based on her appearance is also questionable because age is just a number, and maturity varies.\n\nIn many cases, people might have different views on age gaps. The author's discomfort doesn't necessarily justify interference. Respect for others' choices is key. Unless there's coercion or harm, it's not the author's role to intervene. So the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
