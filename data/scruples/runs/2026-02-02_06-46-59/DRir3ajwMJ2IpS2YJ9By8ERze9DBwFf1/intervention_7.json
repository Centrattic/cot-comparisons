He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is 31 and has had trouble with relationships. He's now interested in an 18-year-old girl they've met. The writer is concerned she's too young, even though she's legally an adult. They've tried to stop their friend by talking to the girl and another friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. Let me break down the possible angles. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship would be legal. However, the writer feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger, maybe even 16. The writer's reasoning is that just a few months ago, the girl would have been under the age of consent, so they're uncomfortable. \n\nBut where does personal choice come into play? The friend is an adult, and the girl is an adult. As friends, they might be overstepping by trying to interfere in their friend's romantic decisions. Unless there's something exploitative going on, like a significant power imbalance or the girl not being genuinely interested, the writer's actions might be seen as meddlesome. \n\nThe writer mentions that the girl is showing genuine interest, but they can't tell if it's friendly or more. That's a bit of a red flag for the writer, but maybe they're projecting their own discomfort. The friend has been lonely, and the writer is trying to find other ways to keep them apart. However, as friends, they might not have the right to make decisions for their friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer's concern could be valid if they suspect the girl isn't a suitable match or if there's a power dynamic. But since both are adults and the relationship is legal, it's more about personal preference. The writer's actions\u2014talking to the girl directly and trying to prevent the relationship\u2014could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering in their friend's adult decisions without clear justification beyond their own discomfort. Unless there's abuse or manipulation, adults can make their own choices. The writer's actions are controlling and not respecting their friend's autonomy.\n"
