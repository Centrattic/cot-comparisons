He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 31-year-old friend wanting to date an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, but there might be close-in-age exemptions. Since the girl is 18, legally, there's no issue. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, but now she's 18. So legally, it's okay.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author thinks the girl is too young and \"creeps out\" about it. But they're both adults. The girl seems to have genuine interest, and the friend is just being awkward. The author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. But unless there's some coercion or harm, the author might be overstepping. The girl's autonomy is important here. If she's not being forced, maybe the author shouldn't meddle.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation: their friend has had trouble with relationships and is lonely. The author might be acting out of concern, but that doesn't justify controlling the friend's love life. The other friend is involved too, trying to find ways to keep them apart. This could be seen as bullying or stifling their friend's happiness.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to protect their friend from potential heartbreak if the girl isn't interested. But the girl shows some interest, so it's unclear. The author's judgment about the girl's age might be based on appearance, which isn't a valid reason. It's possible the girl is mature and the age difference isn't a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has good intentions, they're infringing on their friend's autonomy and the girl's choices. Unless there's evidence of manipulation or harm, the author is in the wrong for interfering.\n"
