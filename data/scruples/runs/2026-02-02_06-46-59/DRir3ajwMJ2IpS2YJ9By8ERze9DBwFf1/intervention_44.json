He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend is 31, the girl is 18. The author and another friend are discouraging the relationship. The author thinks the girl is too young and that the friend should date someone closer to his age. The girl is just a few months over 18, which the author mentions was illegal before, implying maybe she's 18 now. The author even told the girl directly it's not a good idea, and the girl responded shyly. The friend is feeling lonely and the author is trying to keep them apart.\n\nNow, considering the age difference. In most places, 18 is the legal age of consent, so technically, the relationship isn't illegal. However, societal norms might still view a 13-year age gap as significant. But the author's role here is to interfere. Are they overstepping?\n\nThe author is acting as a friend, trying to protect their friend from what they perceive as a bad match. But does that justify intervening? The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. The author's actions include directly talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. That might be crossing a line. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age gap onto the situation, rather than respecting their friend's autonomy.\n\nAlso, the girl is 18, which is the legal age, so unless there's coercion or manipulation, it's her choice as well. The author's judgment about the girl's maturity based on her appearance is subjective. Just because she looks younger doesn't mean she isn't capable of consent or a healthy relationship.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as controlling. The friend is an adult and should decide for himself. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's autonomy and for interfering in a way that's not their place. Even if they have good intentions, overstepping can lead to issues. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
