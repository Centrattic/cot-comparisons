He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 31-year-old friend wanting to get closer to an 18-year-old girl. The author is trying to stop them from getting together.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: in many places, 18 is the age of consent, so technically, it's legal for them to date. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger. The author's reasoning might be based on perception rather than actual age. The girl is 18, which is an adult age, so legally, there's no issue.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is interfering in their friend's personal life. Even if the author is concerned, it's not their place to dictate who their friend can or can't date unless there's harm involved. The girl isn't a minor, so there's no legal grounds for interference. The author might be projecting their own discomfort or societal norms about age gaps, but age itself doesn't necessarily determine the health of a relationship.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to talking to the girl directly and discouraging her. That could be seen as manipulative, especially if the girl wasn't aware of the author's motivations. The author is taking actions that go beyond a simple concern, like actively trying to keep them apart. That's overstepping boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to help their friend, thinking they deserve someone closer in age. But that's subjective. The friend has the right to choose his own partner. The author's actions might stem from a place of care, but the method is questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're interfering without justification and not respecting their friend's autonomy. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Wait, but wait. The options are A for yes (author in wrong) and B for no. But maybe the answer is B? Because technically, the author isn't breaking any laws, but morally? Well, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the girl is 18, and the author is just concerned, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Hmm. But the way they're acting\u2014interfering, talking to the girl directly\u2014is overstepping. So A makes sense. Yeah, the answer is A.\n"
