He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend is 31, the girl is 18. They're getting along, but the author thinks the girl is too young and is trying to stop the relationship. The key points here are the age difference and the author's actions.\n\nLegal age of consent in many places is 18, so technically, the relationship is legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would have been illegal, maybe implying that the girl might be under 18. But according to the current info, she's 18. So legally, there's no issue.\n\nEthically, age differences can be a concern if there's a power imbalance or if one party is not mature enough. However, the girl is an adult, so she's legally capable of making her own decisions. The author's reasoning is based on personal discomfort and the friend's past loneliness, but that doesn't necessarily justify interfering.\n\nThe author is actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to both parties and avoiding interactions. This could be seen as overstepping because the individuals involved are adults and should have the autonomy to make their own choices unless there's a clear harm involved.\n\nThe friend is lonely and the girl shows some interest, so the author's actions might be\u51fa\u4e8e good intentions, but they're not the ones making the decisions here. Unless there's evidence of exploitation or manipulation, the author has no right to intervene. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal, consensual relationship between two adults without valid justification beyond personal opinion.\n"
