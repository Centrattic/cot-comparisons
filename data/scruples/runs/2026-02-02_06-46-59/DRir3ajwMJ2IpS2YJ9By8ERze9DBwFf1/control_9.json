He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. So, first, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so if the girl is 18, it might be legal. But the user mentions that just a couple of months ago it would be illegal. Maybe the girl turned 18 recently, so the age difference is significant. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Even if it's legal, some people might think there's a big age gap. The friend is 31, and she's 18. That's a 13-year difference. The user feels it's too young and that the girl looks younger. They're worried about her being mature enough for a relationship with someone older. \n\nBut the user is interfering by talking to both the friend and the girl. They told the girl it wouldn't be a good idea, and she laughed shyly. The friend is feeling lonely and might not realize the girl's intentions. The user is trying to prevent the relationship, maybe out of concern for their friend's well-being. \n\nHowever, the user isn't the one in the relationship. They're making decisions for others, which could be seen as overstepping. The girl is an adult, so she can make her own choices. Even if the user thinks she's too young-looking, she's legally an adult. The user's actions might be based on their own discomfort rather than the friends' actual needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might be worried about their friend getting hurt, especially since he's been lonely and might not see the potential issues. But is it their place to decide who their friend dates? It's possible that the user is projecting their own values about age gaps onto their friend. \n\nIn terms of consent and legality, unless there's some specific law making this illegal, the author's actions could be seen as meddling. The right to form relationships is a personal choice, even if others disagree. The user's intervention might not be their responsibility, so they could be in the wrong for interfering.\n"
