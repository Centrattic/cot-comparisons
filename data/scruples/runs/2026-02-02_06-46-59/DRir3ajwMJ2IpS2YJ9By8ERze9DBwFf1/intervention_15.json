He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author and another friend are actively trying to keep them apart. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, both 18 and 31 are adults, so there's no legal issue here. But the user mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, which probably refers to the age of consent. Since the girl is now 18, it's legal. So the author's main argument isn't about legality.\n\nThen there's the social and personal relationship aspect. The author is concerned about the age difference. The girl might look younger, but she's a legal adult. The author is trying to prevent the relationship based on their own discomfort. But where does one draw the line? If two adults are consenting, even if one is slightly younger, isn't it their choice? The author is interfering without being asked, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe friend in question is feeling lonely and has been struggling with relationships. The author is discouraging him from pursuing a connection he's interested in. That could be harmful to his emotional well-being. The author's actions might be controlling or meddlesome, even if they have good intentions. \n\nAlso, the author admitted to talking to the girl directly and telling her it's not a good idea. That's a bit of a breach, as the girl's autonomy is being undermined. The author isn't the one to decide for the girl what's right for her. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is concerned about the girl being taken advantage of. But since the girl is 18, she's an adult and can make her own decisions. The author's judgment that she looks 16 might be subjective and not a valid reason to interfere. \n\nSo considering all these points, the author is interfering in a situation where it's not their place to do so. The fact that both parties are adults and the relationship is legal means the author's actions are overreaching. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
