He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the legal age of consent is 16 or 18, so an 18-year-old is legally an adult. However, some jurisdictions have close-in-age exemptions, but the key point here is that both individuals are adults. The writer might be uncomfortable because the girl looks younger, but legally, it's permissible.\n\nNext, the writer and their friend are intervening by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. The writer's friend is 31, and the girl is 18. Age differences in relationships are common, but the writer feels the girl is \"way too young.\" The question is whether the writer has the right to interfere in their friend's personal decisions, especially romantic ones.\n\nThe writer's motivation is concern for their friend's well-being. They might think the girl is too immature, but they haven't provided evidence. The girl shows genuine interest, and the friend is lonely. The writer's actions could be seen as controlling or overstepping, especially since the friend is an adult capable of making his own choices.\n\nEthically, while the writer has good intentions, they are not the ones in the relationship. Unless there's a clear exploitation or harm, it's not their place to interfere. The writer's actions might be based on their own discomfort rather than objective harm. The friend's autonomy should be respected, even if the relationship is risky or unconventional.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer is overstepping by trying to control their friend's romantic life without justification beyond their own discomfort. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
