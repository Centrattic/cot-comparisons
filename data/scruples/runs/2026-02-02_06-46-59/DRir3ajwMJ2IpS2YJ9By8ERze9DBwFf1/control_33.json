He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old. First, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 18 is legal. The author mentions that just a few months ago it would have been illegal, but now it's legal. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author is concerned about a significant age gap. While the girl is an adult, some might argue that 18 is still quite young, and there's a potential power imbalance because the friend is older and more experienced. However, others might say that if both parties are consenting adults, it's their choice.\n\nThe author is acting out of concern for their friend's well-being, thinking he might not be choosing the best partner. But is it their place to intervene? Friends often give advice, but this is more about controlling their friend's relationships. The author even told the girl directly not to date him, which might be overstepping. The girl's reaction was shy laughter, so maybe she didn't take it seriously.\n\nAlso, the author and their friend are trying to keep them apart, which could be seen as meddling. While they have good intentions, the decision to date should be up to the two individuals involved. The author's actions might be based on their own discomfort rather than the actual best interest of their friend. It's possible that the friend is capable of making his own decisions, even if he's not the most confident in relationships.\n\nSo, balancing all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be overstepping by trying to control the relationship. However, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the girl is an adult, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for interfering in a consensual relationship between two adults.\n"
