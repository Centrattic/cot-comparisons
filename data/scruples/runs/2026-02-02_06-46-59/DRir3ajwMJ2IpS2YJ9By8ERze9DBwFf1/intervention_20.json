He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from pursuing an 18-year-old girl.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is a key point here. In many places, 18 is the legal age, so technically, there's no law against this relationship. The writer mentions that just months ago it would be illegal, but now it's just two adults. So maybe the writer is focused on the age difference more than the legal aspect.\n\nNext, the writer is a friend, not a parent or authority figure. While friends can offer advice, trying to prevent the relationship by intervening directly might cross a line. The girl is also an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions. The writer approached the girl directly and told her it's not a good idea, which might be seen as overstepping, especially since the girl is an adult and capable of making her own choices.\n\nThe writer's motivation is concern for the friend's well-being and possibly their own discomfort with the age gap. But is it their place to make that decision? The friend is an adult too, and while he might be awkward, he has the right to pursue relationships as he sees fit. The writer's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if they're using other friends to keep them apart.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer might be trying to protect their friend from potential heartbreak or a lopsided relationship. But that's speculative. The writer hasn't seen evidence that the relationship is harmful, just that they're uncomfortable with the age difference.\n\nSo, considering all this, the friend's autonomy is important. The writer isn't in a position to make decisions for two adults. Therefore, the answer is likely that the writer is in the wrong.\n"
