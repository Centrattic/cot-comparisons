He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, so there's a 13-year age gap. Both are adults legally, but the author feels the girl looks younger and is concerned about the legality if she were under 18. \n\nFirst, legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so if the girl is exactly 18, it's legal. However, if she looks younger, maybe the author is worried she might be underage. But the scenario states she's 18, so legally, it's okay.\n\nEthically, age gaps can be a sensitive topic. Some people might think a 13-year gap isn't inherently wrong if both are adults. Others might feel the older person has more life experience and could take advantage. The author's intention is to protect their friend from potential issues, but it's their friend's choice. The author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. \n\nThe friend has been lonely and maybe the author is acting out of concern. However, the girl is showing genuine interest, and the author's actions might be overstepping. The author isn't the one in the relationship, so they shouldn't dictate their friend's romantic choices unless there's harm involved. If the girl is 18, the author's actions could be seen as meddling without just cause. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're interfering in their friend's adult decisions without a valid legal reason. Unless there's exploitation, the friend can choose who to date. The author's concern is valid, but their approach is overreach.\n"
