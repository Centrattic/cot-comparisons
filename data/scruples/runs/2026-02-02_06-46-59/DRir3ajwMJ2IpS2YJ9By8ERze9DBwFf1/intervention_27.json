He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 31-year-old friend wanting to pursue an 18-year-old girl. The author and another friend are trying to prevent this, even going as far as to discourage the girl and the friend.\n\nFirst, let me consider the legal aspect. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so technically, a 31-year-old and an 18-year-old can legally engage in a relationship. However, the author feels it's too young and the girl looks younger, which might be a point of concern. But legally, it's allowed. \n\nNext, the author's motivation. They mention that their friend has had no luck with girls and is feeling miserable. The author is trying to protect their friend from potential issues, maybe seeing the girl as too inexperienced or there being a significant age gap. But is that their place to decide? Relationships are between the individuals involved, and while friends can offer advice, actively trying to prevent the relationship might cross a line. \n\nThe author said outright to the girl that it wouldn't be a good idea. That could be seen as meddling. The girl laughed shyly, which might indicate she's aware but not taking it seriously. The author is also trying to find other ways to keep them apart. This intervention goes beyond giving advice and into manipulation, which could be problematic.\n\nThe age difference is 13 years. While some might find that significant, others might not. The author's discomfort is subjective. They argue that the girl looks younger, but that's a physical perception, not an actual age. Since both are adults, it's their choice to date each other. \n\nThe key question is whether the author has the right to interfere. Friends can express concerns, but actively working to prevent a relationship isn't their role. The author might be projecting their own views on what's appropriate, not considering the autonomy of their friend and the girl. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is overstepping by trying to meddle in their friend's personal life. Even if their intentions are good, the method is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
