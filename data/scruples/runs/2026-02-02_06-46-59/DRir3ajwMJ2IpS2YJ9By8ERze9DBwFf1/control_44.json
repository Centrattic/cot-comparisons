He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is feeling lonely and has been struggling with relationships, and the author and another friend are trying to stop them from getting together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 to 18, so an 18-year-old is legally an adult. The author mentions that just a few months ago, it would have been illegal, which makes me think maybe the girl was turning 18, so the situation is now legal. So there's no legal issue here.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is concerned about the age difference, but both are adults. The question is about whether the age gap itself is a problem. Some people might argue that a 13-year age gap (31 vs. 18) could create power imbalances or differences in maturity, but others might say that as long as both are adults and consent is present, it's their choice. The author's main concern seems to be the girl's age and maturity, but she's 18, so she's legally an adult. The author's judgment about her looking younger is subjective.\n\nAlso, the author is interfering in their friend's personal life. The friend has been lonely and is seeking a relationship, and the author is actively trying to prevent it. While friends often give advice, taking active steps to keep them apart might be overstepping. The author hasn't consulted the friend's own feelings or preferences enough. The friend might have the right to make his own decisions about relationships, even if others disagree.\n\nAnother angle: the author is acting out of concern for their friend's well-being, which is understandable. But the method of intervention\u2014actively trying to keep them apart without the friend's consent\u2014could be problematic. It's possible that the friend would appreciate advice but not manipulation. Also, the author is making assumptions about the girl's intentions and the girl's maturity, which might not be accurate.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might find a 13-year gap unusual, but it's not unheard of. The key factors here are mutual consent and the legal age. Since both parties are adults, the decision to date is their own. The author's actions might be seen as controlling, even if done with good intentions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be overstepping by interfering in their friend's decisions. The friend has the autonomy to choose his relationships, and while the author's concern is valid, the method of intervention is questionable. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but there are valid points on both sides. Wait, but some might argue that the author is in the wrong because they're manipulating the situation. Hmm. Need to check again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the law isn't broken, and the author's actions are based on their own concerns, but they're not the ones in the relationship. The friend's autonomy is key here. So the answer might be B.\n"
