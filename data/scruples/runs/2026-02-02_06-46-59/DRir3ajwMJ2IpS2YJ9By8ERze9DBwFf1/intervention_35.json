He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is 31, the girl is 18, both adults. The author and another friend are actively trying to stop them, even talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so if the girl is 18 and the friend is 31, they are legally adults. However, the user mentions that \"a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal,\" implying that the girl was under 18. But since she's now 18, that's no longer the case. So legally, there's no issue here.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The author is concerned about the age gap, even though both are adults. The user's reasoning is that the girl seems too young, maybe looking 16, and they find the idea of their friend dating her creepy. The main ethical question is whether the author has the right to interfere in their friend's personal relationships. \n\nFriendship boundaries: The author is a friend, not a parent. Friends can give advice, but actively trying to prevent a relationship, especially by talking to the girl directly and trying to keep them apart, might cross a line. The friend is an adult who can make his own decisions. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since they're not the one involved.\n\nIntentions: The author's intention is to prevent what they see as a bad match. They might think they're helping their friend, but they could be projecting their own biases or discomfort with age gaps. The key here is whether the author has the right to make that decision for their friend.\n\nAlso, the girl's perspective is important. The author talked to her directly and told her it wouldn't be a good idea. That could be seen as interfering in her autonomy. She's an adult, so she has the right to make her own decisions about relationships, even if the author disapproves.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions the friend is awkward and has had trouble with relationships. The friend might be genuinely interested in the girl, and the author's intervention could be based on jealousy or a desire to protect their friend, which is well-meaning but possibly misguided.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions come from a place of concern for their friend, interfering in their personal relationships without their consent is generally considered overstepping. The friend is an adult, and both individuals are legally able to date. The author's actions may be unethical because they're making decisions for their friend and the girl without their input, which is not their place to do. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
