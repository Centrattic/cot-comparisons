He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reached out (AITA) is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The friend is struggling with relationships and the girl is just turning 18, which is legal. The author is concerned about the age difference and thinks the girl looks younger than her age. They've tried to stop the relationship, even talking to the girl directly.\n\nFirst, legal age is a factor. Since the girl is 18, there's no legal issue. The author's main concern is moral or social, not legal. But does that justify their actions? The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author's role as a friend is to advise, not to control someone else's romantic choices. The girl seems to show genuine interest, so it's not clear if it's just friendly. The author's actions might be overstepping by confronting the girl and trying to keep them apart. Friends can offer opinions, but preventing someone from pursuing a relationship could be seen as meddling. The answer likely leans toward the author being in the wrong because they're interfering in an adult relationship without legal justification. Plus, the friend is capable of making his own decisions, even if they're not ideal. The author's actions might come off as controlling. So, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
