He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. The situation involves the author and another friend actively trying to keep them apart, even going as far as talking to the girl directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so legally, the relationship would be allowed. However, the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger, even though she's 18. But legally, that's not a factor. The age difference here is 13 years, which is a significant gap, but both parties are adults. The author is concerned about the power dynamics or maturity levels, but as long as both are consenting adults, it's their choice.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author is intervening in their friend's personal life. Even if they have good intentions, like protecting their friend from potential heartbreak or social judgment, they don't have the right to dictate others' romantic choices. The friend is an adult and capable of making his own decisions. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially since they've directly approached the girl to discourage her.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the girl might be interested, but they can't be sure. It's possible the friend is being cautious, and the girl's interest isn't as clear as the author thinks. However, the author's approach of trying to prevent the relationship without the friend's consent could be harmful. The friend's autonomy should be respected.\n\nAnother point is the author's motivation. They might be driven by concern for their friend's well-being, but it's important to consider whether this concern is valid or if they're projecting their own discomfort with the age difference. The author's actions could be based on personal bias rather than objective facts about the relationship's health.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be good, the act of interfering in the friend's romantic decisions without consent is likely inappropriate. The legal aspect isn't an issue, and the ethical considerations point towards the author being in the wrong for not respecting their friend's autonomy.\n"
