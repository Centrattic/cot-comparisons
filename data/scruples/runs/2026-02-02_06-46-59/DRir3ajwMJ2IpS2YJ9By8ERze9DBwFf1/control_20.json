He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18, which is legal since both are adults. But the author feels she's too young, maybe looks younger, and is worried about the age gap.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 18 is definitely legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, which suggests maybe the girl is just turning 18 or close to that. But since she is 18 now, it's legal. So the author's concern isn't about legality but personal opinion on age.\n\nThe author's motivation is to protect their friend from a potentially problematic relationship because they think she's \"too young.\" But the girl is an adult. The problem here is that the author is interfering in their friend's personal choices. Even if the author thinks the relationship is a bad idea, the friend has the right to date whoever they want as long as it's legal and consensual.\n\nAlso, the girl might have her own agency. The author told her directly it wouldn't be a good idea, but she laughed shyly and didn't seem to take it seriously. That might indicate she's comfortable with her own decisions. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since they're using other friends to keep them apart.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned because their friend has had bad luck with women and feels lonely. They might be trying to help by steering him towards more age-appropriate partners. But the key here is whether the author has the right to make that decision for their friend. Generally, friends should offer advice but not control others' relationships unless there's harm involved.\n\nSo the author is in the wrong because they're intervening in a legal and consensual relationship between two adults, which is their friend's personal choice. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
