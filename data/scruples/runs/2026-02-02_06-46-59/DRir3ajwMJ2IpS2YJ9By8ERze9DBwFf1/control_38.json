He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. The author is 31, the girl is 18, and they're both legally adults. The age of consent here is probably 16 or 18, depending on the jurisdiction, so technically, it's legal. But the author feels uncomfortable because the girl looks younger and the relationship might be exploitative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the girl is 18, it's legal for them to date. The author's concern about the girl looking younger is subjective and might be based on personal feelings rather than objective facts. The author is interfering without knowing the girl's true intentions and whether she's genuinely interested or just being friendly.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Friends often try to influence each other's decisions, but where's the line? The author is taking active steps to prevent the relationship, even talking directly to the girl. That could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girl isn't being coerced. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the situation, assuming the girl isn't mature enough without evidence.\n\nAlso, the friend is lonely and has had trouble with relationships. The author's actions might be well-meaning but could be dismissive of his autonomy. Everyone has the right to choose their partners, provided there's consent and no exploitation. The key here is whether the girl is a willing participant. Since she's 18, unless there's a power imbalance or manipulation, the author has no right to interfere.\n\nHowever, if the author genuinely believes there's something off about the girl's intentions or maturity, maybe they should express concerns without actively sabotaging the relationship. But the scenario doesn't mention any red flags from the girl's side. The author is acting on their own discomfort rather than concrete evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, unless there's a clear risk of harm, the author is overstepping by trying to control their friend's romantic choices. The legal age is met, and the girl's interests aren't being considered. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
