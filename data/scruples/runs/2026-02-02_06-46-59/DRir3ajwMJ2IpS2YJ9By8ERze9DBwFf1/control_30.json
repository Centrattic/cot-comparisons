He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their friend from dating an 18-year-old. First, I need to check the legal age of consent. In most places, 18 is the legal age, so technically, the relationship would be legal. The friend is 31, and the girl is 18, which is above the legal age. So legally, there's no issue.\n\nNext, the author is concerned about the age gap. They mention that the girl looks younger, maybe 16, which they say was illegal before. But since she's 18 now, that's not the case. The author is worried about the maturity gap. Even though both are adults, there's a 13-year age difference. That could lead to challenges in the relationship, but it's not illegal.\n\nThe author is taking active steps to prevent the relationship, like talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. They might be acting out of concern for their friend's well-being, but they're interfering in the friend's personal choices. The friend has the right to date whoever they want as long as it's legal. The author might not have the right to control their friend's decisions, even if they think they're wrong.\n\nAlso, the friend has been lonely and might see this as a chance for a relationship. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if they're not considering their friend's autonomy. Even if the author's intentions are good, manipulating or preventing a legal relationship isn't their place.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're interfering in a legal and consensual relationship between two adults. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
