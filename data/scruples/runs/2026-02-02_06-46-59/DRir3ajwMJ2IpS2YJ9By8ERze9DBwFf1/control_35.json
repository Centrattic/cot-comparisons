He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 31-year-old friend wanting to date an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to stop them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so technically, if both are adults, it's legal. But the author feels it's inappropriate because the girl looks younger. However, age in legal terms isn't about appearance, just chronological age. So legally, there's no issue if both are adults.\n\nNext, the author's motivation. They're concerned because their friend has been lonely and maybe not had good experiences. But are they overstepping? The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions. The author is trying to control the situation, which might not be their place. Even if they think the relationship is bad, the friend has autonomy.\n\nAlso, the girl's perspective. The author directly told her it's a bad idea, but she responded with laughter, which might indicate she's not taking it seriously. The author's actions could be seen as interfering in someone else's relationships without their consent. \n\nThere's a line between being a concerned friend and being overbearing. The author might be projecting their own discomfort with the age difference rather than the girl's actual maturity. The key here is respecting the autonomy of both individuals involved. Unless there's a clear harm or coercion, the author might be in the wrong for trying to prevent a consensual relationship between two adults.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a consensual adult relationship without justification.\n"
