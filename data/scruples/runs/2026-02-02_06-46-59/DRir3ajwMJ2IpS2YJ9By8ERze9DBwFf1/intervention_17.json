He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The author feels the girl is too young, even though they're both legally adults. The friend hasn't had much success with relationships and is now interested in this girl. The author and a friend have been trying to discourage them, with the author even confronting the girl directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship would be legal. But the author is concerned about the girl looking younger and the age gap. The question is whether the author has the right to interfere in their friend's personal choices, even if they're legally allowed.\n\nThen, there's the ethical angle. The author might be motivated by concern for their friend's well-being, thinking he's not ready for a relationship or that the girl is too young in terms of maturity. On the other hand, the friend is an adult and has the right to choose his partners. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since they're trying to control the situation by keeping them apart.\n\nAlso, the author's own feelings about the situation might be influenced by their own discomfort. They mentioned it creeps them out, which could be a personal bias rather than a valid reason to intervene. The girl's reaction to the author's warning was to laugh shyly, which might indicate she's not receptive to the advice.\n\nAnother point is the friend's loneliness. The author's friend is struggling with loneliness, and the author's interference might be prolonging that. The friend is an adult and should have the autonomy to make his own decisions, even if others disagree. The author's actions might be based on a lack of trust in the friend's judgment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting as a gatekeeper, which is not their role. Adults should have the freedom to choose their partners, even if there's an age difference. Unless there's evidence of coercion or exploitation, the author's interference is not justified. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
