He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 31-year-old friend wanting to pursue a relationship with an 18-year-old girl, and the author is trying to prevent it.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. If the girl is 18, then legally, the relationship is allowed as both are adults. However, there's a significant age gap. Even though they're both adults, some might argue there's a power dynamic or that the girl is less experienced. But legally, it's permitted. The author mentions that \"just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal,\" which suggests the girl was under 18 before, but now she's 18. So the relationship is legal now.\n\nNext, the author is interfering by discouraging the girl and trying to keep them apart. The girl shows interest, albeit maybe not romantic, but the author is taking a strong stance. The author's friend is feeling lonely and has a history of not having luck with girls. The author's actions might be based on concern, but are they justified?\n\nEthically, even if legal, a 13-year age gap (31 vs. 18) can be seen as problematic. Some might think the older person has more life experience and could take advantage. However, others might argue that if both are consenting adults, it's their choice. The author is acting on the belief that it's a bad idea, but does that give them the right to interfere?\n\nThe author is not the girl's parent or legal guardian, so they can't make decisions for her. They tried to talk to her, but she laughed it off. Maybe they have a right to express their concerns, but actively trying to prevent the relationship could be seen as overstepping. The friend's autonomy is important here; even if the author thinks it's a bad idea, the friend has the right to make his own decisions, as long as they're legal and consensual.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation might be based on personal discomfort rather than the friend's best interest. The post mentions that the author finds the idea of the relationship \"creepy,\" which is a personal feeling, not necessarily a valid reason to interfere. The friend might see this as meddling.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has good intentions, they are overstepping by trying to control their friend's romantic decisions. The friend is an adult and should be allowed to make his own choices, even if they're unwise. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but ethically, they might be infringing on their friend's autonomy. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
