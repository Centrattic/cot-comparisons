He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for trying to stop their 31-year-old friend from getting together with an 18-year-old girl. The friend is struggling with relationships, and they've both developed some interest in each other. The author is concerned about the age difference, even though both are adults. They've tried to dissuade both parties, with some resistance.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, 18 is the age of consent, so the relationship would be legal. The author mentions that a few months ago it would be illegal, implying maybe the girl is under 18 now, but the scenario states she's 18. Wait, the post says the girl is 18, so she's an adult. The author's concern is that she looks younger, maybe 16, which is a common worry, but legally she's an adult. So, the main issue here is the age difference, even though both are adults.\n\nThe author is interfering by talking to the girl and trying to keep them apart. The question is whether that's wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nIn terms of ethics and personal relationships, people often have the right to choose their partners as long as it's legal and consensual. The author is acting out of concern for their friend's well-being, possibly seeing the girl as too young and thus an unsuitable match. However, the author is not the friend's parent or legal guardian, so they don't have the authority to prevent the relationship. The friend is an adult and can make his own decisions, even if they seem unwise.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is projecting their own discomfort. They mention being creeped out by the age difference, which is a personal feeling but shouldn't dictate someone else's relationship choices. The key here is consent and legality. Since both parties are adults, even if the girl appears younger, it's their decision.\n\nAlso, the friend has been lonely and the author is dismissing his feelings by trying to push him away from someone who shows interest. It's possible the author is overstepping by interfering in a relationship that the friend is entering into voluntarily.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to help, but their method could be problematic. Instead of trying to prevent the relationship, they might better support their friend in making his own decisions, even if they disagree. But since the actions are aimed at stopping it, without the friend's consent to do so, that could be considered wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is overstepping by trying to control the friend's romantic choices, even if their intentions are good. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
