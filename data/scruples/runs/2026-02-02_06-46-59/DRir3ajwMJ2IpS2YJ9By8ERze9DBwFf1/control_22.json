He's been feeling pretty miserable about it and has complained a lot about it, to me and my friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately he's gotten to know an 18-year old girl. They're getting along as friends, but he wants more. She seems to be exactly his type, but he's a bit too awkward to make a move. She shows some genuine interest in him, but I can't tell if it's just friendly or more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I'm convinced she is just WAY too young for him. I know they're both technically adults, but looking at her, she might as well be 16 or something. Just a couple of months ago it would literally be illegal for him to go after her. The whole thought of it just creeps me out. Why can't he go for girls his own age, or at least 24-year olds or something?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, along with another friend, I've been trying to prevent them from getting together. I already said to her outright it wouldn't be a good idea to ever start dating, but she just laughed a bit shyly. I've tried discouraging him, but he just complains about having been lonely for so long. Me and this other friend are trying to find other ways to keem him away from her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for trying to prevent a 31-year-old friend from dating an 18-year-old girl. \n\nFirst, legal age of consent varies, but in many places, 18 is the minimum. So technically, there's no legal issue here. The author is concerned about the age difference, thinking the girl looks younger. But legally, she's an adult. The author's argument hinges on the appearance and the closeness to the legal age, but since she's 18, it's a gray area morally but not illegal.\n\nEthically, some might argue that a significant age gap can lead to power imbalances, especially if the younger person is less experienced. The 18-year-old is just starting adulthood, so there's a risk of the older person having more life experience influencing the younger one. However, others might say that if both are consenting adults, it's their choice.\n\nThe author's approach of actively trying to prevent the relationship by talking to both parties could be seen as overstepping. The friend's autonomy is a factor here. While the author has good intentions, interfering in someone else's romantic choices, even if they're a friend, can be problematic. The friend is an adult and should have the right to decide who to date, as long as there's no coercion or abuse.\n\nThe other friend involved in discouraging them adds another layer. It's possible they're acting out of concern, but they're still mediating a relationship they're not part of. The key issue is whether the author has the right to intervene without being asked. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and personal ethics, but in terms of rights, if both individuals are consenting adults, the author might not be in the wrong, but they could be overreaching.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally or ethically, but their actions might be seen as intrusive. The final answer would be B (No), but with the understanding that there are valid arguments on both sides.\n"
