  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse while she gets a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he shut her down and wants to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thought it was a straightforward booking based on availability. She might not have realized the sensitivity around the male masseuse. On the other hand, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels massages are sexualized. He might feel violated or uncomfortable, which is a legitimate concern. The author offered to switch, but he refused and ended up canceling. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author didn't intend to make an argument but wanted to discuss. The boyfriend's reaction was dismissive and extreme\u2014refusing to switch and canceling. His reasoning about massages being sexual isn't something the author made up, but his response might be overreacting. However, his feelings matter, and the author should have considered his comfort level beforehand. \n\nBut wait, the author tried to switch, showing she was willing to accommodate. The boyfriend's refusal seems rigid. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she made an effort to address his concerns. However, maybe she should have checked with him before booking. But the initial booking was based on availability, not malice. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but his response was uncooperative. The author's intention was to understand, not to push. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she made an effort to resolve the issue, while the boyfriend's inconsiderate reaction is the problem. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
