  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). They scheduled their boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it, but he said she's wrong and that she's making it up to argue. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions were wrong. The key points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and communication. The boyfriend clearly stated he was uncomfortable with a male masseuse, so the author scheduled him with one. Even if she thought massages are therapeutic, she should have respected his boundary. She did offer to switch, but he didn't accept and wanted to cancel. Maybe she didn't take his discomfort seriously enough. However, she was trying to understand his reasoning and even offered to change. But the main issue is that she scheduled him without considering his preference first. Maybe she should have asked his preference before booking. But she might not have known until she told him. However, since he had a strong reaction, she should have been more mindful of his comfort. So, is she in the wrong? Possibly, because she didn't consider his prior to booking. But maybe she thought it was a neutral choice. Hmm. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme, but his right to feel that way is valid. The author's actions led to his discomfort. So maybe she's partially at fault for not checking with him first. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. Another angle: when planning together, she should have discussed preferences. Since he had a specific issue, her not anticipating it might make her at fault. Alternatively, she tried to resolve it. I think the answer leans towards A because she didn't respect his boundary immediately and continued to push for a discussion instead of just switching as he was uncomfortable. But she did offer to switch. Wait, he didn't want to switch, he wanted to cancel. So maybe she's not entirely wrong. But the initial action of scheduling without his input is the problem. So maybe A is correct.\n"
