A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author wanted to get massages together, so she booked the boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female. The boyfriend was upset, saying massages are sexual, and refused to go unless they cancel. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he was dismissive and didn't want to switch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author made a choice based on availability, perhaps assuming it's okay to split the genders. The boyfriend has a strong reaction, seeing massages as inherently sexual. But is that a valid reason? The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, which is reasonable. However, she didn't consider his comfort level beforehand. Maybe she should have checked with him before booking, but the story says she did tell him after booking. He then refused, and she tried to explain her reasoning. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that massages are sexual, but in a monogamous relationship, that might be a personal discomfort. However, the author is trying to understand his perspective. He's dismissing her reasoning as irrational, which could be his way of being defensive. The author offered to switch, which shows she tried to accommodate him, but he still wanted to cancel entirely. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? She wanted to plan something together, made a choice, and then tried to resolve the issue when it came up. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his personal discomfort and not necessarily the author's fault. She didn't force him; she offered alternatives. The key point is that she tried to be understanding and accommodating, while he was rigid. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she made an effort to resolve the issue and didn't push him beyond his comfort. The boyfriend's stance is his own discomfort, which isn't her fault.\n"
