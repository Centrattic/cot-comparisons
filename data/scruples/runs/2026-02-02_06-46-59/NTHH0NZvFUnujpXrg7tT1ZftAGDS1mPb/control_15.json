A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author, a 21-year-old female, booked her boyfriend (also 21, male) with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. When she tells him, he's upset and says he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She argues they're therapeutic, and he says her view is irrational. She tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel his appointment.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made the decision to book him with a male masseuse. Before doing so, she could have considered his possible discomfort. The boyfriend has a valid reason based on his perception of massages as sexual, which might be influenced by personal boundaries or past experiences. Even though she offered to switch, he was already upset and wanted to cancel. The author's intention was to understand and compromise, but the boyfriend's reaction was strong. \n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong. Did she overstep by scheduling him with a male masseuse without his input? Possibly. Even if she thought it was fair or balanced (since she chose a female), she might have assumed his comfort level. Since the situation ended with him canceling and her going alone, it seems like she didn't respect his boundaries enough initially. However, she tried to adjust after he expressed discomfort. But the initial action might be the issue. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's comfort levels is important. The author might have assumed she knew what's best, not considering his personal feelings. The boyfriend's discomfort is his own experience, and while she tried to discuss it, the act of scheduling without prior discussion could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because she didn't check with him first. However, others might argue that she made an effort to adjust after the fact. But the initial decision could be seen as dismissive of his potential boundaries.\n"
