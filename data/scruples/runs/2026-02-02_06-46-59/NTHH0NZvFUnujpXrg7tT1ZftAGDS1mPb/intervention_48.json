  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both wanted massages, and she chose the male masseuse for him and the female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable and says massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning, even offering to switch later. He refused to switch and wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, the author's action was based on availability and maybe splitting by gender. But the boyfriend has a strong discomfort with male masseuses, which he attributes to massages being sexual. She tried to reason and even offered to change, but he still refused. Now, the question is if she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might argue she didn't know his discomfort beforehand and was trying to be neutral. The boyfriend's discomfort is a personal issue, but he didn't mention it before booking. But the author could have checked his preferences before booking. However, she did offer to switch after knowing his feelings. He still didn't accept, leading to the cancellation. \n\nIs her initial decision wrong? Maybe she should have asked his preference first. But since they were getting massages together, perhaps splitting by gender was her assumption. But his reaction seems to be more about his own feelings than her decision. She did try to accommodate by offering to switch, so maybe she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's refusal might be his own issue. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
