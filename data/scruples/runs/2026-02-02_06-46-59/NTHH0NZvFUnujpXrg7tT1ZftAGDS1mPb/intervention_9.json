He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman, 21, and she's with her boyfriend, also 21. They both planned to get massages together. The available masseuses were male and female, so she booked her boyfriend with the male one and herself with the female. When she told him, he was uncomfortable and said he would never let a man massage him. His reasoning is that massages are inherently sexual. She thinks massages are therapeutic and tried to discuss his reasoning, maybe to understand why he feels that way and why it's okay to get a massage from the opposite sex in a monogamous relationship. He thought her opinion was irrational and accused her of arguing just to argue. She offered to switch, but he said to cancel his massage. She decided to go anyway without him. Now she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent and personal boundaries. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, his feelings are valid. He has the right to set boundaries about his body. The author might have assumed her choice was neutral, but she didn't consider his feelings beforehand. However, she did try to communicate and even offered to switch. Maybe she didn't anticipate his strong reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning about massages being \"inherently sexual\" seems a bit odd. It could be a personal belief or anxiety. If he's okay with a female masseuse, maybe it's about gender-specific discomfort. The author's intention was to split the bookings based on available options, but maybe she should have discussed it with him first instead of deciding unilaterally, even if it seems like a minor choice.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author made a decision that affected her partner without consulting him first. While the massages are a separate service, the fact that they were going together might imply a shared experience, so checking in with him would be necessary. However, when she found out his discomfort, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. His reaction of wanting to cancel and not going at all might be an overreaction, but his discomfort is his prerogative.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not discussing it first? Maybe partially. She could have asked his preference before booking. But once the issue came up, she tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's response might be more problematic, but the question is about the author's actions. Since she made a choice without his input, even if it's a small thing, it's a matter of respect. However, she did attempt to adjust, so maybe she's not entirely at fault. But the initial action of booking without asking could be seen as the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't check with her boyfriend before making the booking, which affected his comfort. But some might argue that the boyfriend's reaction is more to blame. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since she made a decision that impacted his personal comfort without prior discussion, that's a key factor. So I think the answer is A.\n"
