A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple booking massages, with the author choosing a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend objects because he finds massages inherently sexual, but the author thinks they're therapeutic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that she wanted to match the masseuse's gender with each partner, maybe assuming it's more comfortable. The boyfriend's issue is that he doesn't want a male masseuse, possibly due to the perception of massages being sexual. But he's in a monogamous relationship, so why is that a problem? Maybe he's uncomfortable with the idea of another man touching him, regardless of the context. \n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning, which is good communication. She even offered to switch, but he didn't accept. He then suggested canceling his own massage. The author went ahead without him. \n\nNow, who's right? The boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he's genuinely uncomfortable. The author's action of choosing the male masseuse without considering his feelings might have been a mistake. Even though she tried to understand, maybe she should have checked with him first instead of assuming. However, communication was happening, and he refused to switch, leading to him canceling. The author isn't forcing him; she's going ahead, which is her choice. \n\nBut was she wrong to book the male masseuse initially? If he didn't want a male masseuse, maybe she should have respected that without assuming. However, she didn't know his preference beforehand. The key is whether her action was considerate. She tried to explain her reasoning, but he was rigid. So, is the fault on her for not checking first, or on him for being inflexible? \n\nIn relationships, considering each other's feelings is important. She might have acted without prior discussion, but her intention was to discuss. Maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in checking preferences. However, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and his harsh response might make him the one in the wrong. The author's decision isn't inherently wrong, but the situation shows both sides have valid points. The answer depends on whether the initial booking was a mistake without discussion. But since she did try to discuss after, maybe she's not in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
