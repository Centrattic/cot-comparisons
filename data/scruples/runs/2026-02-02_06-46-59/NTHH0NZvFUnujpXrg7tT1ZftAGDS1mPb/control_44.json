A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse when they planned to get massages together. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and the author wanted to get massages. There were two options: a male and a female masseuse. She chose the male for him and female for herself. Her reasoning is that she thought it was a neutral, therapeutic choice. The boyfriend, however, is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he believes massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he insisted on canceling and said she was being argumentative. She's going to go without him.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consent, comfort, and communication. The author's action was based on her own perception of what's appropriate, but she didn't consider her boyfriend's feelings. Even though there were options, she made the decision without checking his preference first. The boyfriend clearly expressed his discomfort, which is valid because people have different boundaries and sensitivities. The fact that he felt it was necessary to cancel because he couldn't be comfortable with a male masseuse shows that the situation affected him personally. \n\nWhen the author tried to debate it, that might have come off as dismissive of his feelings. He wanted to avoid the situation, but she kept pushing for understanding, which he perceived as an argument. Even offering to switch could be seen as not respecting his initial choice. He's in a monogamous relationship, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's comfortable with a male masseuse. His discomfort might stem from personal beliefs or experiences, which are his to have.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not checking with her boyfriend first about his preference. She assumed her choice was neutral, but his reaction shows it wasn't. The boyfriend isn't in the wrong for having his own boundaries, and the author is at fault for not respecting them beforehand. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
