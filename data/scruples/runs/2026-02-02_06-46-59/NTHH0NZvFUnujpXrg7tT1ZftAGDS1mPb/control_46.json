  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, while the author sees them as purely therapeutic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wanted to plan a joint massage, so she chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. That seems fair since they booked together. But the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he associates massages with sexual connotations. He even refuses to switch and wants to cancel, which is making the author go without him.\n\nThe key points here are consent and comfort. The author didn't force him to get a massage from a male masseuse but made a choice based on availability. However, after he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. He refused, which might be his right, but the author is frustrated because she's trying to understand his reasoning. She's not just being argumentative but is seeking to comprehend his perspective. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to be dismissing her attempts to discuss and even accuses her of making it up to argue. He's also taking the stance that it's a sexual issue, which is a valid personal boundary, but he's not allowing her to question his logic.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author respected his initial booking but when he expressed discomfort, she tried to adjust. However, he's not open to discussion, which might be his problem. The author's actions don't seem to be in the wrong because she made an initial choice but then tried to accommodate his feelings. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his dismissal of her questions could indicate that he's not being as considerate as he could be. The author isn't forcing him but still proceeding without him. So, the wrong might lie more with the boyfriend's inflexibility and unwillingness to engage in dialogue. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
