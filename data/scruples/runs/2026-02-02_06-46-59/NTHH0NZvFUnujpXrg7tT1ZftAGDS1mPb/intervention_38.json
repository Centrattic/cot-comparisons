A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: They planned to get massages together. The author, a woman, booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with male masseurs, saying massages are inherently sexual. He refuses to go through with the male massage, suggesting cancellation. The author wanted to understand his reasoning but he dismissed her and didn't back down.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's intention was to split the massages based on the available options. She tried to understand his discomfort and even offered to switch. The boyfriend, on the other hand, labels her opinion as irrational, insists on canceling, and sees the situation as an argument. \n\nKey points to consider: Respecting personal boundaries and comfort levels. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid; if he's not okay with a male masseuse, he's within his rights to express that. The author tried to engage in a discussion, which is good, but the boyfriend didn't reciprocate openness. However, the author did offer a compromise. \n\nIs the author wrong? She didn't force him; she tried to accommodate. The issue might be that she assumed splitting by gender was neutral, but he found it problematic. Since he's the one uncomfortable, the responsibility is on him to communicate that clearly. However, the author could have considered his potential discomfort in advance. But given that she offered a solution, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that she should have checked with him before booking, but the situation is a bit ambiguous. The main conflict is his refusal to engage constructively and his dismissal of her viewpoint. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she aimed to accommodate and tried to understand, while he didn't accept the compromise and shut down the conversation.\n"
