  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman who scheduled a massage for herself and her boyfriend. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. When she tells him, he gets upset and says he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're just therapeutic and tries to discuss it, but he gets defensive, says she's arguing just to argue, and even offers to cancel his appointment. The author ends up going alone.\n\nThe question is whether she's at fault. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the author made a decision without consulting her boyfriend, even though they planned to get massages together. Maybe she assumed it was okay because they were doing it together, but personal boundaries about massage preferences can be important. She might have overlooked his comfort level. Then, when he expressed discomfort, she tried to reason with him, which he interpreted as arguing. He felt she was pushing her opinion and not respecting his feelings. She offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. He's not happy with the situation, and she went ahead without him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to make a fair split (male and female masseuses) and she was open to switching. She tried to understand his reasoning, even though he found her approach contentious. Maybe she didn't realize how sensitive he is about this. But she did take his preference into account after he expressed it, which shows she's willing to accommodate. However, she initially made the decision without checking with him, which could be the issue. In relationships, involving each other in decisions, especially those that affect both people, is usually important. If she had asked first, maybe this conflict could have been avoided.\n\nSo, the key points are: pre-booking without discussion, trying to understand but being seen as confrontational, and then the boyfriend's strong reaction. The author's actions might be seen as not respecting his boundaries by making the decision without consulting him, even if her intention was neutral. But once she heard his discomfort, she tried to adjust. The boyfriend's stance is that massages are inherently sexual, which is a personal belief, but it's his right to have that view. The author's mistake was not checking with him before booking, leading to an uncomfortable situation. Therefore, maybe she is at fault for not involving him in the decision-making process initially. So, answer A.\n"
