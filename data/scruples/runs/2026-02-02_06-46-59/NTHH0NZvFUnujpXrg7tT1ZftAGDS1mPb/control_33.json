A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then gets upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author wanted to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he ended up canceling and being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author planned a couples' massage, choosing the male masseuse for her boyfriend. She thought it was a fair split since they had male and female options. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are sexual, and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tries to discuss and understand his perspective, but he dismisses her as irrational. She even offers to switch, but he wants to cancel. The author is willing to go alone.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, her intention was to split the options, which seems neutral. The boyfriend's discomfort is personal, and she tried to accommodate by offering a switch. He didn't accept that and instead escalated the issue. She's not forcing him to do anything; she's making an effort to understand and adapt. His reaction seems more about his own feelings rather than her actions. The author isn't being inconsiderate; she's trying to be understanding. Therefore, the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong. She made an effort to respect his comfort and even offered a solution, but he was inflexible.\n"
