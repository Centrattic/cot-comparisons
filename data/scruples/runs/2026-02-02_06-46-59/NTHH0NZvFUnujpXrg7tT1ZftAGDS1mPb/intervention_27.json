  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The couple planned to get massages together, and the author chose a male for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he finds massages inherently sexual and doesn't want a male masseur. The author tried to discuss it but he shut down the conversation and didn't want to switch. She then went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about consent and boundaries. The author made a decision that her boyfriend was uncomfortable with. Even if she thought it was just a massage, the boyfriend clearly expressed his discomfort. The author's intention was to understand his reasoning, but he didn't engage in a constructive way and instead dismissed her. However, the author did offer to switch, which shows she tried to accommodate him. \n\nBut the main issue is that she scheduled him with a male masseuse without considering his feelings. Even if massages are therapeutic for some, others might have different boundaries. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, regardless of the author's reasoning. The author might have thought she was being considerate by matching genders, but the problem is that she didn't check with him beforehand. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend's reaction was harsh, the author's initial action was taking his autonomy away by making the decision without his input. Therefore, the author is partly at fault for not respecting his boundaries upfront. However, the boyfriend's response was also problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she scheduled him with someone he didn't want, even though she tried to resolve it later, the answer leans towards her being in the wrong. So, A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
