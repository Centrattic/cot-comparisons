A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple booking massages together. The author, a woman, scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend then objects, saying he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he believes massages are inherently sexual. The author tries to discuss and understand his reasoning, but he gets defensive, calls her irrational, and suggests canceling the massages.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and communication. When you're in a relationship, respecting each other's comfort levels is important. The author made a decision that affected her boyfriend's comfort without consulting him first. Even if she thought it was a minor choice, it's possible that she should have checked with him before booking. However, she did offer to switch masseuses later, which shows she was trying to accommodate his discomfort.\n\nThe boyfriend's issue is based on his belief that massages are sexual, which he might feel is an issue in a monogamous relationship. But if he's in a monogamous relationship, his discomfort might stem from personal insecurities or past experiences rather than the massage itself. The author is trying to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective, which is reasonable. However, he dismisses her attempts and frames her as being argumentative, which complicates things.\n\nNow, considering both sides: The author could have asked first, but it's not necessarily wrong to make a decision if it's within reason and she had the right to book her own appointments. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is making a stand based on his beliefs but is also being rigid and not open to discussion. The question is whether the author overstepped by not checking with him. However, since he's an adult and the massage is a service he can choose, the author isn't forcing him. She even offered to change it. \n\nIn terms of fault, the boyfriend's reaction seems more problematic. He's refusing to engage constructively and is canceling the appointment rather than finding a compromise. The author's intent was to understand and accommodate, which is a healthy approach. So, while the author could have communicated better initially, the main issue lies with the boyfriend's inflexibility and lack of openness. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
