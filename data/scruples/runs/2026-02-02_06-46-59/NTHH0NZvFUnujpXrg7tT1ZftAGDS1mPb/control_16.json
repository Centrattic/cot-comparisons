  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about scheduling a massage for the boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author is a woman who booked a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who is male. Then the boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual, so he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning. They argue, he says she's being irrational, and he refuses to switch, leading her to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's action was to schedule her boyfriend with a male masseuse. She might have thought it's okay since she's choosing based on availability, maybe to split the male and female masseuses between them. But the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he sees massages as sexual. That's a personal feeling, maybe related to body comfort or cultural beliefs.\n\nThe author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, which seems like a reasonable approach. She even offered to switch, but he refused. The key here is whether her initial decision was wrong. Choosing a masseuse for someone else, especially a partner, could be seen as overstepping if they have specific preferences. But the boyfriend didn't mention this preference before she booked it. Maybe he didn't think about it, or maybe he had a right to his comfort level.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that massages are inherently sexual is subjective. If he's uncomfortable, his preference should be respected. The author's insistence on understanding his reasoning and offering to switch shows she's trying to resolve it. However, the boyfriend's refusal might mean he's not open to compromise, which could be his issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a choice without knowing his preference. It's possible that the boyfriend should have communicated his comfort level earlier. But once the author realized his discomfort, she did try to accommodate. The conflict arises from differing views on the nature of massages. The author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to understand, but maybe the initial booking was a mistake because she didn't consider his possible discomfort. However, since she offered to switch and he still refused, maybe the blame isn't entirely on her.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and insistence that she's wrong might make him the one in the wrong here. The author's actions were based on her belief in the therapeutic nature, but when faced with the boyfriend's discomfort, she tried to adjust. So the answer might hinge on whether the initial action was wrong, or if the boyfriend's refusal to compromise is the issue. \n\nIn summary, the author tried to be understanding and offered solutions, but the boyfriend's rigid stance is problematic. However, the initial decision to book without considering his preference might be a minor fault. But since she tried to fix it, maybe she's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because she made an effort to accommodate his discomfort after the fact.\n"
