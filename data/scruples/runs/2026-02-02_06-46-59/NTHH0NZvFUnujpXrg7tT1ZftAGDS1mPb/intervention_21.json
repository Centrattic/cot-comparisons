  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling massages: the author booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and refuses to have a male masseuse. He's even unwilling to switch, leading the author to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to split the massages based on available options, maybe to mirror the genders for some reason (though the reasoning isn't clear). She wanted to understand his reasoning and even offered to change. The boyfriend, however, feels that massages have sexual undertones and is uncomfortable with a male masseuse. His reaction seems strong, and he's not open to compromise beyond canceling, which he ends up doing.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect for boundaries. The boyfriend has the right to his comfort level, and the author's initial decision might have overlooked his feelings. Even though she tried to discuss and offered solutions, he felt it was an argument and refused. The author's persistence in explaining and debating might have added pressure, even if her intention was to understand.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, which shows she was trying to respect his comfort. But the boyfriend's refusal to adjust and his dismissal of her perspective (calling her opinion irrational) might indicate that he's not open to dialogue. However, the fact that he's in a monogamous relationship and still feels massages are inherently sexual is a bit confusing because if he's comfortable with his partner, maybe others being of the opposite sex isn't an issue. But that's his personal belief.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether she overstepped by scheduling him with a male masseuse without considering his explicit discomfort. Even if she thought it was therapeutic, his boundary was violated. The fact that she tried to resolve it by offering a switch shows she wasn't malicious, but the initial act might still be seen as disregarding his feelings. So, while she didn't have bad intentions, her action could be seen as inconsiderate. However, since she made an effort to fix the situation, maybe she isn't entirely at fault. But the problem was starting without considering his preferences. The boyfriend's reaction is also extreme, but the author's initial decision is where the issue began. So, perhaps she's partially at fault.\n"
