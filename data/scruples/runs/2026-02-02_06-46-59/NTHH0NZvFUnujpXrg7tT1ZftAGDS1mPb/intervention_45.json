A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a massage for her boyfriend with a male masseuse. She chose him because there were options for male and female, and she went with the opposite gender for each. The boyfriend then says he won't go with a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tries to understand his reasoning but he accuses her of being irrational and making it an argument. She offers to switch, but he says to cancel and she goes anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a choice based on available options, thinking it's a standard service. The boyfriend has a personal boundary about male masseuses. She tried to discuss it, but he shut down the conversation and was dismissive. She offered a solution (switching), which he refused, leading her to proceed without him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she made a choice that the boyfriend was uncomfortable with. But she did try to accommodate by offering to switch. He, on the other hand, didn't communicate his discomfort beforehand. Maybe she should have asked first, but she didn't know about his feelings initially. However, once she found out, she tried to adjust. He refused to compromise and even canceled, which might be his choice. The author's actions were based on her own perspective, but she's now facing criticism for something she didn't know about. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say she should have checked in with him before booking, others might say his reaction is over the top. But since she tried to resolve it and he refused, maybe the blame isn't entirely on her. Alternatively, she could be seen as not respecting his boundaries once she was aware. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. The initial choice wasn't malicious, but after his reaction, she offered to switch. His refusal might be his issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
