A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a massage for the boyfriend with a male masseuse, and the boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to book the massages together, choosing based on the available options. They might have thought it's fair to assign each person a masseuse of the opposite sex since that's how the options were presented. But the boyfriend's discomfort is about the sexual nature of massages. Wait, but massages can be professional and non-sexual, right? So the author might be under the impression that it's just a therapeutic service, not something sexual. The boyfriend, however, feels it's inappropriate for him to have a male masseuse, maybe due to personal boundaries or beliefs. \n\nThe author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, which shows she's trying to be considerate. She even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The question is whether her initial decision was wrong. Well, she didn't know his boundaries beforehand. Unless there was prior discussion about this, she might not be at fault for assuming the standard practice. However, by not considering his possible discomfort, maybe she should have checked first. But since the service is typically non-sexual, she might not be wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal after the fact is causing conflict. He's making it about her pushing his boundaries, but she was trying to accommodate. The key here is whether the author had prior knowledge of his discomfort. If she didn't, she's not at fault. If she had known and ignored it, then yes. But the situation shows she didn't know and tried to resolve it. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She made a reasonable choice and tried to address his concerns. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own boundaries being crossed without prior knowledge, but she wasn't wrong in her initial decision.\n"
