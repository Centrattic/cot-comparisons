A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. There were two options: a male and female masseuse. She booked the boyfriend with the male and herself with the female. When she told him, he got upset, saying he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She argues they're therapeutic, tries to discuss his logic, but he says she's wrong and that it's an argument. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She still went without him. The question is if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are communication, respect for boundaries, and mutual understanding. The author made a decision that her boyfriend found uncomfortable. Even though she thought it was reasonable (since she wanted to split the genders), he had a strong objection. She tried to discuss and understand his perspective, which is good. But when he refused and wanted to cancel, she went ahead without him. \n\nIs she wrong for making that choice? Well, she considered his feelings by offering to switch, but he didn't want that. So she honored her own choice but respected his refusal. However, maybe she should have checked with him before booking? But the situation says they planned to get massages together, so maybe the plan was to split the masseuses. But maybe the problem is that she didn't consider his comfort level first. However, she did offer to switch, which shows she tried to accommodate. \n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that she didn't take his discomfort seriously enough. But he also seems to be making a firm stance. The author's actions were to go ahead even after he wanted to cancel. That could be seen as not respecting his feelings, but since he canceled his own appointment, she went without him. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe she isn't because she tried to discuss and offer alternatives. But maybe she should have communicated better beforehand. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong now. Since she followed up, offered a switch, and he still refused, perhaps she did what she could. So answer B (No) she isn't in the wrong.\n"
