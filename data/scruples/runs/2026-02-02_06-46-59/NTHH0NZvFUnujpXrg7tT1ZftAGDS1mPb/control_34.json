  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (a female) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. They had planned to get massages together, and she chose based on availability. The boyfriend then refused because he found it sexual, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that she wanted to be fair and split the masseuses by gender. She tried to understand his discomfort and even offered to switch. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels that massages are inherently sexual and is upset that she insisted on her choice, making it an argument.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respect and communication. The author tried to explain her reasoning and asked for his perspective, which shows she's trying to be considerate. She even offered to change the booking, which is a gesture of compromise. However, the boyfriend's refusal and dismissal of her attempts to understand his view might be problematic. He accuses her of making it up to argue, which could indicate defensiveness rather than openness.\n\nThe author's actions don't seem malicious. She made a decision based on available options and wanted to share the experience equally. Her desire to understand his reasoning is healthy in a relationship\u2014discussing differences is part of maintaining a good partnership. The boyfriend's reaction, however, shuts down communication by calling her irrational and refusing to engage further. His insistence on canceling the appointment might be more about his own discomfort than her actions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't forcing him to go through with the male masseuse after he expresses discomfort. She offers to switch, showing she's willing to adjust. The boyfriend's decision to cancel is his own choice, and the author is willing to go alone, which is his loss but not her fault. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She acted respectfully and tried to accommodate his feelings. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
