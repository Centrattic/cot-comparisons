A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with it, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning, but he got defensive and refused to switch. She went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to plan a shared experience, maybe to have a nice time together. She chose based on the available options, perhaps assuming the gender wouldn't matter. But her boyfriend has a strong objection. He believes that massages have a sexual connotation, which makes him uncomfortable. Since he's the one receiving the massage, his comfort is important. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author tried to discuss it, which is good. She even offered to switch, but he still refused. He might feel that his boundaries are not being respected. Even though she didn't mean to push him, her initial action might have disregarded his feelings. However, she didn't force him; she offered an option. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme. If he's uncomfortable with any opposite-sex masseuse, why get a massage at all in a monogamous relationship? Maybe he has personal boundaries or past experiences that make him uncomfortable. It's valid for him to have that, but his response was to cancel rather than find a compromise. \n\nThe author's persistence to understand might have come off as arguing, leading to tension. Still, she wasn't forcing him. The final decision to cancel was his choice. So, who's at fault here?\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong. She tried to accommodate and understand. The boyfriend, however, didn't communicate his discomfort clearly and refused to even switch, which could be seen as not being open to compromise. But maybe she should have considered his previous feelings about opposite-sex interactions more carefully. However, since she offered to switch and he still declined, it's more about his own boundaries. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
