A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse when he objects. The boyfriend says that massages are inherently sexual, which makes him uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning, but he didn't want to switch and suggested canceling the massage. The author went ahead without him.\n\nSo, the user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseus, citing that massages are sexual. That's his personal discomfort. The author tried to discuss and even offered to switch. He refused and wanted to cancel. She went ahead anyway. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she respected his initial preference by assigning him a male masseus, but when he changed his mind, she tried to accommodate. He didn't want to switch, so she proceeded. The key point is whether she overstepped by scheduling him with a male masseuse initially, knowing he might be uncomfortable. But wait, she didn't know until after she scheduled them. She assumed he'd be okay with a male masseuse. If she had known beforehand, maybe she wouldn't have done that. However, since he later objected, she tried to adjust. But he didn't want to switch, so she went without him. \n\nIs her initial action wrong? It's possible she didn't know his discomfort. But maybe she should have asked first. But the situation says they both planned to get massages together, and the author made the booking. The boyfriend's objection came after the fact. The author tried to resolve it by offering to switch, but he refused. She then went alone. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about respecting boundaries. The boyfriend had a valid discomfort, and the author didn't check his preference before booking. But she tried to adjust once she knew. However, by not checking first, she might have disregarded his feelings. But the boyfriend also refused to switch and canceled. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she made an effort to accommodate after his objection. \n\nAlternatively, if she had scheduled him with a male masseuse without checking if that's his preference, she might be at fault. But the initial scheduling was based on availability and the assumption that he'd be okay. The boyfriend's reaction is his issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that she should have asked his preference before booking. That's a reasonable point. However, in the scenario, she didn't know he had that preference. So she can't be blamed for not knowing. Once she learned, she tried to adjust. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his insistence on canceling is his choice. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She made an effort to understand and accommodate, and the boyfriend's stance is his personal issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
