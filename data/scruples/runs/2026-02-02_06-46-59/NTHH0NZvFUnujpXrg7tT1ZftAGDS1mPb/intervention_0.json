  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They both wanted massages. The author chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend and the female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss it, he said she was wrong, she offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. Now she's going without him. She's asking if she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made a decision without considering her boyfriend's comfort. Even though she tried to explain her reasoning, he felt it was inappropriate. The boyfriend's objection is based on his belief that massages have a sexual connotation, which he's not comfortable with. She tried to engage in a discussion, but he shut it down. He even offered to cancel instead of using the male masseuse. \n\nNow, in relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the boyfriend clearly states he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, then the author should have respected that. Even if she thinks her reasoning is logical, pushing her choice when it makes him uncomfortable might be crossing a line. The fact that he's in a monogamous relationship but still feels massages are sexual might be his personal discomfort, not necessarily a wrong belief. \n\nThe author's main mistake was not checking with her boyfriend first. She assumed her choice was neutral, but he had a strong objection. Even though she tried to switch later, he was already upset. The boyfriend's main issue is that he feels she's pushing something uncomfortable on him, which he sees as inappropriate. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't prioritize her partner's comfort. However, it's a bit nuanced. The boyfriend's reasoning is subjective, but in a relationship, respecting each other's feelings is key. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider his comfort level and insisted on her choice despite his clear discomfort.\n"
