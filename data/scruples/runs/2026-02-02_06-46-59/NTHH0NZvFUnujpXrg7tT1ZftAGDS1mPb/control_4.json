  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse when he later objects.\n\nFirst, when they planned the massages, the author chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend, probably assuming it's fine. But the boyfriend got upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and suggested canceling.\n\nNow, the key points here. The boyfriend's discomfort is about his perception of massages being sexual. The author, in contrast, sees massages as therapeutic. He's arguing that getting a massage from someone of the opposite sex is okay, but same-sex might be an issue because they're in a monogamous relationship. The boyfriend claims her argument is irrational and she's making it up to argue. The author kept trying to discuss it, which he saw as an argument, leading to him canceling.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't know his feelings beforehand. She made a choice based on availability, which seems reasonable. When he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate by offering a switch. He refused and then canceled. The author isn't forcing him; she's willing to adjust. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his personal boundaries. Unless the author had prior knowledge of his discomfort, which she didn't, she's not at fault. The boyfriend is within his rights to have boundaries, but the author isn't in the wrong for making an initial choice and trying to resolve the issue.\n"
