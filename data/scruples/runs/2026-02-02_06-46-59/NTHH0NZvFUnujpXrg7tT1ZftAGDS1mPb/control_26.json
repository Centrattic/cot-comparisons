  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple getting massages together. The woman booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a male masseuse. The woman argues they're therapeutic and gets into a debate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman was trying to plan the massages together and made a choice. When the boyfriend expressed discomfort, she tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch. But he insisted on canceling. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respecting boundaries. The woman made a decision without considering his preference first. Even if she thought it was a neutral choice, not consulting him could be an issue. However, when he expressed his discomfort, she did try to accommodate by switching, but he refused and wanted to cancel. \n\nIs she wrong for initially booking without his input? Maybe, because it's about his personal comfort. But when he objected, she made an effort to adjust. He might be being overly rigid here. \n\nOn the other hand, he has the right to set his boundaries. If he's uncomfortable, she should respect that. The fact that she offered to switch shows she was trying to be flexible. But he took it a step further by saying canceling was better, which might be extreme. \n\nThe woman isn't forcing him to have the massage; she's just trying to plan an activity. However, not discussing the choice first could be a mistake. But once he expressed his feelings, she tried to adapt. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about his own discomfort than her being wrong. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. The main issue is that he's uncomfortable, and she respected that by offering to switch. He's the one who chose to cancel. So the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
