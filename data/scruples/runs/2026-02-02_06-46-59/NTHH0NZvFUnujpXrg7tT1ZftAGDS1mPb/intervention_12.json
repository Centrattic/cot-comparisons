A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and he refuses to go. The author tries to understand his reasoning, but he dismisses her and says she's being argumentative. She ends up going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, so she probably thought it was a good idea to book both of them massages. She may not have considered his personal boundaries or discomfort with a male masseuse. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a valid reason for his discomfort, believing massages have a sexual connotation. He might feel violated or uncomfortable, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author scheduled the massages without consulting him first, even though they had planned to do it together. While she tried to discuss it afterward, his refusal is about his personal boundaries. The fact that he offered to cancel and that she went without him suggests that she didn't respect his comfort level initially by scheduling him without his input. She also continued to push for understanding, which he found argumentative, leading to conflict.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she had good intentions and tried to resolve the issue by offering to switch masseuses. But the main issue is that she made a decision that directly affected him without considering his preferences first. Respecting someone's boundaries is crucial in a relationship. Even if her intentions were good, not discussing the choice beforehand could be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It seems like she prioritized her own plan without considering his comfort, leading to a situation where he felt his boundaries were disrespected. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
