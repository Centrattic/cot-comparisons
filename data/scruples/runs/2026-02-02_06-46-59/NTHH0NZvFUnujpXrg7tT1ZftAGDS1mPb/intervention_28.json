  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a woman, booked her boyfriend (who is male) with a male masseuse during a joint massage appointment. The boyfriend was uncomfortable with that and said massages are inherently sexual, so he didn't want a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss it and understand his reasoning, but he ended up being upset and even suggested canceling instead of switching masseuses. The author now is asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning was that massages are therapeutic, so she just wanted to split the masseuses by gender. But the boyfriend felt that massages have a sexual connotation, making him uncomfortable. He even said he wouldn't accept a male masseuse in a monogamous relationship, which seems contradictory if he's okay with female masseuses. The author tried to engage in a discussion to understand his perspective and even offered to switch, but he became upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and comfort. The author made a decision without consulting her boyfriend, which might have overlooked his personal boundaries. Even though she later offered to switch, the initial action of booking without checking in with him first could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning about massages being inherently sexual seems a bit unclear. If he's okay with a female masseuse, maybe his discomfort is more about personal preference rather than a universal belief. But he's entitled to his comfort level.\n\nThe author's intention was to understand and adjust, but the boyfriend's reaction was to escalate the situation by suggesting cancellation. However, the main question is whether the author is at fault. By making a decision without considering his comfort first, she might have overstepped. Even if her intention was good, respecting his boundaries from the start would have been better. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not checking with him before booking. Alternatively, the boyfriend's reasoning could be flawed, but his discomfort is valid regardless. \n\nSo, balancing both perspectives, the author's action of scheduling without his input might be the issue. Even if she offered to change plans later, the initial choice was hers. Therefore, she could be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries upfront.\n"
