  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse while the author takes the female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and won't accept a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are about consent and understanding boundaries. The author made a choice based on available options, assuming the massage was therapeutic. The boyfriend has a different perspective, seeing massages as sexual. The author tried to engage in a discussion and even offered a solution, but the boyfriend wouldn't budge.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's comfort levels. The author might not have considered the boyfriend's feelings beforehand. However, the author's intention wasn't to make an issue but to understand. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author did make an effort to resolve it. \n\nThe question is whether scheduling the male masseuse was wrong. Since the author didn't know about the boyfriend's discomfort beforehand, maybe they are not at fault. But if the boyfriend expressed discomfort before, then it's a different story. However, in this case, the author didn't know, and after the fact, tried to address it. So the author isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic, but the initial action of the author isn't malicious. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
