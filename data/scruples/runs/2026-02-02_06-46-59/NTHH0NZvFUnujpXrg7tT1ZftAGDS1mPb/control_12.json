  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse, but the boyfriend is uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning, but he says she's being irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author made a choice based on their own understanding of massages being non-sexual. They might have thought it was a practical decision, like splitting the genders. But the boyfriend is clearly uncomfortable, which can be valid too. His discomfort could stem from personal boundaries or past experiences. The author tried to explain and even offered to switch, which shows they tried to accommodate. But when he refused and wanted to cancel, she decided to go without him. \n\nIs the author wrong for initially scheduling the male masseuse? Well, she might not have known his feelings beforehand. But after he expressed discomfort, she tried to resolve it. The key here is whether she respected his boundaries. She did offer a compromise, so maybe she's not in the wrong. On the flip side, he might feel that she didn't consider his feelings initially. However, since she adjusted her plan once she knew his issue, it's more about him not wanting to engage further. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme in a way. If he's uncomfortable with any opposite-sex masseuse in a monogamous relationship, maybe his reasoning isn't consistent, as he's okay with his partner being massaged by a woman. The author is trying to understand his logic, which is reasonable. His dismissal of her as irrational and refusing to engage further might be his own issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author tried to find a solution after realizing his discomfort. She didn't force him to go through with it. The boyfriend's refusal to adjust beyond that point might make him the one being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
