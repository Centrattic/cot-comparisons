A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse.\n\nFirst, the situation: They both planned to get massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't accept a male masseuse. The author tries to discuss it, but he says she's being irrational and wants to cancel his massage. She goes anyway without him.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about respecting boundaries versus the author's actions. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he views massages as sexual. The author thinks it's therapeutic and wants to understand his reasoning. She even offers to switch, but he refuses and wants to cancel.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let me think about the key points. The boyfriend's comfort is important. If he's genuinely uncomfortable, the author should respect that. But she tried to understand his reasoning and offered a solution (switching masseuses), which he rejected. Maybe she's not wrong because she tried to accommodate him. However, he might feel she's ignoring his feelings by not just switching without pushing the debate.\n\nWait, but she did offer to switch, which he said too much trouble. So maybe he's being inflexible. The author isn't forcing him to get a massage; she's going without him. So she's not making him do anything. The problem is whether her initial decision was wrong. But she had no way of knowing his preference beforehand. It's common to book appointments without knowing someone's specific preferences unless stated. So maybe she's not in the wrong for making the initial choice. She tried to adjust, but he refused. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have discussed it first. But since they were booking together, maybe she assumed it's okay. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme because massages can be non-sexual. His reasoning might be based on a personal belief, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not accepting that. \n\nIn terms of AITA, usually, if someone respects another's boundaries after they're expressed, they're not at fault. The author tried to adjust. However, if the boyfriend had made his preferences clear earlier, maybe she would have acted differently. But since she didn't know, she's not wrong. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
