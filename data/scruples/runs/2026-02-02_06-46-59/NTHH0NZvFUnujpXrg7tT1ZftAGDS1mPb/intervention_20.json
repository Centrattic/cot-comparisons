A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who scheduled their boyfriend with a male masseuse is in the wrong. The situation is that they wanted to get massages together, and the user chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend is now upset, saying that massages are inherently sexual, and he won't let a man do it. The user tried to discuss it but the boyfriend accused her of making it up to argue. They offered to switch, but he wants to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user's action was based on practical reasons\u2014availability and maybe fairness, since they both got massages. The boyfriend's discomfort is about his personal boundaries regarding gender and sexuality. Massages can be a sensitive topic because they involve close physical contact, which some might find uncomfortable if not in a romantic context.\n\nThe user tried to understand his reasoning, which is good. However, the boyfriend felt the discussion was argumentative. The key here is whether the user overstepped by assigning a male masseuse without considering his explicit preference. Even if the user didn't know beforehand, once the boyfriend expressed discomfort, she offered to switch. But he refused and wanted to cancel.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The user might have assumed that the booking was just about availability, but the boyfriend's issue is about personal comfort. The user's initial decision might not be wrong, but perhaps she didn't check in with him about his preferences beforehand. However, since she did offer to switch after he expressed discomfort, maybe she tried to resolve it.\n\nBut the boyfriend's stance is that massages are inherently sexual, which could be his personal belief. The user is pushing to understand, which is valid, but he's not open to discussion. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for the initial booking or if the boyfriend is being unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of accountability, sometimes in relationships, people have different comfort levels. The user might not be in the wrong if she didn't know his preference, but once he stated it, she tried to accommodate. However, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and wanting to cancel could be his own issue. The user's persistence in wanting to go through with it might be seen as not respecting his boundary, but she did offer to switch.\n\nSo, considering that the user tried to resolve it, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. But if the boyfriend had previously mentioned discomfort with male masseuses and she ignored it, that's different. Since the scenario doesn't say he mentioned it before, the initial booking might not be her fault. However, the fact that he felt it was inherently sexual and that the user didn't consider that before booking could tip the scale. So maybe the answer is A, she is in the wrong for not considering his feelings from the start, even if she tried to resolve it afterward.\n"
