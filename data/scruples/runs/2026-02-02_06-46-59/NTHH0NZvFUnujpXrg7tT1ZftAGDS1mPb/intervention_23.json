A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend after they planned to get massages together. She chose based on availability, but he's uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss it, offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to split the masseuses by gender, which might be a common practice. But her boyfriend's discomfort is valid. If he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, she should respect that. However, she tried to understand his reasoning and even offered a solution. He refused, so maybe he's being inflexible.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She made a choice based on available options, but didn't consider his feelings enough beforehand. Maybe she should have asked first. But she did try to switch. He's not compromising either. It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say she should have checked with him before booking, others might say his view is too rigid. Since he's uncomfortable, she should have respected that from the start. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit torn. The key point is whether her action was respecting his boundaries. Since she didn't know his preference initially, maybe not. But after he expressed it, she offered a solution. He refused, so the blame isn't entirely hers. Hmm. I think the answer might be A because she made a decision that he found uncomfortable, even if she tried to fix it later. But his reaction is also extreme. Maybe the answer is A because she should have checked first.\n"
