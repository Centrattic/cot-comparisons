A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse while the author got a female one. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a man massaging him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he insisted on canceling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author made a decision based on available options (male and female masseuses) and assigned each a gender. The boyfriend's objection is about the perceived sexual nature of massages. The author's intention was to understand, not necessarily to force the issue. But he felt she was making it an argument. \n\nNow, considering AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the main factors are respect for boundaries and communication. The boyfriend clearly stated his discomfort, and the author tried to discuss it. However, when he insisted on canceling, she went ahead without him. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, she made a choice without considering his explicit boundary. On the other, she tried to reason and even offered a compromise. But the boyfriend's stance is a personal boundary, and the author's insistence on debating might have been seen as dismissive. \n\nIn AITA contexts, respecting someone's personal boundaries is crucial. Even if the author saw it as a therapeutic choice, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid. The fact that he asked to cancel and she proceeded alone might be seen as her being inconsiderate. However, she did attempt to accommodate and switch. But maybe the initial decision was the issue. So the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't respect his boundary upfront. But I should check if there's a cultural or personal aspect I'm missing. Also, the boyfriend's reasoning about massages being sexual is questionable, but his right to have that feeling is what matters here. The author's approach might have been more argumentative than empathetic, leading to the conflict. I think the consensus is AITA for the author.\n"
