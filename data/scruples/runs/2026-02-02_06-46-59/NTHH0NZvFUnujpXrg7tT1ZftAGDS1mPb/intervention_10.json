  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're purely therapeutic and wants to understand his reasoning, but he's not open to discussion and wants to cancel. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a choice based on availability, assigning a male masseuse to her boyfriend. She might not have considered his comfort level, which could be a point against her. On the other hand, he might be overreacting if there's no valid reason for his discomfort. But the key here is consent and respecting boundaries. The boyfriend clearly states he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, especially if he's in a monogamous relationship and has concerns about massages being sexual. The author tried to switch, which shows she was willing to accommodate, but he refused to adjust. \n\nThe author is trying to understand his reasoning, but he's dismissing her and calling her irrational. However, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by not considering his preferences beforehand. Even if her intention was neutral, not asking him beforehand could be seen as inconsiderate. But massages are personal; people have different comfort levels. If he's adamant about not having a male masseuse, then the author should have respected that. She did offer to switch, but he didn't accept. So maybe the issue is that she didn't check in with him before booking. But he also might have an irrational fear. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is about respect and communication. The author didn't ask first, which could be a mistake. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also extreme. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she took action without considering his feelings, even if she tried to fix it, she might share some blame. The boyfriend's response is also problematic, but the initial decision to book him with a male masseuse without checking in with him could be seen as the author's fault. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
