  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a massage for their boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he gets upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he ended up canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend, thinking massages are therapeutic. He's uncomfortable because he feels massages are sexual. The key points are about respecting each other's boundaries and communication. \n\nThe author tried to discuss and understand his reasons, which shows effort to resolve the issue. However, he dismissed her arguments and refused to budge. The question is whether the author's initial decision was wrong. \n\nMassages can be seen as either therapeutic or sexual depending on individual perceptions. It's important to respect personal comfort levels. The author might not have realized the significance of his discomfort beforehand. But she did offer to switch, which was a good move. However, he still canceled, maybe overreacting. \n\nIs the author at fault for making a choice without knowing his preference? Maybe not, but she could have asked his preference first. On the other hand, he might be overgeneralizing massages as sexual. The author's intention was to be equal, but his discomfort is valid. \n\nSo, considering that she tried to accommodate and he was unwilling to compromise beyond that, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, she could have checked his preference before booking. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether her action was respectful of his boundaries. Since she offered to switch, perhaps she isn't at fault. But some might argue that she should have asked first. Hmm. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she made an effort to adjust and he was resistant.\n"
