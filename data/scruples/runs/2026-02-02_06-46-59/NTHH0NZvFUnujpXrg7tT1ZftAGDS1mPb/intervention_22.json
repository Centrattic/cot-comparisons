  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a disagreement about the nature of massages\u2014whether they're therapeutic or inherently sexual. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The author made a choice based on the availability of male and female masseuses, assigning each partner to the opposite gender. The boyfriend then objects, stating massages are sexual. The author tries to understand his reasoning and even offers to switch, but he insists on canceling.\n\nNow, considering consent and comfort. The boyfriend clearly expressed discomfort with a male masseuse. Even if the author thinks massages are therapeutic, respecting his boundaries is key. She might have assumed that since they're in a relationship, he's okay with opposite-sex interactions, but that's not necessarily the case. The boyfriend's comfort is his own to decide.\n\nThe author's intention was to facilitate the activity they planned, but she didn't consider his discomfort beforehand. She tried to discuss and compromise, but the conflict arose because he wasn't comfortable with the arrangement. While she offered to switch, he still refused, leading to cancellation. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. Even if the author believes massages are non-sexual, the boyfriend's perspective matters. The author might not be \"wrong\" in her belief, but she did overlook his feelings initially. However, she made an effort to resolve the issue. The key point is whether she should have considered his potential discomfort before booking. \n\nGiven that the boyfriend had a clear reason based on his perception of massages as sexual, the author's action wasn't malicious but could have been more considerate. The main question is whether respecting his decision to cancel is necessary, even if it was the author's idea. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author overstepped by not considering his potential discomfort. Since she did make an effort afterward, but the initial decision was based on availability without checking his comfort, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in terms of being in the wrong, it might lean towards her not being in the wrong because she tried to address it. But some might argue she should have asked first. \n\nBut the boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and maybe the author should have checked in before booking. However, the situation is complicated by the boyfriend's rigid stance and unwillingness to compromise after the fact. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's intent was good, and she tried to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's refusal could be his own issue. But others might see her as not considering his feelings. It's a tough call, but leaning towards B.\n"
