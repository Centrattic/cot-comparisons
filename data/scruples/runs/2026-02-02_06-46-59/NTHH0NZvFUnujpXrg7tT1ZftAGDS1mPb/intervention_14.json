A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a woman, scheduled her boyfriend, who's a man, with a male masseuse during their joint massage plans. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are purely therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning. But he got upset and eventually wanted to cancel. Now the author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted to make a choice that seemed reasonable to her\u2014maybe she thought splitting the masseuses by gender was normal or just a way to avoid awkwardness. But the boyfriend's discomfort is real. If he's not comfortable with a male masseuse, then the author's choice could be causing him stress. Even though she tried to explain her reasoning and offered to switch, he didn't accept and instead wanted to cancel. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. When making decisions that involve a partner, especially in a shared activity, considering their feelings is important. The author might have thought she was being reasonable by splitting the masseuses based on gender, but not everyone has the same comfort level. Her boyfriend's discomfort isn't just about the massage being sexual\u2014it's about his personal boundaries. \n\nThe author tried to debate the issue, which might have made the situation more contentious than necessary. Instead of trying to convince him of her viewpoint, maybe she should have prioritized his comfort first. Even though she offered to switch, he still wanted to cancel, so her initial decision might have overlooked his needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction could be seen as extreme, but his discomfort is valid. If he's truly uncomfortable, it's his right to not proceed. The author's intention wasn't to make him uncomfortable, but the outcome still affected him negatively. \n\nSo, considering that the author made a decision that impacted her partner's comfort without fully respecting his initial refusal, even after he expressed his concerns, she might be in the wrong. The boyfriend's refusal isn't about the massage itself but his personal boundaries. The author's insistence on understanding his reasoning turned it into an argument, which could have been avoided by backing down when he expressed discomfort.\n"
