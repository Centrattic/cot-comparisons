A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. They both planned to get massages together, and she chose the male for him and female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he insists on canceling.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about mutual respect and boundaries. The boyfriend feels that having a male masseuse is a dealbreaker for him, and he's clear about his discomfort. The author, while wanting to understand his perspective, might not be considering that his discomfort is significant enough that he's unwilling to proceed with the male masseuse at all. Even offering to switch, which she does, he still says to cancel. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on if she should have respected his boundary without pushing. She might argue she was just trying to be fair, but if he's adamantly against it, continuing to insist on the initial arrangement could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. The boyfriend's statement that he'll never let a man massage him and that it's inherently sexual suggests a personal or cultural belief that's important to him. The author's insistence on a debate might come across as not taking his discomfort seriously, leading to the argument. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author respect his boundary? She did offer to switch, but he still wants to cancel. Maybe she overstepped by not considering his feelings upfront. Also, turning it into a debate might have made him feel his opinion was being challenged, rather than accepted. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't respect his preference and pushed for a discussion when he was already uncomfortable. But others might say B (No) because she tried to accommodate and the issue was his own discomfort. However, the fact that he's so adamant about canceling despite her offers makes me lean towards A.\n"
