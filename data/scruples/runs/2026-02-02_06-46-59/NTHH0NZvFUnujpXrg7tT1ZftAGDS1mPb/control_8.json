A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman who booked massages for her boyfriend and herself. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. Her boyfriend, when informed, refuses to go with a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are just therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning. He gets defensive, says she's being argumentative, and refuses to switch. She ends up going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her action of booking a male masseuse was wrong. She made a choice based on availability, maybe assuming it's okay. But her boyfriend has a strong objection. The key points here: she tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he wouldn't budge. So, was she wrong to book the male masseuse initially?\n\nWell, the main question is about mutual respect in a relationship. She wanted to plan something together, but there was a mismatch in comfort levels. She might not be wrong for trying to plan something, but she might not have considered his potential discomfort upfront. However, she did offer to switch, which shows she tried to accommodate his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that she didn't consider his preferences initially. But she had no way of knowing unless he communicated it. He's now making a big deal about it, and she's trying to talk it out. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she had asked him first, maybe she could have avoided the issue. But she acted on her own in a situation where she thought she was making a reasonable choice. She didn't force him; she offered alternatives. \n\nSo, maybe she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, and he's not engaging constructively. The author's actions were well-intentioned, and she tried to resolve the conflict. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
