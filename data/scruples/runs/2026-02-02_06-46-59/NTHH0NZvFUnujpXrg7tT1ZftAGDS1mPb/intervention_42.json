A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author, a woman, booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend got upset, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss it, but he called her irrational and said she was making it up to argue. She even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did she overstep by choosing the masseuse without considering his comfort? Was the discussion about the nature of massages a valid reason for conflict?\n\nMassages can be personal, and people have different comfort levels. The author might have assumed it was fine, but the boyfriend clearly had issues. The fact that he felt strongly enough to cancel suggests that his discomfort is significant. The author tried to understand his reasoning, but he dismissed her attempts and escalated it. However, the initial action of booking him with a male masseuse without his input could be seen as not respecting his boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He's dismissing her perspective and ending the trip, which might indicate his own issues rather than her being wrong. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. She did make a choice without his input, which is a common issue in relationships. However, the main conflict comes from his interpretation of massages as sexual, which he has the right to hold. So maybe she isn't entirely wrong, but did she not consider his feelings enough?\n\nThe debate here is about mutual respect and communication. While she wanted to understand his reasons, he didn't accept her perspective. It's a bit of a two-way street. But the core issue is that she made a decision without his input, leading to his discomfort. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. \n\nIn the AITA style, the answer often depends on whose feelings were hurt. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, so the author might be in the wrong for not considering it upfront. Alternatively, the boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively might mean he's at fault. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's a nuance. However, since the question asks if she's in the wrong, and the main issue is her initial decision without his input, the answer might lean towards A (yes). But some might argue it's not her fault because she tried to resolve it. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. The key is whether the act of scheduling without discussion is a transgression. In many cases, respecting a partner's preferences is important. So maybe she is in the wrong for not checking first. Thus, answer A.\n"
