A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and the author planned to get massages together. The author chose the male masseuse for him and the female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning, even offering to switch. He refuses and suggests canceling his massage. The author proceeds without him.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are consent and respecting boundaries. The boyfriend's discomfort is about the gender of the masseuse. Even if the author's intention was neutral, if the boyfriend is uncomfortable, she should respect that. She offered to switch, which was a good step, but he still refused. However, she went ahead, which might be an issue because she didn't agree to his terms. But maybe she had a right to her own choice too. Wait, she scheduled him with a male masseuse without his input. That's the problem. She should have checked with him first instead of assuming his preference. So she didn't respect his autonomy in that decision. So yes, she's in the wrong because she made the choice without considering his feelings and boundaries. Even though she offered to switch later, the initial action was unilateral. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and the author should have involved him in the decision-making process. Therefore, answer A.\n"
