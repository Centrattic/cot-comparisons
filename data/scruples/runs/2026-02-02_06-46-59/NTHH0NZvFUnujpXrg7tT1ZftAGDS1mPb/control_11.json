A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple planned to get massages together. The author, a woman, booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. Her boyfriend is uncomfortable with a man giving him a massage, saying massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're therapeutic and tried to discuss his reasoning, but he got defensive, called her arguments irrational, and suggested canceling his appointment. She went anyway without him.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and respect. The boyfriend's discomfort is about his personal feelings regarding massages and gender. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he dismissed her efforts and made it about her being wrong. However, she did offer to switch, which he refused by saying to cancel. She then proceeded without him.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she made a decision based on her own logic (splitting by gender) without considering his specific preferences. But she did try to accommodate his feelings by offering to switch. He, on the other hand, didn't communicate his discomfort earlier and reacted negatively. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. The author might have assumed her choice was neutral, but it's possible she should have discussed the masseuse's gender with him beforehand. However, since he made it an issue after the fact, maybe the fault isn't entirely hers. The boyfriend's reaction seems more problematic\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6 dismissed her attempts to understand and made it an argument. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's action might not be entirely wrong because she tried to resolve it. The main issue is his reaction. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
