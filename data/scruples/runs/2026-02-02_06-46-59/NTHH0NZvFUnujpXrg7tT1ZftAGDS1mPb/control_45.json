A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're just therapeutic and wants to understand his reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's discomfort might be valid. If he feels that having a male masseuse is a problem because he associates massages with being sexual, then it's his right to feel that way. It's about personal boundaries and comfort. On the other hand, the author might be trying to be considerate by splitting the masseuses by gender, but maybe she didn't realize how much this would bother him.\n\nShe tried to have a discussion and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to find a solution. But he insisted on canceling, which seems extreme. But maybe his issue isn't just about the gender but deeper discomfort. The author is confused why he would get a massage from anyone if he thinks it's sexual in a monogamous relationship. That seems like a valid point for her to bring up, but maybe he's not comfortable discussing it further.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong for pushing through despite his discomfort. She did offer to switch, which he refused. If he's not comfortable at all, maybe she should have respected his decision from the start. But she was trying to understand and compromise. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe she's not entirely wrong, but perhaps she could have been more sensitive to his feelings upfront. However, since she tried to accommodate and he shut it down, maybe the blame isn't entirely on her. \n\nI think the key here is that she didn't force him to go through with it. She offered alternatives. So, she's probably not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
