A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The situation is about the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. She's a woman, he's a man. They planned to get massages together, and she chose a male for him and a female for herself. He's upset because he thinks massages are sexual, and he won't allow a man to massage him. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning. He gets frustrated, says she's arguing just to argue, and refuses to switch. She ends up going without him.\n\nFirst, the author's action: She scheduled him with a male masseuse. He's uncomfortable with that. So maybe her mistake was not checking with him first? But she did tell him after booking, right? She says she offered to switch. So maybe she didn't force him, but he was already upset. \n\nHe says massages are inherently sexual. That's his personal belief. She's trying to discuss it, but he's not being receptive. He's also not willing to compromise beyond canceling. The author is trying to understand, but he's not being open to dialogue. \n\nIs it wrong for her to schedule him with a male masseuse? Maybe not inherently, but if he's uncomfortable, is she respecting his feelings? She did offer to switch, but he refused. Maybe she should have known his preference beforehand. But she didn't know until after she booked. \n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and respect. If she had asked first, maybe she wouldn't have scheduled the male masseuse. But since she didn't, and then he was uncomfortable, maybe she's in the wrong for not considering his feelings. However, he's also being closed-minded and dismissive of her attempts to understand. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. The user thinks she's in the wrong. I need to decide. \n\nI think part of the issue is that she made the decision without checking with him first. Even though she offered to switch after the fact, the initial action was to book him without considering his possible discomfort. So she might have overstepped. On the other hand, he's also being rigid and not engaging in a constructive discussion. But the question is about her. If she's the one who scheduled it, and he's uncomfortable, then maybe she's in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries. Alternatively, if he didn't communicate his preference earlier, he's part of the problem. \n\nBut the author tried to understand, which is good. But maybe she should have been more aware of his possible discomfort. However, she didn't know. It's a bit of a gray area. But since she made the decision without his input, maybe she's at fault. So I think the answer is A.\n"
