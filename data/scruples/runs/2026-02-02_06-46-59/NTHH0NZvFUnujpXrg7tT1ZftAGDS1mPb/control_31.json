A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. She and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female for herself. He's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're therapeutic and tried to discuss his reasons. He says she's being argumentative, and when she offers to switch, he wants to cancel. She's going ahead without him.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, she made a choice based on available options. He has a personal boundary she didn't consider. But she tried to explain her reasoning and even offered to switch. He then refused and wanted to cancel. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, respecting each other's comfort is important. She might have assumed his comfort level without discussing it first. But she didn't force him; she offered to adjust. His reaction seems extreme. She's standing her ground, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo maybe the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong because she tried to accommodate and he was resistant. But some might argue she should have checked with him first. But since she did offer to switch and he still wanted to cancel, it's his issue. Hence, she's not at fault.\n"
