A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: She and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. They had the option of male or female masseuse, so she booked her boyfriend with the male one and herself with the female. He got upset and said he wouldn't let a man massage him because massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss it, but he called her irrational and said she was making it up to argue. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel his massage.\n\nThe author argues that massages are therapeutic, but the boyfriend sees them as sexual. The question is whether she's wrong for doing what she did.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about mutual comfort and respect in a relationship. She made a choice based on the available options, but didn't consider his feelings or preferences beforehand. Even though she thought massages are non-sexual, her boyfriend felt differently. By not checking with him first, she might have overstepped, especially since it's his personal comfort zone. \n\nShe tried to explain her reasoning, but he felt she was being argumentative. However, when she offered to switch, he refused and wanted to cancel. But the initial issue was that she scheduled him without considering his possible discomfort. In relationships, it's important to communicate personal boundaries. So, maybe she should have asked him which masseuse he preferred instead of making the choice for him. \n\nOn the other hand, he might be projecting his own feelings about massages as sexual, which could be a personal issue. But since she didn't consult him, she's partly at fault. The fact that she continued to push for a discussion might have escalated the situation instead of backing down when he expressed discomfort. \n\nSo, considering that she made the decision without his input and then the argument ensued, I think she's partially at fault. The answer might be A, that she's in the wrong. But I need to make sure. Another angle: is it her responsibility to make such decisions for him? Probably not. She should have discussed it first. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
