A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author (a woman) and her boyfriend (a man) planned to get massages together. She booked the male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. He's upset because he says massages are inherently sexual and won't let a man touch him. She tried to discuss it, even offered to switch, but he said to cancel and refused to go. She's still going without him.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and comfort. The author made a choice without considering her boyfriend's feelings. Even though she thought it was a practical decision (maybe splitting genders based on availability), she didn't ask him first. He's clearly uncomfortable, which is a big thing in a relationship. Communication is key here. She did try to explain her reasoning, but he felt she was being argumentative. However, he was also rigid in his stance and didn't want to compromise, even when she offered to switch. \n\nBut wait, the author's intention was to plan a shared activity, which is normal. She might not have realized his discomfort with male massageurs. However, she should have checked in with him before booking. On the other hand, he's being very firm about his boundaries without considering her effort to accommodate him. \n\nThe debate is whether her action was wrong. She didn't force him, offered to switch, but he refused to go. She's going ahead without him. So, maybe she's not completely at fault, but she could have discussed it first. However, he's being inflexible. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author is slightly at fault for making the decision without consulting him first. But he's also not being flexible. But the question is if she's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her action was a mistake. Since she made a choice that caused discomfort, even if with good intentions, she might share some responsibility. However, his reaction is also extreme. \n\nBut the main issue is consent and respect. By booking without asking, she didn't respect his potential boundaries. So maybe she's in the wrong. But he's being unreasonable too. However, the question is if she's in the wrong. The answer might be B (No) because she tried to resolve it, or A (Yes) because she didn't check first. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B, No. She made a mistake in not discussing it first, but the question is if she's in the wrong. Since she tried to understand and offered solutions, and he was rigid, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might say she should have checked. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B.\n"
