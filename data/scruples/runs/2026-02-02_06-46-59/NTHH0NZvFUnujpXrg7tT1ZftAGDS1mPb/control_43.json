A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who scheduled their boyfriend with a male masseuse is in the wrong. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together, and the user chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend then objects, saying that massages are inherently sexual and he won't let a man do it. The user tried to discuss it and asked for his reasoning, offering to switch masseuses, but he insisted on canceling and refused to go. Now the user is going to go without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user's action was based on availability; they just picked the opposite sex masseuses for each. They might not have considered the boyfriend's potential discomfort. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He states that massages are inherently sexual, which might be his personal belief, but he's in a monogamous relationship. The user is trying to understand his reasoning, which shows she's open to compromise. She even offers to switch, but he still cancels. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual understanding. The user didn't force the male masseuse on him; she scheduled based on availability. The boyfriend's refusal could stem from his own discomfort, which is his personal boundary. However, the user is now going ahead without him, which might be a consequence of his decision. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user isn't wrong for scheduling based on the given options. She made an effort to accommodate his feelings after he expressed discomfort. The boyfriend's stance seems more about his own personal boundaries and how he interprets the situation. Since the user tried to resolve it but he still chose to cancel, the responsibility isn't entirely on her. Therefore, the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
