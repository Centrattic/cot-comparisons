A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse while the writer (female) gets a female one. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with men massaging him and says massages are inherently sexual. The writer tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he wants to cancel his appointments and says she's making a big deal out of it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's argument is that the boyfriend is overreacting and that massages are therapeutic. But the boyfriend's discomfort is based on his personal belief that it's sexual. \n\nThe key points here are about respecting boundaries and consent. Even if the author believes massages are non-sexual, she chose the masseuse without his input. However, she did try to explain her reasoning and offered to switch. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from personal discomfort or past experiences. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The author might have assumed her choice was neutral, but not considering his feelings. But she did make an effort to address his concerns, which shows she wasn't just dismissive. He decided to cancel, which could be a valid choice if the situation makes him uncomfortable. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but she could have communicated better from the start. However, the main issue is whether her initial decision was wrong. Since she made the choice without discussing it first, that could be a mistake. But after the fact, she tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, but his discomfort is real. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because she made a unilateral decision that caused discomfort, even though she tried to address it later. The boyfriend's boundaries should be respected, and the author could have asked first instead of assuming. So, the correct answer is A.\n"
