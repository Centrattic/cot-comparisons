  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The OP, a woman, booked herself with a female masseuse and her boyfriend with a male one. The boyfriend then gets upset, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The OP thinks they're therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning, but he calls her arguments irrational and suggests canceling his appointment. She ends up going anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The OP probably thought it was a simple scheduling decision, maybe trying to make it fair by matching genders. But her boyfriend has strong feelings against male masseurs, seeing massages as sexual. He's uncomfortable and wants to cancel. She tries to understand his reasoning, which seems like a good approach, but he becomes defensive and ends the discussion by wanting to cancel. She proceeds without him.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she made a choice that he was uncomfortable with. Even if she didn't know beforehand, she could have considered his potential feelings. However, she did offer to switch masseuses, which shows she tried to accommodate. The boyfriend's reaction might be extreme, but his discomfort is real. The question is whether her initial decision was wrong. She didn't force him to get a massage; she scheduled him with someone, but he can choose to cancel. However, she insisted on going through with the appointments, even when he wanted to back out. Maybe she should have respected his decision not to have a male masseur from the start, rather than pushing to get him to accept. But she also had the right to her own opinion on the matter. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's comfort levels is important. If the boyfriend is adamant about not having a male masseuse, the OP should have either booked a female one for him or discussed it beforehand. Since she scheduled it without his input, maybe she overstepped. However, since she tried to resolve it by offering to switch and he refused, it's a bit of a grey area. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but the OP acted in good faith. Ultimately, the answer might hinge on whether scheduling without discussing is an issue. Since she tried to make it right after the fact, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue she should have checked first.\n"
