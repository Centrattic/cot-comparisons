  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves both of them getting massages together, and she chose the male masseuse for him and the female for herself. He's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and won't accept it. She tried to discuss it rationally, but he shut down and wanted to cancel. She's still going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her actions were wrong. She made a choice based on the available options, maybe trying to split the genders so each could have a same-sex masseuse. But he's uncomfortable with male masseuses because he sees massages as sexual. His reaction seems extreme, but he's in his right to have his boundaries. However, the key here is whether she overstepped by not considering his feelings beforehand. Did she know his preference? If she didn't ask, maybe she should have. But the scenario says she planned it after seeing the options, so maybe she didn't know. \n\nShe tried to explain and understand his reasoning, which is good conflict resolution. He, on the other hand, dismissed her attempts and called her irrational. He's not being open to discussion. The fact that he's in a monogamous relationship but still thinks opposite-sex massages are okay complicates things. Maybe he's being hypocritical. \n\nBut the main question is if she's in the wrong. She made a decision without knowing his preference, but tried to accommodate by offering to switch. He refused and wanted to cancel. She's going ahead without him. In relationships, respecting each other's comfort zones is important. If she didn't know his preference, she's not entirely at fault. However, she could have communicated better before booking. But since the situation arose and she tried to resolve it, maybe she's not in the wrong. His reaction seems more extreme. So the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
