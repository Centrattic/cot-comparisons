  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't want a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and tried to discuss it, even offering to switch. He ended up saying to cancel his massage and she went without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably thought she was being considerate by splitting the masseuses to match their genders, maybe to avoid making either of them uncomfortable. But the boyfriend has a different view and is uncomfortable with a male masseuse. He feels that massages have a sexual connotation, which the author disagrees with. \n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, showing she was willing to compromise. However, he refused and instead of finding a solution, he wanted to cancel. That's a bit of a problem because he's not engaging in the compromise. The author then went ahead without him, which might be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut wait, the author's initial action was to book them, which might have been an assumption. Maybe she should have checked with him first before deciding. However, since they were going together, splitting the masseuses by gender isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from his personal discomfort, which the author tried to address. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for each other's boundaries. The author tried to accommodate but the boyfriend's refusal to engage in discussion and insistence on cancellation might be more about his own discomfort than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like she made an effort to understand and compromise. The boyfriend's rigidity in not switching and wanting to cancel could be his issue. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
