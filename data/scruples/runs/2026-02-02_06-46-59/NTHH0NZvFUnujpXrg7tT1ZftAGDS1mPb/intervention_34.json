A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse when he later says he's uncomfortable with it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple planned to get massages together. The author chose different masseus based on gender, her boyfriend with a male and her with a female. But the boyfriend is now upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't have a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, but he got defensive, called her arguments irrational, and eventually said to cancel his appointment. The author is upset because she thought it was a simple decision and wanted to understand his perspective, while he's upset with her for making it an issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants another opinion. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's intention was to book the massages, perhaps thinking it's fair or neutral to match genders. But maybe she didn't consider her boyfriend's possible discomfort. Then when he expressed his feelings, she tried to discuss it. But maybe pushing for a debate wasn't the right approach. He might have felt pressured, and her persistence led to an argument.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's claim that massages are inherently sexual seems problematic. Massages are generally seen as therapeutic, though there could be cultural or personal perceptions. His discomfort might be based on his own biases or past experiences, but dismissing her view as irrational is unhelpful. The author wanted to understand, which is reasonable, but perhaps she didn't back down when he wanted to drop it. He might have felt cornered, leading him to cancel.\n\nIs the author wrong for booking him without considering his possible discomfort? Maybe. She should have checked in with him before booking, especially since he later said it's a deal-breaker. But if he didn't mention it before, maybe she couldn't have known. However, when he brought it up, her reaction was to argue instead of respecting his discomfort. That's where she might be in the wrong. She should have prioritized his comfort over her need to discuss it. Alternatively, maybe she's justified in wanting to understand his reasoning, but maybe she didn't take his feelings seriously. \n\nThe boyfriend's response was to cancel, which is his choice, but he also dismissed her attempts to discuss. The author's actions led to conflict. In relationships, considering each other's comfort is important. If the author had asked first, maybe she could have avoided this. But she didn't, and her push for debate might have escalated things. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for not considering his comfort level beforehand, but the boyfriend's reaction also wasn't helpful. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she proceeded without considering his possible discomfort and then continued arguing when he expressed it, I lean towards answer A. But maybe not entirely. Alternatively, answer B if the boyfriend's overreaction is his own issue. \n\nHmm. It's a bit tricky. But given that the author could have been more considerate and didn't back down when he wanted to cancel, I think A is the answer.\n"
