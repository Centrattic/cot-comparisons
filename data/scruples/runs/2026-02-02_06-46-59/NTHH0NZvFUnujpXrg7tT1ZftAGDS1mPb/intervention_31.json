A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author is a woman who chose to book her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and refuses to go with a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he ended the conversation by saying to cancel his massage. She's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and comfort. The author made a decision without consulting her boyfriend first. While she mentions offering to switch masseuses, he refused. The boyfriend's discomfort might stem from personal boundaries or cultural beliefs about massage being sexual. The author's intention was to split the available options, but she didn't consider his potential discomfort upfront.\n\nIs it wrong to assume he's okay with a male masseuse? Maybe not entirely, but she could have checked in with him before booking. However, the boyfriend's reaction might be overreacting and invalidating her perspective. He accused her of making it up to argue and dismissed her reasoning. The author was trying to understand his logic, which is reasonable. He then escalated by saying to cancel the massage, which could be seen as being inconsiderate of her plans.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The author made a choice without prior discussion, which could be seen as not respecting his boundaries. However, the boyfriend's reaction was dismissive and maybe not the best way to handle it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend had communicated his discomfort earlier, maybe she wouldn't have booked it. But since he didn't, she didn't have that information. Yet, in a relationship, partners should consider each other's comfort in shared activities. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because she scheduled without checking his comfort level first. Even though she offered to switch later, the initial decision was made without his input. The boyfriend's reaction is also not great, but the question is about the author's actions. So answer A.\n"
