A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend objects, saying massages are inherently sexual, and the author is trying to understand his reasoning. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author probably thought she was being fair, assigning each of them a masseuse of the opposite gender. But the boyfriend feels uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he views massages as sexual. Since they're in a monogamous relationship, he might be concerned about mixed signals or boundaries. The author, on the other hand, sees it as a therapeutic activity and is confused by his reaction.\n\nThe key points here are consent and comfort. The boyfriend was uncomfortable with the choice, and the author made the decision without consulting him first. Even though she offered to switch later, the initial decision went against his preferences. The boyfriend's reasoning about massages being sexual is his personal belief, and while it's valid for him to express that, the author's decision to assign him a male masseuse without his input could be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she's trying to be accommodating. But the fact that she scheduled it without asking him first might be the main issue. In relationships, considering each other's comfort and preferences is important. The boyfriend felt it was an issue of him being uncomfortable, and the author's approach might have triggered his insecurities.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were good, she might have overstepped by making the decision unilaterally. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his strong reaction suggest that his discomfort is significant. The author's persistence in trying to debate the issue might have made him feel invalidated, leading to his frustration.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not checking with her boyfriend first and not respecting his immediate discomfort, even though she tried to resolve it later. The initial action of scheduling without his input is the key point here.\n"
