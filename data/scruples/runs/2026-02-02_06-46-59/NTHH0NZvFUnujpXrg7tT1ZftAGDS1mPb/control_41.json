A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who then objects, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused, leading her to go alone.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author wanted to plan a shared activity, maybe to spend time together. She chose based on available options. The boyfriend felt uncomfortable, possibly due to personal boundaries or past experiences. The author's defense is that massages are therapeutic, so she's confused why he's uncomfortable. He argues they're sexual, hence his refusal.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she did consider his feelings by offering to switch, which shows effort to accommodate. He was adamant, so she went ahead without him. She wasn't forcing him; she made an offer. He's the one who said to cancel, but she chose to proceed. \n\nThe boyfriend's stance might be based on personal discomfort, but he's in a monogamous relationship, so maybe his reasoning is inconsistent. However, people have different boundaries. The author's actions don't seem malicious. She tried to understand and compromise. His reaction seems more about personal preference than her wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). The author didn't force the situation and tried to find a middle ground. His discomfort is his issue, and she's within her rights to proceed as long as it's his choice to opt out.\n"
