A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves scheduling a massage for their boyfriend with a male masseuse, which he's uncomfortable with because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he ended up canceling and being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and communication. The author made a choice based on available options, but the boyfriend felt uncomfortable. The author tried to talk it through and even offered to change the booking. The boyfriend's reaction seems pretty strong\u2014saying their opinion is irrational and refusing to go at all. \n\nMassages can be seen as either therapeutic or potentially sexual depending on the context and individual perspectives. The boyfriend's belief that massages are sexual is his personal view, which he has a right to, even if it's not shared by the author. The author's intention was to book a joint activity, which is understandable. However, not considering the boyfriend's discomfort before making the booking could be seen as the initial mistake. \n\nBut then, the author did try to address his concerns. The boyfriend's response of canceling and being confrontational might indicate that he's overreacting. The author isn't forcing the issue; they even offered to switch masseuses. The fact that the author is still going without him shows they aren't backing down, which could be a point. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's a bit of a gray area. The author should have checked with the boyfriend before booking, but once the issue came up, they tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his personal discomfort and possibly turning it into a conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whose actions are more at fault. The author's initial decision without input might be a small error, but the boyfriend's response seems more extreme. Since the author made an effort to accommodate, it's not clear they are in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they tried to resolve it, and the boyfriend's reaction was more of an overreaction.\n"
