A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and her boyfriend wanted to get massages together. The masseuses available were a male and a female. She booked her boyfriend with the male masseuse and herself with the female. The boyfriend is upset, saying he won't let a male massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning. He says she's being irrational and wants to cancel his massages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author probably thought it was fair to split the genders since they were available, maybe to avoid awkwardness or to keep it \"natural.\" But the boyfriend's discomfort is about the sexual aspect of massages. He might feel that a male masseuse would be inappropriate in a way that a female wouldn't, even in a monogamous relationship. \n\nWait, but if he's okay with a female masseuse, why the issue with male? Maybe it's about him feeling that the context or his own insecurities make a male masseuse uncomfortable. The author tried to debate and understand, but he felt she was pushing and not respecting his boundaries. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to accommodate his comfort level? She might have assumed that since he agreed to get a massage, he didn't mind the gender. But he clearly has a strong opinion. The key here is whether she overstepped by not checking with him first. \n\nThe author scheduled both without discussing the gender choice. Even if she thought it was logical, maybe she should have asked his preference. By assuming, she caused discomfort. Even if she tried to explain and offer to switch, his response was negative. So maybe she is in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries from the start. Alternatively, maybe the boyfriend is being unreasonable, but the question is about the author's actions. \n\nSince the author proceeded without considering his feelings, even though she tried to reason later, the initial action might be at fault. So answer A (Yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
