A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is about a planned couples massage where they had the option of male or female masseuses. The author chose the male for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend then refused the male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was neutral, seeing massages as therapeutic. She tried to understand his perspective, even offered to switch. He felt the author was being argumentative and insisted on pushing for something he's uncomfortable with. The key points are autonomy, consent, and mutual respect in relationships.\n\nThe boyfriend's discomfort is valid; some people have boundaries about opposite-sex professionals. The author wanted to understand his reasoning, which is good communication. However, she proceeded with the booking without his input, which he found problematic. He asked to cancel, but she went ahead anyway. \n\nThe issue here is whether respecting his boundaries was necessary. Even if he changed his mind later, the initial scheduling might have ignored his unspoken preference. The author's defense is that she wanted to avoid an argument, but pushing through when he expressed discomfort could be seen as not respecting his feelings. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reasoning that massages are inherently sexual is a bit confusing. If he's okay with a female masseuse in his own relationship, why is a male one suddenly an issue? That inconsistency might be the author's point. But the author's action was based on available options and her own perception. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate preferences, especially when it comes to personal boundaries. The author might have assumed her choice was neutral, but not considering his potential discomfort. Even though she offered to switch later, the initial decision could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether respecting his boundaries takes precedence over her decision. Since he's uncomfortable and she didn't check with him before booking, maybe the author is in the wrong. But some might argue that she had no way of knowing and tried to accommodate. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid, and not respecting that, especially after he expressed it, makes the author at fault. So, answer A.\n"
