A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (a woman) scheduled her boyfriend (a man) with a male masseuse, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and he's uncomfortable with a man. She argues that massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning, but he says she's wrong and even suggests canceling his appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a choice she thought was fair\u2014splitting the male and female masseuses. But her boyfriend has a valid discomfort. She tried to explain and understand his perspective, which is good. He, on the other hand, might be overreacting or projecting his own feelings onto the situation. The question is whether her initial decision was wrong.\n\nIs it wrong to book someone with a same-gender masseuse? Well, maybe not inherently, but if the other person has a strong objection, then respecting that might be necessary. The author tried to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. That could suggest she's trying to accommodate, but he's not being flexible. However, her intention might have been to be fair, and she didn't know his preference beforehand. \n\nThe key points: Did she overstep by not checking his preference first? Maybe. But she might not have known. Also, he's making it about her being wrong, which could be his issue. The fact that he's refusing to go at all because of this might indicate that he's not being reasonable. However, the author is going ahead without him, which shows she's okay with his decision. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the initial booking might not be her fault, but she could have asked his preference. But since she made the choice without knowing his feelings, she's in a bit of a bind. However, he's reacting strongly and not being open to discussion. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Maybe partially, but maybe not entirely. The question is whether her action was wrong. If she had known his preference, she wouldn't have booked it. Since she didn't, maybe she's not in the wrong. But she could have communicated better. However, the main issue is his reaction. The answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's trying to understand and compromise, while he's being rigid.\n"
