  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who scheduled their boyfriend with a male masseuse is in the wrong. The situation is about getting massages together, and the boyfriend objected because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it but he got defensive and wanted to cancel. They still went without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to plan something together, and they chose based on available options. The boyfriend's discomfort stems from a belief that massages are sexual, which might be based on his personal views or past experiences. The author tried to understand and even offered to switch, but he refused. \n\nIs the author wrong for choosing a male masseuse for her boyfriend? Well, the author didn't know his preference beforehand. Massages are generally considered therapeutic, but if the recipient has a specific discomfort, maybe the author should have asked first. But since the boyfriend didn't mention it before booking, maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme. He's dismissing her effort to understand and even accuses her of making it up to argue. That's not healthy communication. The author offered to switch, which shows she's trying to accommodate. However, the core issue is his belief about massages being sexual. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author had asked the boyfriend beforehand about his preference, maybe they could have avoided the conflict. But she didn't, and he didn't mention it. So it's a bit of a gray area. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but his response was dismissive. The author's actions were based on good intentions, trying to plan a shared activity. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because she tried to communicate and adjust. The boyfriend's refusal to engage constructively is his own issue. The author isn't at fault for not knowing his preference beforehand and making an effort to resolve the issue once it came up.\n"
