A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple planning to get massages together. The author, a woman, booked her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse and says massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning, but he gets defensive and says she's wrong. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author made a decision based on her understanding of massages being therapeutic. She might have assumed that the boyfriend would be okay with the male masseuse because she didn't know about his discomfort beforehand. But is it her responsibility to know his preferences before booking? Maybe she should have checked with him first instead of assuming. However, sometimes people make decisions without consulting others, especially if they think it's a minor choice like choosing a masseuse's gender.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a factor. He says the massages are sexual, which is his personal belief. The author is trying to understand his logic, which shows she's not just being stubborn. But he accuses her of making it up to argue. That's a red flag. His response is dismissive and confrontational. He's not open to discussion, which is his own issue. However, he did express discomfort, and the author offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. So maybe he's being unreasonable in his stance.\n\nThe author's intention was to book the massages, not to push her opinion. She wanted to understand his reasoning, which is reasonable. His response is what escalated the argument. The fact that she went ahead without him is her choice, but the initial question is whether she was wrong in scheduling him with a male masseuse. The key here is whether she had the right to make that decision without consulting him. If they planned the massages together, maybe she should have discussed the masseuse's gender with him first. But if she thought it was a neutral choice (like gender doesn't matter), perhaps she didn't realize it would be an issue.\n\nIn terms of AITA, it's often about empathy and respect. The author tried to understand his perspective, offered solutions, but he was rigid. So maybe the boyfriend is more at fault. However, the author's initial decision might have been hasty. But since the boyfriend is overreacting, she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she tried to accommodate his preferences and her initial decision wasn't malicious. The boyfriend's rigidity and unwillingness to compromise is his own problem.\n"
