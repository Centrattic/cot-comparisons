A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a woman, booked a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female one for herself. The boyfriend is upset and says massages are inherently sexual, so he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author thinks massages are just therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning. He gets defensive, says she's making it up to argue, and suggests canceling the appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author made a choice based on the available options and thought it was a neutral decision, assigning each of them a masseuse of the opposite gender. But the boyfriend has a strong objection. Now, in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and comfort levels. The author might not have realized that her boyfriend's discomfort is valid, even if she doesn't share that view. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author overstep by making a decision that made her partner uncomfortable? Was her approach to \"debate\" the issue appropriate? The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about a personal boundary. The author tried to understand but the discussion turned into an argument. Even though she offered to switch, he still wanted to cancel, which suggests he's really uncomfortable. \n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's feelings is important. Even if the author believes massages are not sexual, she might have dismissed her boyfriend's feelings by trying to debate it. Instead, she should have prioritized his comfort. However, the boyfriend's refusal to engage in any solution (cancelling instead of switching) could also be an issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I think the main issue is that she didn't consider his possible discomfort when making the booking. Even with good intentions, not discussing preferences beforehand might have been a mistake. The fact that he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse is a personal issue, and the author should have been more sensitive to that. So the answer might be A (Yes) because she made a decision that disregarded his comfort, even if unintentionally. However, some might argue that the boyfriend's reaction is over the top. But from the scenario, the author tried to understand but the conflict arose from the initial booking. So the author is at least partially in the wrong for not checking in first, even if the boyfriend's stance is rigid.\n"
