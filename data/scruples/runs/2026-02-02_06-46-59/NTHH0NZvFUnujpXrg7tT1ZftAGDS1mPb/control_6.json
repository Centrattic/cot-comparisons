  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple planning to get massages together. The girl scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend then objects, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The girl thinks they're therapeutic and wants to discuss his reasoning, but he says her opinion is irrational and refuses to switch. She ends up going alone.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, she made a choice based on available options. She tried to accommodate by offering to switch. The boyfriend's objection is about his comfort with the male masseuse due to his belief that massages are sexual. But the girl thinks they're not, leading to a discussion. He gets defensive and says she's arguing just to argue, then says canceling is too much trouble. She goes anyway.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girl's intention was to book based on the masseuse's availability and then tried to be accommodating. The boyfriend's refusal is about his personal comfort. She's trying to understand his reasoning, which seems reasonable. But he's not open to discussion and escalates by saying canceling is too much. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about respecting each other's boundaries. The girl isn't forcing him to do anything; she made a choice and then offered to adjust. The boyfriend's issue is his own boundary about massage gender. But by not being open to discussion and dismissing her attempts to understand, he's not being accommodating. However, the girl might not be in the wrong because she's respecting his choice by offering to switch but he's not allowing that. \n\nWait, but she scheduled him with a male masseuse without consulting him first. That could be a point. Maybe she should have asked his preference before booking. But the story says they planned to get massages together, and the booking was done with the available options. So maybe she thought splitting the masseuse genders was fair. However, his objection is valid if he's uncomfortable. But then she tried to switch. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she made an effort to adjust. The boyfriend's reaction is more rigid. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She tried to resolve it, he's being inflexible. But maybe some would say she should have checked with him first. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that she offered to switch, and he refused, it's more about his comfort and her willingness to adapt. So likely, the answer is B.\n"
