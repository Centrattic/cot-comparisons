A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend got upset and said massages are inherently sexual, so he didn't want a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. She chose male for him and female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, thinking it's sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to debate the issue.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the boyfriend's discomfort is real to him. Even if others see it as therapeutic, if he feels it's sexual, that's his personal boundary. The author tried to switch, but he wanted to cancel. Respecting boundaries is important. However, the author's intention was to understand, not to push. But maybe she didn't realize his discomfort was a firm no. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she tried to accommodate. But some might say she should have respected his initial choice without pushing. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. I think the key is that she tried to switch, showing she respected his feelings, so she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
