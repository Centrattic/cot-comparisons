A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they both planned to get massages together. The author picked a male for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend then says he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning, but he gets defensive and says she's wrong and even suggests canceling his massage.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the boyfriend's discomfort and the author's perspective. The author wanted to understand his reasoning, even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the boyfriend's feelings. If he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, then the author might be wrong for not respecting his boundary. But wait, she did offer to switch, which shows she tried to accommodate. Maybe she's not in the wrong because she made an effort to adjust but he still refused.\n\nThen, the boyfriend's reasoning about massages being inherently sexual seems a bit problematic. The author argues they're therapeutic, and the boyfriend's response is dismissive. If he's in a monogamous relationship, his discomfort with the opposite sex masseuse might be based on insecurity or other issues. The author's approach was to understand, which is reasonable. He, however, is being rigid and not open to discussion.\n\nBut maybe the author overstepped by initially assigning the male masseuse without considering his feelings. However, the options were male and female, so she split them by gender. It's possible she didn't know his preference beforehand. So she might have made an assumption based on the available options. Then, when he expressed discomfort, she tried to resolve it. His reaction of wanting to cancel and calling her irrational seems excessive.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the boyfriend clearly states that he's uncomfortable, the author should have considered that first. But she did try to switch, so maybe she's not in the wrong because she attempted to accommodate. The boyfriend's refusal and unwillingness to engage in discussion might place more responsibility on him.\n\nWait, but the initial act of booking without knowing his preference could be seen as a misstep. Maybe the author should have asked his preference before booking. However, in the scenario, she had to choose from two options and split them by gender, which is a reasonable approach. It's not like she intentionally chose a male masseuse to provoke him.\n\nThe boyfriend's assertion that massages are inherently sexual might be a personal belief, but if he's in a relationship where the act of getting a massage is considered okay with his partner, then his reasoning might be inconsistent. The author's push to understand his logic is valid, but his defensiveness and refusal to engage constructively could be his issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author tried to resolve the issue by offering a switch. The boyfriend's refusal and his harsh response indicate that he's not willing to compromise or communicate effectively. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she accommodated his request and he's the one who escalated the situation by wanting to cancel. The answer is B.\n"
