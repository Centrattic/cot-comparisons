  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend got upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, and she tried to discuss it, but he was resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted to book the massages together and chose based on gender, maybe thinking it would be more comfortable. The boyfriend, however, is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he sees massages as sexual. That's a personal belief, but it's his right to have that discomfort.\n\nThe author tried to understand his reasoning, which is good communication. But when he said it's inherently sexual, she challenged that by asking why it's acceptable in a monogamous relationship. That might have triggered defensiveness. He then refused to switch and wanted to cancel, which led to the author going without him.\n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong. She made a choice without considering his feelings first. Even if her intention was to be fair, she should have checked with him before booking. Maybe she assumed he'd be okay with it. But since he's clearly uncomfortable, she didn't respect his boundaries. The fact that she tried to debate it instead of just accommodating might have made it worse. However, she did offer to switch, which shows she's trying to resolve it. But he didn't accept and chose to cancel. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's comfort levels is important. So even if her intent was good, not checking first could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A, she's at fault.\n"
