A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse when they were going to get massages together. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a choice based on available options, perhaps thinking it's fair to split genders. But the boyfriend has a strong objection. The author's intention was to understand, not to push. But the boyfriend felt it was an argument and wanted to cancel. \n\nNow, the key points: the author didn't force the male masseuse on him; they offered to switch. The boyfriend's discomfort is based on his belief that massages are sexual. The author is trying to be rational, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The author's actions weren't malicious; they were trying to be fair. However, the boyfriend's boundaries are important. The author continued to proceed even after he wanted to cancel, which might be where the conflict is. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they respected his discomfort by offering to switch and even went ahead when he wanted to cancel, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's own feelings are valid, but the author's actions were reasonable. The author tried to be accommodating. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But some might say the author should have considered his feelings more. But since they made an effort, maybe not. So I think the answer is B.\n"
