  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking a male masseuse for her boyfriend. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. The author tried to understand his reasoning and offered to switch, but he didn't want to switch and ended up not going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to plan a massage together, so she chose based on availability. She might not have realized his discomfort beforehand. The boyfriend's issue is about feeling that massages have a sexual connotation, which could be a personal belief. However, the author tried to engage in a discussion and even offered a solution. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit over the top\u2014saying she's wrong for no reason and then canceling entirely. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand. It's common to not be aware of someone's specific boundaries unless communicated clearly. She made an effort to accommodate him by offering to switch, so she's trying to be respectful. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and the argument might be his own issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
