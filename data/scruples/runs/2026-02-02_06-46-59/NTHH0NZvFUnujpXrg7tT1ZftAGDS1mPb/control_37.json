A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple planned to get massages together. The author (female) booked the boyfriend (male) with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and is trying to understand his reasoning. The boyfriend refuses to switch and wants to cancel his massage. The author is going ahead without him.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The boyfriend is clearly uncomfortable with a male masseuse, which he associates with the massage being sexual. The author, on the other hand, sees it as a therapeutic service and is trying to rationalize his stance. \n\nIs the author wrong for scheduling him with a male masseuse? Well, she might have assumed that the choice of masseuse gender wasn't important. But once he expressed discomfort, she offered to switch. The boyfriend, however, refused and wanted to cancel. So the author made an effort to accommodate his feelings, which is a good sign. \n\nThe boyfriend's refusal could be about his personal boundaries. Even if the author sees it as irrational, she's not forcing him to go through with the male masseuse. She's offering to switch, but he declines. In that case, the author is respecting his choice by not pressuring him further. \n\nBut wait, the author's initial action was to assign him a male masseuse without his input. Maybe she should have checked with him first instead of assuming he was okay with it. That could be a point where she went wrong. However, in some contexts, like booking services for others, it's common unless specified otherwise. \n\nBut since the boyfriend has a strong opinion about it, perhaps the author should have discussed it beforehand. However, the main conflict arises after the booking. She tried to understand his reasoning, offered to switch, and he still refused. So the author isn't forcing him; she's just following through with her original plan unless he changes his mind. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He calls her opinion irrational and accuses her of making it up to argue. That's not respectful. The author is trying to understand his perspective, which is a reasonable approach. But she might have overstepped by not checking with him before booking. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The author's initial action might have been a mistake, but she did try to resolve it. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his confrontational response are also problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's not forcing him and is accommodating his request to cancel, maybe she's not. But if she should have asked first, maybe she is. \n\nHmm. In many relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. If the author didn't know about his discomfort beforehand, she might not be at fault. But once he expressed it, she made an effort to adjust. The boyfriend's refusal is his own issue. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
