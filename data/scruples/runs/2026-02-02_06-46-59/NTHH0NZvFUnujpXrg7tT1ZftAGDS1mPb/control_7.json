  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author (a woman) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend (who is male) with a male masseuse while she got a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a male masseuse. The author thinks they're just therapeutic and wants to understand his reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and comfort. The boyfriend expressed discomfort with male masseuses, so the author should respect that. But the author tried to understand his logic, even offered to switch. The boyfriend then says to cancel his massage. The author is going without him. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did she respect his boundaries? She initially scheduled him with a male masseuse without considering his discomfort. Even though she offered to switch later, the initial decision might have been dismissive of his feelings. However, she tried to resolve it by offering a switch. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, but his comfort is important.\n\nMassages can be seen differently by people. Some may find same-sex masseuses uncomfortable. The author's reasoning that they are therapeutic is valid, but she should have checked with him before booking. Maybe she didn't consider his feelings first, leading to the conflict. But she's trying to understand and compromise. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author might be in the wrong for not considering his discomfort upfront. On the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and cancellation might be his way of asserting his needs. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the initial action of booking without considering his feelings could make her at fault. So, answer A.\n"
