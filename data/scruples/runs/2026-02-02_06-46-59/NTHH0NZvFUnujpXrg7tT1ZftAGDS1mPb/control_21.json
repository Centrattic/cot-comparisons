  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a woman) is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. She wanted to get massages together and chose based on the available masseuse genders. The boyfriend then refused to go, saying massages are inherently sexual, which she disagrees with. He's upset and wants her to cancel his appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she did something wrong. She made a choice based on the available options, possibly assuming it was neutral. The boyfriend's discomfort might stem from personal beliefs, but is her action wrong? She tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch. He dismissed her and refused to go. \n\nThe key points: She didn't force him; she tried to accommodate. He's the one who escalated it by saying she's wrong and that it's too much trouble. His reaction seems more about his own discomfort than her being in the wrong. Massages can be seen as either therapeutic or with sexual connotations, but she's in the right to have her own view. Since she's not forcing him and is respecting his decision by going without him, she's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
