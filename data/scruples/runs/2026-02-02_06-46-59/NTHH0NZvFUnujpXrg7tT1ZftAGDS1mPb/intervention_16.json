A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse and the boyfriend being uncomfortable, claiming massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he ended up canceling his appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to split the genders for the massages, which seems reasonable. She might have thought it's standard or that it's about preferring same-gender massage for some reason. The boyfriend, however, feels that massages are sexualized, so a male masseuse makes him uncomfortable. His initial reaction is to refuse and cancel, but the author tries to address it by offering to switch, which he refuses again, leading to cancellation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she did book him with a male masseuse without asking first. That could be seen as assuming his preference, which he doesn't have. But she tried to communicate and offer solutions. The boyfriend's stance is that massages are sexual, which might be a personal belief. However, by not discussing it beforehand, the author may have overstepped. On the other hand, the boyfriend's refusal to switch and eventual cancellation could be seen as being inflexible. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't check with him before booking, which is a valid issue. But she made an effort to resolve the conflict. The boyfriend's discomfort is his right, but his response to cancel entirely might be excessive. However, the author's initial action was the trigger. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not confirming his preference, but the boyfriend's reaction also plays a role. \n\nIn terms of who is more in the wrong, the AITA format usually looks for who is at fault. Since the author didn't ask first and then the boyfriend reacted strongly, maybe the author is in the wrong. But some might argue that the boyfriend's own beliefs make him responsible. However, since she didn't consider his possible discomfort and made the choice unilaterally, that's where the issue is. So the answer might be A.\n"
