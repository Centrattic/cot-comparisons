  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple booking massages together. The woman scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a man massaging him. The woman tries to understand his reasoning, offers to switch, but he insists on canceling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman's reasoning is that she wants to understand his logic and that she's not making it up. She even offers to switch masseuses, showing flexibility. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is uncomfortable because he perceives massages as sexual, which is a valid personal boundary. The key points here are consent and personal comfort.\n\nThe woman's actions were based on the available options and splitting the genders. But the boyfriend's discomfort is about his own boundaries. She tried to engage in a discussion and offered solutions, but he refused to compromise beyond canceling. The question is whether she was wrong in her initial decision.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The woman didn't know beforehand that he felt this way. She made a choice, and upon learning his discomfort, tried to adjust. However, the boyfriend's refusal to accept a switch shows that her initial choice violated his personal boundaries. But was she in the wrong? She didn't know his preference ahead of time, so maybe not. However, she could have checked first. But since the options were presented at the time of booking, maybe that's not her fault. Alternatively, by not discussing with him before booking, she might have overlooked his feelings. \n\nThe debate is whether the woman's action was wrong in the first place. The boyfriend's discomfort is valid, but the woman's intent was to split the genders. The problem arises because she didn't consider his potential discomfort. However, she tried to resolve it by offering a switch. Since he's in a monogamous relationship, his concern about the massage being sexual might be a personal issue. The woman's attempt to understand and adjust shows she's trying to be considerate. But the fact that he's unwilling to accept any solution (even switching) and calls her argument irrational might indicate that the issue is more about his personal insecurity rather than a valid reason. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the woman made a choice without prior knowledge. The boyfriend's refusal to compromise could be seen as the main issue here. However, the woman could have communicated better before booking. So, there's a nuance. But in many AITA scenarios, the person who makes the decision without considering a partner's possible discomfort is often seen as at fault. However, in this case, she tried to adjust, which is a positive step. \n\nThe key here is whether she was wrong for not knowing his preference. Since it's a first-time experience, maybe not. But she could have discussed it first. The answer might be more on the side of B, not in the wrong, because she tried to resolve it, and the refusal was the boyfriend's issue. However, some might argue that she should have checked beforehand.\n"
