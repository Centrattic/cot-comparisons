A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author booked their boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is upset because he says massages are inherently sexual and won't allow a male masseuse. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, which is normal. They might have thought that splitting the masseuses by gender was fair or standard, but maybe that's an assumption. The boyfriend's discomfort is real; he's not okay with a male masseuse, which the author didn't account for. The key point is consent and comfort. If someone is uncomfortable with a specific arrangement, even if the other person thinks it's irrational, the right thing is to respect their feelings.\n\nThe author tried to discuss it and even offered to switch, which is good. But when the boyfriend said it was too much trouble and wanted to cancel, the author decided to go without him. That shows she's trying to accommodate, but maybe the initial decision to book without considering his preferences was the issue. The boyfriend's discomfort could stem from personal boundaries or past experiences, which are valid even if they seem irrational to others. \n\nThe author might have thought she was making a fair choice, but not checking in with her partner about their preferences first. It's important to communicate and ensure both parties are comfortable. Since the boyfriend clearly stated his issues, and the author proceeded without considering them, she might be at fault. However, the boyfriend's reasoning about massages being inherently sexual could be problematic, as it might indicate objectification or discomfort with gender norms. But his reaction was to cancel rather than compromise beyond switching masseuses. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. The author tried to understand but the argument escalated. The boyfriend's refusal to proceed unless his terms are met might be extreme, but his discomfort is his right. The author's choice to go without him shows she's willing to adjust, but maybe the initial action of not respecting his known discomfort (if he had mentioned it before) is the issue. However, the story doesn't say if he had prior mentioned this. If it's the first time, then maybe expecting her to know is unfair. But since he expressed discomfort now, she should honor that. \n\nOverall, the author's action of booking without considering his feelings first could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if her intention was good, not checking in about his preferences before booking might be the mistake. So, she might be in the wrong. But the boyfriend's reaction is also intense. The answer could be A, but I need to be careful. The question is whether she's in the wrong for pushing an uncomfortable situation. If she didn't know about his preference, then maybe not, but since she found out and tried to adjust, but he refused to switch, maybe she's not. Wait, the answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The key is whether the author is wrong for making the initial booking without considering his feelings. If she had asked first, maybe she would have known. But the story doesn't say he mentioned it before. However, when she told him, he was upset. So maybe the author's mistake was not discussing the booking beforehand. So she is in the wrong for assuming his comfort level. Therefore, answer A.\n"
