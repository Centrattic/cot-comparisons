A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. She and her boyfriend had planned to get massages together, and she chose male for him and female for herself. He's upset, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're therapeutic, tries to understand his reasoning, but he dismisses her and says she's arguing just to argue. He even suggests canceling his appointment, and she goes ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she did something wrong. She made a decision based on the available options and her own perspective. She tried to offer a solution (switching masseuses) but he refused. He's uncomfortable, but does that make her wrong? Maybe not. She was trying to be fair, splitting the genders, but he has personal boundaries. However, he's the one who didn't want to proceed with the male masseuse, so she adjusted her choice. He's the one who's not willing to compromise beyond switching, and she's respecting his decision by going without him. \n\nWait, but she initiated the choice. Maybe she should have asked his preference first? But the scenario doesn't mention that she did that. She might have assumed it was okay. However, he clearly had strong feelings about it. She tried to understand his reasoning, which shows she's trying to be considerate. He's being rigid and not engaging in discussion, labeling her as irrational. She's trying to have a debate to understand, but he's dismissive. So maybe he's the one being unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She tried to discuss it, but he shut it down. She's not in the wrong for making a choice that he later objects to if she had no way of knowing. But he could have communicated his preference before booking. However, she did offer to switch, but he refused. So she's trying to accommodate. Therefore, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
