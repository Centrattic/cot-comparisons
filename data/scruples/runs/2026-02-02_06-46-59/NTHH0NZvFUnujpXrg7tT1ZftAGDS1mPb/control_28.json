A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse when they planned to get massages together. The author (a woman) chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend and female for herself. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a man to massage him. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, but he accused her of making it up to argue. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She went ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The key points are: she made a choice without consulting him, he's uncomfortable, and there's a disagreement about the nature of massages. When planning a shared activity, it's important to consider the other person's preferences. Even if the author thought it was a neutral decision, not consulting him might have been an oversight. However, he did express discomfort with male masseurs, so maybe she should have checked his preference first. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's argument is that massages are sexual, which might be a personal belief. The author thinks they're therapeutic. The boyfriend's refusal to switch could be rigid. The author offered to switch, showing willingness to accommodate. He then refused and wanted to cancel. The author went without him. So the question is whether she was wrong to schedule without asking. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't realize his discomfort, she might have assumed he'd be okay. But since he later expressed strong feelings, maybe she should have discussed it first. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He accuses her of being irrational and making up reasons. The author tried to understand his logic, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's possible she should have asked him which masseuse he prefers instead of choosing. But she did offer to switch after he expressed discomfort. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and canceling might be his own inflexibility. The author's intent was to plan a shared activity, not to force him into something. The main issue is whether her initial decision was wrong. Since she didn't consult him first, maybe she's partially at fault. But since she tried to resolve it, perhaps not entirely. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether prior consultation was necessary. In many cases, sharing preferences is good, so maybe she's not wrong. But the answer might hinge on that point. I think the answer is B (No), because she made an effort to accommodate and the boyfriend's stance is rigid. She's not in the wrong.\n"
