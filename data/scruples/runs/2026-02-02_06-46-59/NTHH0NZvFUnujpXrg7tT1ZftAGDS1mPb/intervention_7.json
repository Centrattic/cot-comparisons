A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author is a woman, her boyfriend is male. They planned to get massages together, and she booked him with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning but he got defensive, called her arguments irrational, and canceled his appointment.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a choice based on available options and perhaps thinking it was fair to split the genders. The boyfriend has a personal discomfort with male masseuses, which he attributes to massages being sexual. The author tried to discuss it and even offered to switch, but he refused and canceled. \n\nIs the author wrong for making that initial choice? Well, the author didn't know the boyfriend's preference beforehand. It's possible she didn't consider his comfort level. However, once he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate by offering to switch. The boyfriend's refusal might be the issue here. \n\nBut the author could argue that she had no way of knowing his preference and that it's his responsibility to communicate. However, she might also be expected to consider his feelings in such personal situations. Massages can be intimate, and choosing a same-sex masseuse might be a common courtesy. \n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning that massages are sexual might be a personal belief, but if he's uncomfortable, then the author's action could be seen as not respecting his boundaries. However, she did try to adjust after he raised the issue. \n\nAlternatively, the boyfriend's reaction could be over the top. He didn't want to discuss the reasoning and dismissed her attempts to understand. He canceled the appointment, which might be his right, but the author is left going alone. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a grey area. The author might be in the wrong for not checking his preference first, but she tried to fix it. The boyfriend's response was also problematic. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she made an honest mistake and tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's rigid stance and refusal to compromise might be more at fault here. But the initial decision might have been careless. Wait, but the author's intention wasn't to cause discomfort. She might have thought splitting the genders was fair. The boyfriend's belief that massages are inherently sexual is a personal issue, but if he's uncomfortable, the author's action could be seen as not respecting that. \n\nHmm. It's tricky. Some might say the author is in the wrong for not considering his feelings, while others might say the boyfriend is being overly sensitive. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nI think the key here is that the author had no prior knowledge of the boyfriend's discomfort. She tried to adjust when he mentioned it, but he refused. The act of initially booking him with a male masseuse might not be entirely her fault if she didn't know. However, maybe she should have considered that some people prefer same-sex masseuses for comfort. But without knowing his preference, it's hard to say. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend should have communicated his preference earlier, but the author could also be expected to be considerate in such a personal situation. Since she did make an effort to switch after he raised the issue, maybe she's not entirely at fault. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author isn't in the wrong because she tried to accommodate his request. The boyfriend's rigid response is more problematic.\n"
