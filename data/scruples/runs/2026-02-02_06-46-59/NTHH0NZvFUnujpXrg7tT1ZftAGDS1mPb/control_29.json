  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about scheduling a male masseuse for her boyfriend, who later says he's uncomfortable with that and even suggests canceling the massage.\n\nFirst, the author chose the male masseuse for her boyfriend, thinking the massages are purely therapeutic. The boyfriend objects, stating that massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he refused and wanted to cancel.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for making that initial choice? Well, she made a decision based on her own perception of the situation. She didn't know his discomfort beforehand. It's possible that she didn't consider his feelings, but she did try to accommodate his request after he expressed discomfort. The key here is whether she overstepped by not considering his possible feelings initially. However, since the boyfriend is an adult and he's the one who decided to object later, the responsibility might lie more with him for not communicating his preference earlier. The author's intention was to plan something for both of them, and when he expressed discomfort, she tried to resolve it. So, she might not be in the wrong because she didn't know about his feelings beforehand and made an effort to adjust.\n"
