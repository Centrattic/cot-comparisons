A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, a woman, and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. They had the option of a male or female masseuse, so she scheduled the boyfriend with the male one and herself with the female. When she told him, he was upset and said he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tried to understand his reasoning, but he dismissed her and said she was just arguing. He even offered to cancel his massages and refused to switch, so she went alone. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The question is whether she's at fault. Let me break it down. The author made a decision based on the available options, probably trying to split the genders to match her own preference. But her boyfriend had a strong objection based on his view of massages being sexual. She tried to discuss it and understand, but he shut her down, calling her irrational. She even offered to switch, but he refused. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, she might not have considered his boundaries before making the booking. But she didn't know his feelings beforehand\u2014that's part of the situation. On the other hand, he could have communicated his discomfort earlier. However, the author tried to accommodate by offering to switch, which he rejected. \n\nMassages can be a sensitive topic because some people view them as intimate, especially same-sex massages. The author's reasoning is that they're therapeutic, but others might see them differently. In a relationship, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The author made a choice based on her understanding, but maybe she should have checked in with him first. However, since he didn't mention his feelings before she scheduled it, it's a bit of a mutual misunderstanding. \n\nHe also escalated the issue by refusing to switch and canceling, which might be his way of asserting his boundary. The author's persistence to understand is good, but he wasn't open to discussion. So, is she wrong? Maybe not entirely. She tried to be accommodating after the fact. The main issue is that she assumed his comfort level without knowing, but it's a situation where both could have communicated better. \n\nIn the end, the author decided to go alone, so she's not forcing him to go through with something he's uncomfortable with. Her initial action might be seen as overstepping, but the resolution shows she respects his choice. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have asked first. But since he didn't communicate his issue earlier, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key point is that she tried to make a decision based on available options, didn't intend to make him uncomfortable, and when she realized it was an issue, she offered solutions. He, however, was rigid in his response. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
