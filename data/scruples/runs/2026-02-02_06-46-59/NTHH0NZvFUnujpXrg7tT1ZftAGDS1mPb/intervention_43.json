A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman who booked massages for both her boyfriend and herself. She chose a male masseuse for him and a female one for herself. The boyfriend is a male and he gets upset, saying he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks massages are therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning, but he accuses her of being irrational and making it an argument. She offers to switch masseuses, but he wants to cancel. She ends up going without him.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, she made a choice without consulting him. Even though they were planning to get massages together, she scheduled him with a male masseuse. Maybe she assumed it's okay since they were going together, but maybe she should have discussed it first. However, she did offer to switch once he expressed discomfort, which shows she tried to accommodate his feelings.\n\nHe feels massages are sexual, which is his personal belief. Even if that belief might seem odd to others, it's his right to feel that way. If the author respected his wishes from the start, maybe there wouldn't be an issue. But she scheduled him with a male masseuse without considering his comfort. That could be seen as not respecting his boundaries.\n\nBut then, the author tried to have a discussion and understand his reasoning, offering to switch. He then got defensive and refused to engage, leading to the argument. The author's intent was to understand, not to push. He, on the other hand, refused to compromise beyond canceling. \n\nSo, is the author at fault for not checking in before booking? Possibly. If they had discussed the options beforehand, they could have reached a mutual decision. By making the choice unilaterally, even if with good intentions, she might have overstepped. But if the boyfriend had communicated his discomfort earlier, maybe the situation could have been avoided.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Discomfort with opposite-sex masseuses might stem from a problematic view of massages as inherently sexual, which is not a widely accepted perspective. But that's his belief. The author's stance that massages are therapeutic is more common, but she shouldn't impose her view on him.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be partially at fault for not checking in first, but the boyfriend's rigidity and refusal to compromise also plays a role. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she made a decision without his input and then the boyfriend felt his boundaries were violated, it's possible she's in the wrong. But if the boyfriend had communicated his preferences earlier, maybe the problem wouldn't have occurred. \n\nAlternatively, considering that she did try to switch after he expressed discomfort, maybe she's not entirely at fault. The key point is whether she should have discussed it before booking. If she had, she could have respected his wish for a female masseuse. Since she didn't, and then had to adjust after the fact, but he still refused to go, it's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nIn many relationships, partners should communicate preferences and boundaries. The author might have overlooked that step. So, answer A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she made the decision without considering his comfort level first. Even though she tried to fix it later, the initial choice was the issue.\n"
