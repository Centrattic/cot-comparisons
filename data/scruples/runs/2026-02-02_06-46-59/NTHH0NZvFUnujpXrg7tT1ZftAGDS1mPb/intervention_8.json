  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who planned to get massages together. The author, a woman, scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse, while she got the female one. The boyfriend doesn't want a male masseuse because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, offered to switch masseuses, but he was upset and wanted to cancel. Now she's going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, which is generally a positive thing. She made a choice based on available options, maybe thinking it was fair or neutral. The boyfriend's issue is about his personal comfort, relating to the sexualization of massages. This is a valid personal boundary. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author didn't force the male masseuse on him; she tried to communicate after the fact. When he expressed discomfort, she offered alternatives. But he was resistant and even wanted to cancel. The author then proceeds without him. \n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, if the boyfriend had said upfront that he's uncomfortable with male masseuses, she might have made a different choice. However, she scheduled it with good intentions. His reaction seems to be about his own boundaries, which he might not have communicated clearly. The author's actions were based on available info and her understanding. She tried to be flexible, so maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut also, maybe the author should have asked first instead of assuming. However, in some cases, people might not know their own preferences until presented with the situation. The boyfriend's reaction could be a personal issue, not her fault. So, balancing these, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she acted in good faith and tried to accommodate, while his discomfort is his own issue.\n"
