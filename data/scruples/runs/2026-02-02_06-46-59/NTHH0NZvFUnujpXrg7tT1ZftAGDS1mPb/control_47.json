A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She thinks they're therapeutic and is trying to understand his perspective, but he refuses and even suggests canceling the appointment. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a choice based on the available options (male and female masseuses) and assigned them each a masseuse of the opposite sex. Her reasoning was about equal treatment or maybe just splitting the options. But the boyfriend objects because he feels massages have a sexual connotation for him. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are about consent, understanding each other's boundaries, and communication. She tried to discuss his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he was adamant. He felt uncomfortable and wanted to cancel. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, respecting each other's boundaries is important. Even if she didn't agree with his reasoning, she could have considered his comfort level. However, she also had a valid point about wanting to understand his perspective and even made an offer to resolve the issue. \n\nBut he escalated the situation by suggesting cancellation, which might indicate that he's being rigid. However, the author's initial action might have disregarded his potential discomfort. The question is whether assigning a male masseuse to him was an overstep when she knew he had a preference against male masseuses.\n\nWait, did she know he had an issue with male masseuses beforehand? The story says he told her he would never let a man massager him. So she booked him with a male one despite knowing that. That's a key point. If she knew he was uncomfortable and still booked it, that's her being inconsiderate. But the scenario says she didn't know until after booking. Wait, no\u2014 she scheduled him with the male masseuse, then told him, and he objected. Wait, the original text says: \"When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him.\" So she scheduled him with a male masseuse without knowing his preference. That's the issue. She made a decision without considering his possible discomfort. \n\nIn that case, she's the one who didn't communicate properly. Even if the masseuse options were split male and female, she assumed assigning based on gender was okay. But the boyfriend had a strong objection. So she's in the wrong for not checking his preferences first. \n\nBut then she tried to understand and offer a solution. However, the initial action was the problem. So the answer would be A, Yes, the author is in the wrong for not considering his comfort level before scheduling. But wait, maybe she didn't know. The problem is that she assumed his preference wasn't an issue. The boyfriend's right to his own boundaries is important. Even if the author thought it was irrational, she should have respected his comfort from the start. So yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
