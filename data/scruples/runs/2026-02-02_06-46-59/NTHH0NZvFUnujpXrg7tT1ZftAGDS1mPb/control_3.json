A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend both wanted massages together. The options were a male or female masseuse. She chose the male for him and female for herself. Then the boyfriend objected, saying he wouldn't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. She tried to discuss it, but he got defensive, called her arguments irrational, and said she was making it up. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel his massage. She went ahead without him.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author made a choice based on availability, but the boyfriend had a personal boundary. She tried to understand his reasoning but he dismissed her. He felt uncomfortable and wanted to cancel, but she insisted on going. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she had good intentions, trying to plan together, but maybe she should have considered his preferences first. But he didn't communicate his discomfort earlier. Also, he's being rigid and not open to compromise. She offered to switch, but he refused and canceled. She's going without him, which is her choice. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. It seems like both sides have some issues. She made a decision without fully considering his possible preferences, but he didn't express his boundaries earlier. However, after he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate but he refused. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe she should have checked with him before booking, but he was also being inflexible. Since she tried to resolve it and he didn't want to, maybe she's not in the wrong. She's standing by her choice once he's being unreasonable. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
