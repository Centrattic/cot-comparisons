A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for scheduling their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they planned to get massages together, and the author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he views massages as inherently sexual. The author tried to discuss it, but he got defensive, said she was being irrational, and eventually wanted to cancel his appointments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's intention was to plan a shared activity, which is understandable. She might have thought splitting the masseuses based on gender was the default, not realizing it's an issue. But the boyfriend's discomfort is real. If he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse, the author should have respected that. However, she tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, which shows she wasn't being inconsiderate. \n\nBut here's the thing: the boyfriend's argument is that massages are sexual, which the author disagrees with. He then frames her as being argumentative instead of respecting his feelings. The author might have overstepped by not immediately accepting his discomfort and instead trying to debate it. Even though she offered to switch, his final reaction was to cancel, which could indicate he's being overly rigid. \n\nThe key point is about respecting comfort levels. The author didn't know beforehand that her boyfriend was uncomfortable with male masseuses, but once he expressed it, she tried to accommodate. However, her initial decision to assign a male masseuse without checking in with him first might be where the problem started. It's possible she assumed it was a neutral choice, but in doing so, she didn't consider his personal boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend could have communicated his discomfort earlier. But once he did explain, the author's response was to engage in a debate rather than immediately backing down. That might have made him feel like she wasn't respecting his feelings, which is where the argument arises. \n\nSo, the author might be slightly in the wrong for not checking his comfort level before booking, but the boyfriend's reaction was also harsh. However, since the main question is about the author's actions, the fact that she didn't ask first and then tried to debate instead of immediately respecting his discomfort could mean she's at least partially in the wrong. But whether it's entirely her fault is debatable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the action was thoughtless or inconsiderate. Since the author didn't know about the discomfort and tried to resolve it, maybe she's not entirely wrong. But the fact that she pushed for understanding instead of immediately respecting his wishes might tip the scales. So I'm leaning towards A, but I'm a bit conflicted. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also extreme. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A because she didn't consider his boundaries upfront, even if she tried to fix it later.\n"
