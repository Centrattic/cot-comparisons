  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about scheduling a boyfriend with a male masseuse. The author, who's a woman, booked her boyfriend (a man) with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with this and claims that massages are inherently sexual, so he prefers a female masseuse. The author thinks massages are purely therapeutic and tries to understand his reasoning but ends up in an argument. He refuses to switch and eventually cancels his appointment. The author is still going ahead without him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's intention was to split the available masseuse options by gender, which seems fair on the surface. But the boyfriend has a clear discomfort with a male masseuse because he perceives massages as sexual. That's a valid personal discomfort. The author, however, is pushing to understand his reasoning, which could be seen as trying to engage in a debate rather than respecting his feelings. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and his dismissal of her reasoning as irrational might be the bigger issue here, but the author's initial action of assigning a male masseuse without considering his feelings could be the root of the problem.\n\nThe key points are: Is the author wrong for not considering his feelings initially, or is the boyfriend wrong for not being more open to discussion? The author might argue that she wanted to split the available options, but she might have overlooked his comfort. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic because he dismisses her attempts to understand his perspective. However, the author's action was the catalyst for the argument. Maybe both have some faults here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she had asked him his preference before booking, maybe the issue wouldn't have arisen. Her assumption might have been the problem. So, maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for not respecting his feelings upfront.\n"
