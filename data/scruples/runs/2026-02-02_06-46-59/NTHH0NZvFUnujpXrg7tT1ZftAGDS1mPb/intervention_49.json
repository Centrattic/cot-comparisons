A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for booking their boyfriend with a male masseuse. The boyfriend got upset because he said massages are inherently sexual and he wouldn't let a man do it. The author tried to reason with him but he called her irrational and said she was making it up to argue. The author then went without him, but he said to cancel his appointments.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The author's intention was to schedule massages for both of them, choosing one male and one female masseuse. The boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse due to perceiving massages as sexual. The author tried to understand his reasoning and even offered to switch, but he became defensive and wanted to cancel. The author continued without him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: She wanted to plan something nice for both of them. She made a choice based on the available options. When the boyfriend expressed discomfort, she tried to engage in a discussion to understand his reasons. She even offered a compromise (switching masseuses), which he rejected. She then decided to proceed without him. Her actions seem to be about wanting to share an activity and being open to negotiation.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective: He finds the idea of a male masseuse unacceptable because he associates massages with sexuality. Since they're in a monogamous relationship, he might feel that any opposite-sex interaction could be a trigger for him, even if it's purely professional. He felt the author was being argumentative and dismissive, which could have caused tension. His response to cancel might be his way of avoiding discomfort.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand, so it's possible she made an assumption about his comfort level. However, once he expressed discomfort, she tried to accommodate by offering a switch. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the author was willing to adjust. The key point is whether the author should have known not to book a male masseuse for him. Since he didn't mention this preference before, it's hard to say she was negligent. However, maybe she should have considered that some people might have such boundaries even if not stated. \n\nBut then again, massages are common and often involve opposite-sex professionals without issue. The boyfriend's belief that massages are inherently sexual is a personal view, which the author is challenging by seeing them as therapeutic. The debate here isn't necessarily about right or wrong but differing perspectives. The author's insistence to discuss might have been seen as pushing, but she was trying to understand. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and wanting to cancel seems to prioritize his discomfort over their planned activity. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often looks at intentions and actions. The author's intention was to plan a shared experience, and she tried to resolve the issue. The boyfriend's reaction might be inconsiderate, but the author could have been more aware of potential discomfort. However, without prior knowledge, it's a bit of a grey area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe she could have handled it better by asking first. But since the question is whether she is in the wrong, the answer would depend on if her actions were unreasonable. Since she tried to adapt and he was rigid, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have considered his possible discomfort regardless of his not stating it before. It's a tough call. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she acted in good faith and tried to accommodate.\n"
