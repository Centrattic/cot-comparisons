A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author (a woman) and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. She scheduled him with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. When she tells him, he says he won't let a man massage him because he thinks massages are inherently sexual. The author thinks they're therapeutic and tries to discuss his reasoning. He accuses her of being irrational and making it up to argue. She offers to switch, but he wants to cancel the massages. She still plans to go without him. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author made a decision based on available options: male and female masseuses. She assigned each of them to the opposite gender. Her boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse, citing that massages are sexual. He's upset and refuses to go, while the author tries to understand his reasoning and even offers to switch. She ends up going without him.\n\nIs the author wrong for scheduling him with a male masseuse? Well, she didn't know he had this issue beforehand. She chose based on availability, maybe assuming it's about gender balance. But she might not have considered his possible discomfort. However, she did offer to switch after he expressed his feelings. He didn't want to switch, so she still went. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's reasoning is that massages are inherently sexual. That seems a bit odd, as massages are typically seen as therapeutic. But people can have personal boundaries or beliefs. However, his reaction seems harsh\u2014calling her irrational and making it an argument. He also cancels the plans, which could be seen as avoiding the situation.\n\nThe author's intention was to do what she thought was the natural thing, but she didn't know his feelings beforehand. She tried to explain and compromise. The boyfriend's response might be more problematic, as he's not open to discussion and is making it a big deal. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not knowing his preference? Maybe she should have asked beforehand. However, in some cases, people assume that shared activities can be done with same or opposite gender staff unless specified. If the boyfriend had a strong aversion, maybe he should have communicated that earlier. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had a duty to know about his discomfort. Since she didn't, and he didn't mention it before booking, it's possible she's not at fault. However, maybe she should have checked in to see if he had any preferences. But in the absence of prior knowledge, it's hard to say she's wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He's dismissing her reasoning, accusing her of making it up, and refusing to switch. His behavior could be more problematic. The author tried to resolve it by offering to switch, but he didn't accept. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have acted without knowing his preferences, she tried to address the issue once he raised it. The boyfriend's response is more rigid and confrontational. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B (No).\n"
