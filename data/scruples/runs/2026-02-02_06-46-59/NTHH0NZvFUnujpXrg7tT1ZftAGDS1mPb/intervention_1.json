A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they were planning to get massages together, and she chose the male masseuse for him and the female for herself. He's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and refuses to go with a male masseuse. She tried to discuss it, but he got defensive, called her arguments irrational, and suggested canceling. She's still going without him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to split the masseuses based on gender, which she might have thought was fair or comfortable. Her boyfriend, however, has a strong discomfort with male masseuses due to the perceived sexual aspect. Even though they're in a monogamous relationship, his personal boundaries are being triggered here. \n\nShe tried to engage in a discussion to understand his reasoning, which is a healthy approach. But he dismissed her efforts, labeled her as irrational, and refused to compromise beyond canceling. His reaction seems extreme and maybe dismissive of her efforts to understand. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by not considering his feelings beforehand. Maybe she should have discussed the masseuse's gender with him first instead of making the decision unilaterally. However, she did offer to switch, showing willingness to accommodate. \n\nThe key points are: Did she have the right to make that choice without consulting him? Possibly not, but she did offer a solution. His reaction was confrontational and closed-minded. So, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the author. But she could have handled it better by checking with him first. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong (option B) because she made an effort to adjust and he was inflexible. But there's a nuance\u2014maybe she should have communicated better initially. However, since she did offer to switch and he refused, the main issue is his response. So the answer could be B.\n"
