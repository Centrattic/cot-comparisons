  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation involves a planned couples massage, where the author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend then objects, saying massages are inherently sexual and he won't accept a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning but he refused, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's action was based on practicality\u2014there were male and female masseuses available, so she assigned them accordingly. She didn't know her boyfriend's preference beforehand. The boyfriend's objection is about his personal discomfort, viewing massages as sexual. He feels the author is pushing his boundaries by not accommodating his request, even after she offered to switch. \n\nKey points: Did the author have a right to assume the massage was non-sexual? The boyfriend's stance is personal and possibly based on his own views. The author tried to understand and offered solutions. The boyfriend's refusal might be about his comfort and boundaries. \n\nThe author's intention wasn't to be dismissive but to understand. However, she might not have considered his feelings beforehand. But since she didn't know his stance, it's not her fault. The boyfriend's refusal to switch after she offered could indicate he's being inflexible. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her action was respectful of his boundaries. She didn't know his preference, so it's not her fault. She also tried to resolve it. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, as he's not willing to adjust even after she offered. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
