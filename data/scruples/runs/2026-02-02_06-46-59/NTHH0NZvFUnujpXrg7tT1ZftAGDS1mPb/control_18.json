A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author scheduled her boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset because he thinks massages are inherently sexual and doesn't want a man to do it. She tried to discuss it and understand his reasoning, but he got defensive and said she was arguing. She even offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to plan a joint massage, choosing based on available options. She didn't know her boyfriend's preference, which might be a valid point. He's uncomfortable because he sees massages as sexual, which is his personal belief. But is that a valid reason to refuse? Or is he overreacting?\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to accommodate by switching masseuses, showing she's trying to be respectful. He dismissed her efforts and decided to cancel, which could be seen as inflexible. The author went ahead without him, which might show she's standing by her decision, but maybe she should have considered his feelings more.\n\nBut then, respecting someone's boundaries is important. If he's uncomfortable, she should honor that. However, she didn't know beforehand. Maybe she should have asked his preference before booking. But since she tried to switch, maybe she's made an effort.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author made an assumption based on available options, which led to conflict. She tried to resolve it by switching, but he refused. His reaction might be overblown, but his discomfort is real. The author's persistence might be seen as pushing her choice despite his feelings. However, she's also trying to understand his reasoning, which is good. The question is whether her initial action was wrong. Since she didn't know his preference and tried to adjust, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she ignored his feelings after he expressed them, that's another issue.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the answer depends on whether the author's action was respectful. She tried to accommodate, so maybe she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be more at fault here. So the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
