A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about scheduling a massage for the boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's upset about it. The user (the author) is a woman planning a massage with her boyfriend, and she chose the male masseuse for him. He then gets upset, saying massages are inherently sexual and refuses to go. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, offered to switch, but he ended up not wanting to go at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that massages are therapeutic, so she thought it was okay. She wanted to understand his discomfort. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels that masses with someone of the opposite sex is inherently sexual, so he's uncomfortable with a male masseuse. But wait, he's the one with the male masseuse. Wait, the author is a woman, and she booked her boyfriend (who is male) with a male masseuse? Wait, no, the user is female. So the boyfriend is male, and she booked him with a male masseuse. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nThe user is a woman (21/F) and her boyfriend is male (M/21). They both wanted massages. She booked the male boyfriend with a male masseuse and herself with a female one. So the boyfriend is male, and the masseuse is also male. So the issue is about the male boyfriend getting a massage from a male masseuse. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Why would he be uncomfortable with a male masseuse? Unless there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the boyfriend thought it was a female masseuse? Or maybe there's a different reason.\n\nWait, the user says the boyfriend says massages are inherently sexual. So he's implying that having any opposite-sex masseuse is sexual. But in this case, the boyfriend is male and the masseuse is male. So why is he uncomfortable? Unless there's a typo here. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the scenario. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal scenario: The user is female, her boyfriend is male. They both planned to get massages. The available options were a male and a female masseuse. The user booked her boyfriend with the male masseuse and herself with the female. Then the boyfriend objects and says he won't let a man massage him. Wait, he's male, so the masseuse is male. That should be same-sex, right? So why is he objecting? That seems odd. Unless there's a mistake in the scenario. Or maybe the user meant that she booked the male masseuse for herself and the female for her boyfriend? That would make more sense if he's a male and uncomfortable with a female masseuse. But according to the user's statement, she booked her boyfriend (male) with the male masseuse. So the masseuse is male, same as his gender. So why is he uncomfortable? That seems contradictory. Maybe the user made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, maybe the boyfriend is transgender or non-binary, but that's not indicated. Wait, the user says the boyfriend is M/21, so male.\n\nThis is confusing because if the boyfriend is male and the masseuse is male, then it's same-sex. So why is he uncomfortable? That suggests maybe there's a misunderstanding or a typo. Perhaps the user intended to book the female masseuse for the boyfriend and the male for herself, but accidentally did the opposite. If that's the case, then the boyfriend's discomfort would make sense if he's uncomfortable with same-sex masseuses. But the scenario as written says the user booked the male masseuse for the male boyfriend. That's the key point here.\n\nAssuming the scenario is correct as written, the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse. But since he's male, the masseuse is male. That seems odd unless he has a specific issue with male masseuses. Maybe he has some personal boundaries or past experiences. The user tried to discuss and offered to switch, but he refused. The user then went ahead without him.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, she scheduled the massage without considering his comfort. Even if she thought the logic was irrational, pushing for it when he's explicitly uncomfortable could be seen as not respecting his boundaries. However, she did offer to switch. But he didn't want to switch either. The key is whether the user overstepped by scheduling the massage without his input, or if she was within her rights to make the booking, given that it was for both of them. But since massages are personal, maybe the user should have asked his preference instead of assuming. If the boyfriend has a valid reason for being uncomfortable, even if the user thinks it's irrational, respecting his boundaries is important. So the user might be in the wrong for not considering his feelings and pushing the issue instead of backing off once he expressed discomfort.\n\nAlternatively, if the scenario is actually a typo (maybe the user meant to book the female masseuse for the boyfriend and male for herself, but got it mixed up), then the analysis would be different. But based on the text provided, we have to take it at face value. The user scheduled her male boyfriend with a male masseuse, and he's uncomfortable. The user tried to discuss and offered to switch, but he refused. So the user's actions might be in the wrong because she didn't respect his initial discomfort and continued to argue instead of backing down once he said it's an issue. Even if she thought his reasoning was irrational, forcing the issue could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. However, the user also tried to understand his reasoning. The boyfriend's refusal to switch after the offer is his choice. But the user's initial scheduling without asking his preference could be the problem. So maybe the answer is A (the user is in the wrong) because she didn't consider his boundaries and pushed the issue despite his discomfort.\n"
