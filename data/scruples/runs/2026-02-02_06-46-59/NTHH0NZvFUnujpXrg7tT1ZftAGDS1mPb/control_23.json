  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for scheduling my boyfriend with a male masseuse?\nMy boyfriend and I planned on getting massages together. A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for booking her boyfriend with a male masseuse. The situation is that they planned to get massages together, and she scheduled them with a male and female masseuse. The boyfriend then refuses, saying massages are inherently sexual. The author is trying to understand his reasoning and even offers to switch, but he wants to cancel.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to split the massages based on the available masseuse genders, which might have been a practical choice. But the boyfriend is uncomfortable with a male masseuse because he views massages as sexual. He's in a monogamous relationship, so maybe he feels that any opposite-sex interaction, even professional, is inappropriate. \n\nThe author tried to discuss and understand his perspective, which is a good sign. She even offered to switch, showing she's trying to accommodate his comfort. However, he insists on canceling, which suggests he's not open to compromise beyond his initial choice. \n\nIs the author wrong for making the booking? Well, she didn't know his preference beforehand. It's possible she assumed splitting by gender was normal. But when he expressed discomfort, she attempted to address it. His refusal might stem from personal beliefs, but the author isn't forcing him; she's allowing him to cancel. The key here is whether her initial action was wrong. Since she made a decision without considering his possible discomfort, maybe she should have checked with him first. However, since they were doing it together, perhaps it's a shared decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's stance that massages are sexual might be a personal issue. The author is trying to rationalize it as therapeutic, which is reasonable. But if he's uncomfortable, even if his reasoning is flawed, she should respect that. However, she did try to switch, so she's being accommodating. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author is at fault for not considering his feelings upfront. But since she made an effort to resolve it once he expressed discomfort, maybe she's not entirely wrong. The boyfriend's refusal to switch and wanting to cancel could be his own rigidity. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she tried to accommodate his needs after he expressed discomfort, and his own stance might be the root issue here.\n"
