A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who scheduled the boyfriend with a male masseuse) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple wanted massages together. The author chose a male masseuse for her boyfriend and a female for herself. The boyfriend is uncomfortable because he thinks massages are inherently sexual, so he doesn't want a male masseuse. The author tried to discuss and understand his reasoning, but he accused her of being irrational and making it up. She tried to switch, but he wanted to cancel. She's going ahead without him.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe key points here are about respecting boundaries and communication. The boyfriend expressed discomfort with male masseuses, possibly due to his personal beliefs or experiences. The author made a decision without considering his feelings. Even though she tried to switch later, the initial action of booking him with a male masseuse might have disregarded his comfort. \n\nBut wait, why did she do that? She might have thought it was fair since they're both in a relationship and wanted to go together. However, if he has a strong aversion, maybe she should have asked first. The fact that he felt it was a big deal and wanted to cancel suggests that the decision caused significant discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to discuss and understand his reasoning. She tried to switch and still went, which shows she's making an effort. But the initial decision could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's argument that massages are inherently sexual is a bit odd, especially in a monogamous relationship. But that's his belief. The author's pushing to understand might have come off as arguing, even if she meant to debate. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong: the author didn't consider her boyfriend's feelings upfront, leading to conflict. Even if she tried to resolve it later, the initial action might be where the issue started. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries from the start. \n\nBut another angle is that the boyfriend's reasoning is irrational, so maybe the author's right to question that. But in relationships, respecting each other's comfort levels is important. So perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't take his feelings into account initially.\n"
