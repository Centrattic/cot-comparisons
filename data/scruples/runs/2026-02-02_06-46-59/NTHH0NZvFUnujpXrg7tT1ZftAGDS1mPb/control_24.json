A male and female masseuse were available, so I booked him (M/21) with the male and me (21/F) with the female. When I tell him about this, he says he will never let a man massage him. He explains that its because massages are inherently sexual. I believe massages are purely therapeutic so I try to discuss this and understand why he believes they are sexual and if he believes this, why it's then acceptable to even get a massage from the opposite sex in the first place since we are in a monogamous relationship. He says my opinion is irrational and I'm making it up just to argue- massages are clearly somewhat sexual and that I'm wrong for pushing for something he is uncomfortable with and turning it into an argument. I kept trying to explain I just wanted to understand his logic and hear his reasonings- kind of like a debate.  I even offered to switch masseuses. He then says to just cancel his massages and that this is too much trouble. I'm still going to go without him even after all this. AITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for scheduling her boyfriend with a male masseuse.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend planned to get massages together. The options were a male or female masseuse, so she assigned her boyfriend to the male and herself to the female. When she informed him, he refused because he finds massages inherently sexual with men and is uncomfortable with male masseurs. She tried to discuss his reasoning, suggesting it's irrational and wanted to understand his logic. He felt she was pushing his discomfort and turning it into an argument. She offered to switch, but he wanted to cancel his appointment.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are consent and comfort. The author didn't know about his discomfort beforehand. She made a choice based on available options. When she learned his objection, she tried to engage in discussion and even offered a solution. However, he felt she was being argumentative. The question is whether her actions were wrong.\n\nFrom a perspective of respect and communication, the author tried to address his concerns. It's possible that she should have checked in with him before booking, but she didn't know his preference initially. His reaction might be based on his personal boundaries, which she tried to honor. However, he's dismissing her reasoning and not engaging constructively. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention wasn't malicious. She wanted to facilitate the activity they both agreed on. He has the right to his comfort level, but his response seems dismissive and rigid. The author's actions, while perhaps not the best approach, don't seem to be in the wrong. She made an effort to resolve the issue, so the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
