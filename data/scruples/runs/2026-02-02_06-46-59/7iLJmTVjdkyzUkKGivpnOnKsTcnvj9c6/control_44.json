All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the scenario did something wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a guy named \"M 18\" who was in a group chat with friends discussing lacrosse. His friend made a comment about him sounding like a bitch, and M 18 responded by making a joke about the friend's weight and gym. Then the friend made a joke about M 18's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo, has lupus, and is swollen from kidney issues. The friend's comment was about her weight, which was actually due to her medical condition. M 18 told his friend he went too far, but the friend dismissed it. Now M 18 is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom, but he's unsure if that's the right move.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering sending the screenshot. The options are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a comment that was not only disrespectful but also insensitivity to M 18's girlfriend's medical condition. The friend showed no remorse. M 18 was trying to avoid escalating things in front of other friends and is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a way to address the issue. The friends are caught in the middle.\n\nNow, is M 18 in the wrong for wanting to send the screenshot? Well, let's look at both sides. On one hand, the friend's comment was inappropriate and hurtful, especially given the context of the girlfriend's health. M 18 is trying to protect his girlfriend's feelings and hold the friend accountable. On the other hand, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of revenge or escalation that wasn't agreed upon by others. However, the friend showed no remorse and M 18 might feel that this is the only way to address the issue, given that the other friends aren't taking sides.\n\nIn terms of moral and ethical considerations, the friend's comment was clearly wrong. The act of reporting the comment to a parent might be seen as a way to get the friend to understand the seriousness of his words. However, some might argue that M 18 should handle it directly with his friend or involve mutual friends instead of going to the parents. But given that the friend is unrepentant and the comment was about a vulnerable person's health condition, M 18's action could be justified as a form of protection and advocacy for his girlfriend.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences. Sending the screenshot could lead to the friend's parents being involved, which might result in the friend facing repercussions. This could be seen as a necessary step if the friend is unresponsive to direct confrontation. However, it's also possible that this action could damage the friendship and cause further conflict. But given the friend's attitude, M 18 might feel that this is the only way to address the issue.\n\nIn some contexts, people might argue that M 18 is overreacting or that he should handle it privately. However, considering the medical context of his girlfriend and the friend's lack of remorse, it's more about protecting someone who is in a vulnerable situation. The act of sharing the screenshot could serve as evidence of the friend's inappropriate behavior, which might prevent future incidents. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, it seems that M 18's intention is to address a hurtful comment that was made at the expense of his girlfriend's health. The action of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom might be a way to hold the friend accountable, especially when other methods have failed. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
