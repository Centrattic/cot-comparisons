All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition. The author tried to respond, but the friend escalated it. Now, the author is contemplating sharing the conversation with the friend's mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's behavior is clearly inappropriate and cruel. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially in a public group chat, is inconsiderate and harmful. The author's girlfriend is vulnerable due to her health, so the friend's comments are not just a joke but potentially harmful.\n\nNow, the author's response is to send a screenshot to the friend's mom. This action could be seen as a form of taking the high road by involving a parent to address the issue. However, it's also a private matter. Depending on the context, if the author has tried to address it directly and the friend isn't remorseful, involving the parent might be a way to hold the friend accountable. \n\nBut, some might argue that the author is using a parent's intervention as a way to escalate the conflict without giving the friend a chance to own up. Alternatively, the author might feel that this is the only way to protect his girlfriend's feelings and address the friend's lack of empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, sending the screenshot could lead to unintended consequences for the friend's family and might not be the best approach. The author could have other options, like confronting the friend again, blocking him, or seeking support from others. However, given the friend's dismissive attitude, the author might feel justified in taking this step.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action is a response to a violation of trust and respect. While it's a personal choice, the initial harm came from the friend's comments. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to address the issue through this method, especially if other avenues have failed.\n"
