All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a derogatory comment about his girlfriend who has health issues, and the author considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with serious health problems (chemo, lupus, kidney issues). The joke is cruel and shows no empathy. The author is angry and wants to retaliate by sending the screenshot to the friend's mother, possibly to expose the friend's behavior. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if others agree. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nNow, considering the morality here. The friend clearly crossed a line by making a joke at the expense of someone's serious health struggles. That's inexcusable. The author's reaction is to expose the friend's comment to his mom. While this might seem like a form of revenge, it's a way to hold the friend accountable. However, sending the screenshot without the friend's consent could be seen as invading his privacy or escalating the conflict in a way that might not be productive. \n\nBut wait, the friend's comment was about a vulnerable person, and the author is trying to protect their partner by confronting the friend, albeit in a private manner. The alternative is letting the friend off the hook since others in the group are hesitant. The author's action is driven by anger and a desire for justice for their girlfriend. \n\nIs exposing the comment to the friend's mom the right way? It might be harsh, but considering the friend's lack of remorse (\"Don't talk shit then\"), maybe it's necessary to make him face consequences. However, sending a screenshot without context could be misleading. But in this case, the comment is pretty clear in its cruelty. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends aren't stepping up, so they're acting alone. The question is whether the author's action is justified. If the friend's comment was a one-time joke, maybe the author overreacts. But given the girlfriend's health issues, the joke is deeply hurtful. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but morally, it's a gray area. The author is using a personal relationship to enforce accountability, which might not be the best approach, but the friend's behavior was inexcusable. \n\nSo, the author is trying to right a wrong done to their partner. While the method might not be ideal, the intent is to protect someone being targeted. The friend's behavior is clearly worse. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But is the action itself wrong? \n\nIf the answer is A (author is wrong), then the reasoning would be that the author is resorting to revenge, which isn't acceptable. But if the answer is B (not wrong), it's because the friend's actions were worse, and the author is defending their partner. \n\nI think it's a tough call, but since the friend's comment was so harmful and the author is trying to hold him accountable, even if the method is questionable, the author's intent is to protect their girlfriend. So maybe the answer is B. However, I should also consider that sending the screenshot could be seen as a privacy violation. But given the context, maybe it's justified. So I'm leaning towards B.\n"
