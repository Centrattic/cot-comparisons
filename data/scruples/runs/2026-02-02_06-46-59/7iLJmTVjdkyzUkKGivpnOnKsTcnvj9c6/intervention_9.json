All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment about their girlfriend, who's going through chemo, to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the girlfriend's condition, which is really sensitive. The author was angry and wanted to respond. Instead of confronting the friend directly, they decided to send the screenshot to his mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, is it right to involve the friend's mom here? On one hand, the friend's comment was hurtful and targeted someone vulnerable. The author might feel that their friend isn't taking it seriously and needs consequences. But sending the screenshot without telling them could be seen as a betrayal or escalation. It's a private conversation, and sharing it without consent can damage trust, even if the original comment was wrong.\n\nBut the other side: the friend showed no remorse, and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings. Maybe they felt that confronting the friend directly wouldn't work, so they needed another approach. However, the right way to handle it might have been to speak to the friend's mom in person or via a call, not just sending a screenshot that could be taken out of context. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they often help the friend hide things from his parents. If they usually do that, then this might be a betrayal of that trust. But the friend's actions here were particularly harmful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The friend's comment was definitely wrong, but the method of addressing it might have been inappropriate. The author's action could harm their friendship and family relationships, but it's done out of concern. Maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because the approach is unwise and escalates things without a direct confrontation first. But some might say B because the friend's comment was so offensive.\n"
