All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment about his girlfriend undergoing chemo to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend made a cruel joke targeting the author's girlfriend, who's battling serious health issues. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014this was a personal attack. The friend showed no remorse, which adds to the tension. The author is considering escalating by sharing the offensive message with the friend's mom. \n\nNow, the key points. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a hurtful remark about someone with a medical condition. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so the joke is particularly insensitive. The author tried to address it directly, but the friend dismissed it. The group chat environment complicates things, as others are present but not taking sides.\n\nIs sending the screenshot to the mom the right move? On one hand, it's a form of confrontation that might help involve a parent to intervene. On the other hand, it's a privacy breach and could escalate the conflict. The author mentions that they and others often help the friend hide things from his parents, implying a history of covering for him. This could mean the author is now acting against a pattern, which might be justified given the severity of the comment.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But considering the context\u2014the friend's lack of remorse, the severity of the insult, and the girlfriend's medical condition\u2014it's possible the author is acting in self-defense to protect their partner. However, using a parent as an intervention might not be the most appropriate step. The author could consider other methods, like involving a mutual friend or an authority figure, instead of directly involving the parent. \n\nBut since the author's intention is to stop the friend's harmful behavior and the friend has shown no remorse, the action might be seen as a necessary step to protect their girlfriend's well-being. The moral dilemma here is about the means versus the ends. The ends (stopping cruelty) are good, but the means (involving the parent without consent) is ethically questionable. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the friend's comment is definitely wrong. The author's action is a response to that. However, the author's decision to share it with the mom might be a breach of the friend's privacy. But given the severity of the comment and the girlfriend's health issues, some might argue it's justified as a protective measure. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. If the author's goal is to prevent further harm and the friend has shown no willingness to change, then the action might be seen as necessary. However, it's still a breach of trust and could have unintended consequences. But in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't the one who made the offensive comment. The friend is clearly in the wrong. The author's action is a response, and while it's not the most conventional approach, it's driven by a desire to protect their girlfriend. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
