All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke about their girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, which caused her physical symptoms like swelling. The author responded to the friend's initial rude comment, which led to a back-and-forth. The friend then made a joke about the author's girlfriend's weight. The author is considering sending this exchange to the friend's mom because the friend showed no remorse, and they don't want to escalate it in front of other friends who are unsure how to act.\n\nNow, the key points here are the friend's inappropriate comments targeting the author's girlfriend's medical condition and the author's possible retaliation by involving the friend's parent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comments were clearly hurtful and insensitive towards someone with a serious illness. The author has a valid reason to be upset and might feel that the friend isn't taking the situation seriously. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's an attempt to shame or punish the friend. However, the author might see it as a necessary step to protect their girlfriend's feelings and to address the friend's lack of remorse.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. While the author's actions might be morally questionable (since confronting the friend directly or involving others might be better), the context is important. The friend's behavior was harmful, and the author might feel like they're out of options. The author's intent is to address the friend's behavior, which was inconsiderate and cruel.\n\nBut is sending it to the mom the right approach? It depends on the situation. If the author is using it as a way to teach the friend a lesson or to get his mom involved to correct his behavior, maybe they're trying to do the right thing. However, bypassing the friend and involving his parent without giving him a chance to apologize might be seen as overstepping. But given that the friend showed no remorse and the comments were about a vulnerable person, the author might feel justified.\n\nIn ethical discussions, actions are often judged based on intent and consequences. The author's intent is to address an offensive comment made about someone with a serious illness. The consequence could be that the friend's parent is made aware, leading to a discussion about his behavior. However, it could also escalate tensions or create conflicts that weren't there before.\n\nIn some cases, involving a parent might be appropriate if the friend is a minor, as parents have a role in their child's behavior. The author is 18, so the friend might also be a minor. If that's the case, the parent's involvement could be justified. But if the friend is an adult, it's a different scenario. The original question mentions the author is 18, so the friend is likely around the same age, possibly underage.\n\nGiven that, the author might be within their rights to involve the parent if they believe it's necessary to address harmful behavior. The alternative is that the author is in the wrong for violating the friend's privacy by sending the screenshot. However, the content of the screenshot involves a serious issue affecting the author's girlfriend, which could outweigh privacy concerns.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions could be seen as a justified response to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's inconsiderate behavior, even if it's a harsh method. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
