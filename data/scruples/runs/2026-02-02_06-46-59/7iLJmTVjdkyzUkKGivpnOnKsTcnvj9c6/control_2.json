All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a joke about their girlfriend's health issues, and the author considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend made a comment that was clearly derogatory towards the author's girlfriend, who has serious health problems. The author responded, then the friend escalated with a joke about the girlfriend's weight, which is related to her medical condition. The author's reaction is to consider sending a screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation. They also mention that they usually help cover for this friend's issues with his parents.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend's comments were inappropriate and targeted someone with a serious illness. The author is upset and wants to take action but is conflicted about it. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (author isn't wrong).\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the author's friend made a cruel joke about a person's health, which is inexcusable. On the other hand, the author's response is to retaliate by exposing the friend's comment to his mom, which could be seen as a breach of privacy or escalation. However, the friend's comment was hurtful and shows a lack of empathy. The author might be trying to address this without confrontation in front of others.\n\nBut is sending the screenshot a justified action? The author is trying to hold the friend accountable without further confrontation. However, the method might be harsh. But given the context of the friend's insensitive remarks, some might argue it's a valid response to make him face the consequences through his parents.\n\nAlternatively, the author could have other options like confronting the friend more directly or seeking support from other friends. But they mention that other friends are hesitant. The author's intention is to address the friend's inappropriate behavior, which is important, especially given the girlfriend's serious health issues.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action of sending the screenshot is wrong. The friend's initial comment was definitely inappropriate, and the author is trying to address it. However, exposing it to the friend's mom could be seen as a violation of trust or an overreaction. It's a gray area. But considering the context of the friend's cruel joke about a vulnerable person, some might argue that the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were inexcusable, and the author is trying to address it, albeit through a questionable method. However, others might say the author is wrong to escalate things by involving parents without a direct confrontation first. But given the situation, the friend's behavior was worse, so the author's action might be justified as a form of accountability. So the answer is B.\n"
