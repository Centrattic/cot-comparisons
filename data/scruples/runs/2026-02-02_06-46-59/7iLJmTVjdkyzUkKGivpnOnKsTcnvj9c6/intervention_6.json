All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful, targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition. The author tried to confront the friend, but he dismissed it, showing no remorse. The author is now considering escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom, possibly to get him into trouble. \n\nNow, the key points here are the friend's behavior versus the author's response. The friend's joke is malicious and shows a lack of empathy, especially given the girlfriend's condition. However, the author's action of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as retaliation. The question is whether that retaliation is justified.\n\nThe author argues that they're not escalating in front of others and that their friends haven't taken sides. The friend's behavior is indeed inexcusable, but the author's response bypasses direct confrontation and instead uses a third party. This might not be the most constructive approach, as it could harm their friendship and potentially lead to more conflict.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the friend's ongoing disrespect and lack of remorse, the author might feel that this is a necessary step to hold the friend accountable. The morality here is tricky. The friend's actions are clearly wrong, but the author's method of addressing it could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's done without giving the friend a chance to apologize or take responsibility.\n\nIn many cases, involving a parent is a common way to address someone's behavior, but it can also be perceived as tattling or being vindictive. The author's motivation is understandable, given the severity of the friend's comment, but the method might not be the most appropriate. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and the girlfriend, and maintaining a respectful approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's actions are inexcusable, the author's decision to involve the parent might be seen as the lesser of two evils, given the context. However, it's a gray area. The author might be in the wrong in terms of the method, but the intent is to protect their girlfriend from further harm. Still, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because using a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a personal attack rather than a constructive resolution.\n"
