All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has health issues causing her to be swollen and bloated. The friend's insult was about her weight, which is directly related to her medical condition. The author tried to respond in a joking manner, but the friend escalated it. The author then sent a screenshot to the friend's mom to get them to stop, rather than confronting him directly in front of others.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's medical situation. The author was trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings and prevent further harassment. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom without his consent might be seen as escalating the situation in a different way. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The friend's behavior was inappropriate, and the author had a right to be upset. But the method of response\u2014using a screenshot and involving the friend's mother\u2014could be seen as bypassing direct communication. However, the author's intent was to stop the bullying, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of privacy. The group chat was a private space, and sharing that content without permission could invade the friend's privacy. However, given the context of the cruel comment targeting someone vulnerable, some might argue it's justified as a form of accountability. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have addressed the friend directly, maybe in private, or involved mutual friends to mediate. But the author mentions that the friend showed no remorse, so perhaps direct confrontation wouldn't have worked. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, the author's action was a response to harassment. While the method is questionable, the intent was protective. However, the action itself might be considered a breach of trust. \n\nI think the key here is whether the harm caused by the friend's comment outweighs the harm of the author's response. Since the friend's comment was targeting someone in a vulnerable state, the author's action might be seen as necessary to stop the bullying. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a balance here. \n\nBut wait, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), then the author isn't wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), then they are. Considering the context, the friend's comment was the real problem, and the author's response was an attempt to address it. However, sharing personal messages without consent is generally considered wrong, even if the intent is good. The line between standing up for someone and violating privacy is thin. \n\nSo, there's a conflict here. The action might be understandable but not ethically correct. Depending on cultural or personal values, some might say the author is justified, others not. But given that the comment was about a medical condition and weight, which are sensitive topics, the author's action was to protect their girlfriend's dignity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the method is debatable, the intent was to prevent further harm. However, the action itself (sharing private messages) is generally considered wrong. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they violated the friend's privacy, even with good intentions. But others might argue B because the friend was in the wrong first. Hmm. This is tricky.\n"
