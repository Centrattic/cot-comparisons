All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend made a really hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author responds by threatening to send a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were about the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with serious health problems. The friend's joke was not just rude but potentially cruel, given the girlfriend's medical conditions. The author is clearly upset and wants to retaliate because the friend showed no remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is justified. On one hand, the friend's behavior was inappropriate and hurtful. The author might feel that this is a way to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend isn't taking responsibility. On the other hand, the author is taking a private conversation and sharing it with someone else (the mom) without the friend's consent. That could be seen as a breach of privacy or an escalation of the conflict.\n\nBut I should also consider the severity of the friend's actions. Making fun of someone's serious health issues is not just a minor joke. It's a personal attack that can cause emotional harm. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so the friend's comment was particularly insensitive. The author might feel that the usual social repercussions aren't enough, especially since the friend isn't showing any remorse.\n\nThe author is also concerned about escalating things in front of other friends who are neutral. By taking the action of sending the screenshot to the mom, the author might be trying to handle the situation without public confrontation. However, this could backfire if the mom reacts strongly or if the friend feels betrayed by their friends helping hide things from parents.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the friend's actions were indeed that harmful, then the author's response could be seen as a form of seeking justice for their girlfriend. However, the method of doing so by involving a parent might not be the best approach. It's a private matter and could lead to unintended consequences. The author might be justified in feeling angry, but using a screenshot as leverage could be seen as a violation of trust if the original conversation was meant to be among friends.\n\nBut considering the context of the friend's comment, the author's action might be a proportional response to address the harm caused. The key point is whether the author's action is an appropriate way to handle the situation. Since the friend has no remorse and the comment was about a sensitive topic, the author might feel that traditional methods of addressing it (like talking to the friend) aren't effective. \n\nIn summary, while the friend's behavior was clearly wrong, the author's response might be crossing a line by involving the parent. However, given the seriousness of the friend's comment, the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to prevent further harm. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of the friendship. In many cases, escalating to a parent might be considered a last resort when other measures fail. Since the friend showed no remorse and the comment was about a serious health issue, the author's action might be understandable, even if not the most advisable. So, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
