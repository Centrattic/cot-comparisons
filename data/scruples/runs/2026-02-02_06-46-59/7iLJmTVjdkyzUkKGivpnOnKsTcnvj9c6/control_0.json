All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's comment was extremely insensitive, targeting someone who's already vulnerable. The author tried to confront the friend, but the friend showed no remorse. Now the author is considering escalating by sending the screenshot to his mom. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for doing that. The friend's behavior is clearly inappropriate and harmful. The author's girlfriend is in a serious medical situation, so the joke is not just mean but also shows a lack of empathy. The author might feel justified in wanting to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend is dismissive.\n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to his mom could be seen as a form of retaliation. It's bypassing the friend and involving his parent, which might not be the best approach. But given the context of the friend's comment, the author's actions could be seen as a reasonable response to protect their girlfriend and ensure the friend understands the severity of his words.\n\nOn the other hand, using a screenshot to involve parents might not be the most mature solution. The author could have other options, like reporting through appropriate channels or discussing with mutual friends. But considering the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the joke, the author might feel that direct action is necessary.\n\nIn terms of morality and right vs. wrong, the line is blurry. The friend's behavior is clearly wrong, but the author's response might be seen as crossing a line too. However, given the context of the situation and the friend's lack of accountability, some might argue the author is justified. Others might say it's a poor choice because it could lead to more conflict or not address the underlying issue.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key points are the insensitivity of the friend's comment, the author's attempt to address it, and the friend's nonchalant response. The author's action is a form of confronting the issue, albeit privately. Since the friend isn't taking responsibility, the author might feel they have no better options. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be \"No\" (B), the author isn't in the wrong, because the friend's actions were harmful and the author is trying to address it, even if the method is questionable. However, there's a nuance here. The author's action might not be the best approach, but they aren't entirely in the wrong given the circumstances.\n"
