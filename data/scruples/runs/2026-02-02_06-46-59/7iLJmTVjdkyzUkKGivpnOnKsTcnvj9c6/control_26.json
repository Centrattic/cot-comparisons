All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend making a joke about his girlfriend's chemo to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a comment in a group chat that was clearly offensive and insensitive. The friend joked about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues, in a derogatory way. The author tried to respond but was dismissed by the friend who showed no remorse.\n\nNow, the author is considering sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom. The question is whether this action makes the author wrong. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the friend's comments were clearly inappropriate. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially when it's severe and life-threatening, is a serious issue. The friend showed no empathy, which adds to the problem. \n\nHowever, the author's response is to involve the friend's mom. This could be seen as a form of retaliation or escalation. But given the context of the friend's repeated insensitivity and lack of remorse, the author might feel that this is a justified action to hold the friend accountable. \n\nBut then, there's also the aspect of privacy and trust. The author is using a screenshot to expose the friend's behavior to his mother, which could damage the friend's reputation or cause embarrassment. This could be considered a breach of trust, especially if the group chat was supposed to be a private space. \n\nHowever, considering the severity of the friend's comments and the fact that he showed no remorse, the author might believe that this is a necessary step to address the harm done and prevent further insults. The author's girlfriend is vulnerable due to her health, so defending her honor could be a priority.\n\nOn the other hand, sending the screenshot might not be the most constructive approach. It could lead to conflict with the friend and his family, potentially damaging relationships beyond just the friend. There might be better ways to address the issue, like confronting the friend directly or seeking support from mutual friends.\n\nBut given the friend's dismissive attitude (\"Don't talk shit then\"), the author might not see a resolution through direct conversation. The author also mentions that the friend's mom is someone they've hidden things from before, implying that the friend might not take responsibility if confronted in front of others.\n\nSo, weighing the insensitivity of the friend's actions against the author's response. The friend's comments were harmful and inconsiderate. The author's action, while potentially harsh, could be seen as a justified defense of their partner's dignity. \n\nBut is it morally right to expose someone's private messages to their parent without consent? That's a gray area. However, in this context, the friend's behavior was malicious, so the author's action might be viewed as a necessary step to hold the friend accountable.\n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong because the friend's actions were the initial wrongdoing. The author's response, while possibly extreme, is a reaction to serious insensitivity and lack of remorse.\n"
