All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who has a serious medical condition. The author tried to respond in a playful way at first, but the friend escalated with a harmful comment. The author then confronted the friend, who showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering taking a screenshot of the conversation to send to the friend's mom as a form of accountability.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the friend's comments were insensitive and crossed a line, especially given the girlfriend's health issues. The author might feel that this is a necessary action to make the friend understand the severity of his actions. On the other hand, sharing private messages without consent can invade someone's privacy and potentially escalate the conflict. \n\nHowever, given the context, the friend's behavior was malicious and the author is trying to address it without involving others unnecessarily. The friends in the group chat haven't taken a side yet, and the author is seeking a way to make the friend realize his mistake without public confrontation. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be a way to involve a parent as an authority figure to correct the behavior. \n\nBut is the author wrong for doing this? It's a judgment call. While the method is questionable, the intent is to address a harmful comment. The line between taking a stand and crossing into privacy violation is thin here. However, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the joke, some might argue the author isn't in the wrong. Others might say that the author should've handled it differently, like reporting it or talking directly to the friend's parents in person. \n\nGiven that the author's action is a form of confronting the issue without escalating to a more public or harsh punishment, and considering the context of the friend's offensive remarks, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The key points are the inconsiderate comment, the friend's refusal to acknowledge it, and the author's attempt to use a private, direct method to address it. While there's a debate, the situation shows the author's justification.\n"
