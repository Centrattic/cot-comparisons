All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 18-year-old male who's upset because his friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The friend's comments were offensive and targeted the girlfriend's health condition. The author wants to take a screenshot of that message and send it to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's joke was not only disrespectful but also hurtful, especially given the girlfriend's medical situation. The friend showed no remorse when confronted, which adds to the severity. The author is frustrated and wants to retaliate by exposing the comment to the friend's parent. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about the action. Sending a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of revenge. Even though the original comment was harmful, the author is using a personal method to address it. It's important to consider if there's a more appropriate way to handle this, like talking to the friend directly or involving a mutual friend, rather than involving parents. However, the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the joke might justify the author's actions as a form of accountability. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, escalating a private issue by involving parents might not be the best approach. It could damage relationships and lead to more conflict. However, the original comment was clearly in the wrong. The author's intent is to hold his friend accountable for a harmful statement. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author is protecting his girlfriend and standing up for her, which is commendable. But the method he's considering could be seen as overstepping, especially if the friend's mom wasn't aware of the context. However, given the friend's lack of remorse, the author might feel that this is necessary to stop further harm.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The friend definitely crossed a line, but the author's response might not be the best solution. However, given the circumstances, the author's actions could be justified as a way to address the friend's inappropriate behavior. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there are nuances here.\n"
