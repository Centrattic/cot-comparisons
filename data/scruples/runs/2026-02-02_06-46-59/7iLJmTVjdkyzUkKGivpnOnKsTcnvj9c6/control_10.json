All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend made a really insensitive comment about his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend called the girlfriend a \"bitch\" and then made a joke about her weight, which is due to her medical condition. The author responded, but the friend doubled down. Now the author is thinking about sending a screenshot of that message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with serious health problems, which makes the friend's comments especially hurtful. The author is trying to protect her partner from this kind of talk. The friend's response shows no remorse, so maybe the author feels like he's not getting through to him otherwise.\n\nBut, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of revenge or escalation. Even if the comment was awful, is it right to expose it to his mom? The author mentions that they all help the friend hide things from his parents, so maybe there's a pattern of secrecy. But in this case, the friend's words were harmful. \n\nOn one hand, the author is defending his girlfriend and trying to hold the friend accountable. On the other hand, confronting the friend's mom might not be the best approach. It could create family issues or backfire. However, the friend's behavior is inexcusable given the context of the girlfriend's health struggles.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable response. Since words can be weaponized, especially when someone is vulnerable, the friend's comments were clearly wrong. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking it seriously, so sending the screenshot to the mom could be a way to make him face the consequences. But it's also possible that the author is acting out of anger and not considering the potential fallout for both sides.\n\nThere's a line between standing up for someone and taking matters into your own hands. The author's girlfriend is going through a tough time, so protecting her is important. However, the method chosen might not be the most appropriate. Maybe reporting the friend or confronting him directly with the group could be better options. But given the friend's lack of remorse, maybe the author feels those options aren't effective.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The friend's comment was offensive and hurtful, especially given the girlfriend's health. The author is trying to protect her, which is understandable. However, the retaliation method might be inappropriate. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If the author's action could lead to the friend understanding the severity of his words, maybe it's justified. But if it's just revenge, then it's wrong.\n\nI'm leaning towards thinking the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's actions were inexcusable, and the author is trying to protect his girlfriend. But I'm not 100% sure. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal ethics. However, in this context, the friend's behavior was particularly cruel, so the author's response, while not ideal, is driven by a desire to support his girlfriend during a difficult time.\n"
