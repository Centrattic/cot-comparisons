All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemotherapy, leading the author to consider sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment is clearly inappropriate and cruel, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author's girlfriend has lupus and is dealing with severe health issues, so the joke is not just a joke but a harmful remark that could be deeply hurtful. The friend shows no remorse and even doubles down by making a joke about the girlfriend's weight, which is a direct attack on her health and vulnerability.\n\nNow, the author is considering escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom. They mention that they and other friends usually cover up things from the friend's parents, but this time they feel justified because of the severity of the comment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking this action.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior is inexcusable. The comment is not just a joke but a serious insult that targets someone who is already suffering. The author has the right to defend their girlfriend and to seek justice or accountability. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom might be considered a breach of trust or an overreaction, even if the friend's behavior was wrong. However, given the context, the author is trying to address a serious issue and prevent further harm. The friends' inaction also plays a role here, as they didn't support the author when the comment was made.\n\nThe key here is the intent. The author is not acting out of malice but in response to a harmful and unwarranted attack. The friend's actions were the initial wrong, and the author is trying to hold them accountable. While escalating the situation might not be the most constructive approach, the underlying issue is the friend's cruelty. So, the author's action, while potentially unwise, is a reaction to a greater wrongdoing. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here, depending on how one views the balance between standing up for someone vulnerable and the method used to address it.\n"
