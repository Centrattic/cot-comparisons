All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has serious health issues. The friend's comment was about her weight and health, which is really sensitive given her medical condition. The author tried to confront the friend, but the friend showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom as a way to address the situation without escalating further in front of other friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The friend's comment was cruel and targeted someone with a serious illness. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable in a way that might not involve their other friends getting involved or things getting worse publicly. They mention that other friends are present but aren't taking sides, and the group usually hides things from parents. The author is conflicted but feels justified because of the friend's lack of remorse.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. From an ethical standpoint, sharing someone's private message without their consent can be seen as privacy violation. However, the context here is that the message was harmful and targeted someone vulnerable. The author's intent is to address the friend's behavior and maybe get the parents to intervene since the friend isn't taking responsibility.\n\nBut there's a tension between privacy and accountability. While the author's motivation is to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's cruelty, using a private message as evidence to a parent could be considered a breach of privacy. However, given the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse, some might argue that it's a justified action to prevent further harm.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they usually hide things from parents, implying that this group dynamic might involve some level of secrecy. The author might feel that this is the only way to make the friend understand the seriousness without the other friends getting involved.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's action is a form of retaliation, but it's in response to a harmful comment. The friend's behavior was clearly in the wrong, so the author's action could be seen as a way to hold them accountable. However, using private messages in this way could have consequences, like damaging relationships or escalating conflicts in unintended ways.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because their action was a response to a hurtful and disrespectful comment towards someone in a vulnerable state. The friend's behavior was the root issue, and the author's action was an attempt to address it when other methods failed. However, some might still argue that sharing the message without consent is wrong, regardless of the intent. But given the context, the author's intent was to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's toxic behavior, which could be seen as justifiable.\n"
