All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author then sends a screenshot of that friend insulting his girlfriend to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend made a joke that was clearly offensive, targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition. The author felt that the friend crossed a line and decided to escalate the situation by involving the friend's mom. The user believes the author is in the wrong, but wants to see if that's accurate.\n\nSo, the main issue is about appropriate responses to hurtful comments. The friend's comment was mean and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author's response was to send a screenshot to the friend's mom, which the user considers a \"shitty thing to do.\" The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was inexcusable. Making fun of someone's health issues is not okay, and there's no excuse for that. The author has every right to be upset. However, the author's response was to involve the friend's mom, which could be seen as a form of retaliation or taking things private. The question is whether this action was justified.\n\nThe author mentions that they are in a group chat with other friends who don't know what to do. The author also notes that the friend has no remorse. So, the author might feel that confronting the friend in front of others or through other means isn't effective, hence the decision to escalate to the parent.\n\nBut is sending the screenshot to the mom the right approach? It could be seen as crossing a line. The friend's mom might not be aware of the context, so the screenshot could be taken out of context. This might lead to unnecessary conflict or misunderstanding. The author's action could be considered a form of bullying or passive-aggressive behavior, using parental involvement as a weapon to retaliate.\n\nHowever, considering the severity of the friend's comment, the author might feel that they have no other recourse. If the friend is unrepentant and the group isn't supporting the author, the author might feel isolated. But the appropriate response would be to address the issue directly with the friend first, perhaps involving mutual friends or a mediator, rather than going over the friend's head to his parent without explanation.\n\nThe author's justification is that they don't want to escalate in front of other friends who haven't taken sides. But escalating to the parent is still an escalation. The key here is whether the action was proportionate. The friend made a hurtful joke, and the author's response is to involve the parent. Depending on the context, this might be seen as disproportionate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend's comment was about the girlfriend's health, which is a sensitive and serious matter. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a direct attack on someone in a vulnerable state. So, the author's anger and desire to take action is understandable. However, using the parent as a means to retaliate could be seen as wrong because it's a private matter and might not address the root issue.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the user is in a difficult spot. The friend's behavior is clearly wrong, but the author's response might not be the best solution. The right approach would be to confront the friend directly, set boundaries, and perhaps seek support from friends or other trusted adults. Sending the screenshot to the mom could backfire, especially if the context isn't clear. The author might not realize that their action could cause more harm than good, even if the friend deserved it.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action is a form of retaliation that might not be justified, even if the friend was in the wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how they chose to respond.\n"
