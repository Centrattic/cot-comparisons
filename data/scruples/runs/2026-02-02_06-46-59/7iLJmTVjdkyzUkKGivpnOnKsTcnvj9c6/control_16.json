All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend made a really offensive comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend was being rude and making a joke about her weight, which is a sensitive topic because her medical condition is causing her to be swollen and bloated. The author then sent a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate. He targeted the author's girlfriend's health issues, which is a serious matter. The author felt that this was crossing a line, and since the friend had no remorse, the author might have felt that escalating the situation by involving his mom was a way to address the problem without causing a bigger conflict in front of others. \n\nNow, looking at the actions: sending a screenshot to the friend's mom. On one hand, this is sharing private messages without consent, which is generally considered a violation of privacy. However, the context here is that the original message was harmful and targeted a vulnerable person. The author might have believed that the friend's parents needed to know about his behavior, especially if the friend is underage (since the author is 18 and the friend's parents are involved, maybe the friend is a minor). \n\nBut if the friend is also 18, then it's a different scenario. However, the question mentions the friend's \"real dad,\" which might suggest he's a minor. Also, the group chat was among friends, possibly including minors. The author might be trying to protect his girlfriend and hold his friend accountable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's initial comment was definitely wrong. The author's response was to send the screenshot to the mom. The question is whether the author overstepped by sharing private messages. Normally, sharing someone's private messages without their consent is a breach of privacy, but there's an argument that the author was trying to prevent further harm to his girlfriend by involving the friend's parents. \n\nHowever, there might be other ways to address the issue, like confronting the friend directly, involving mutual friends, or escalating to a school authority if that's applicable. Sharing it with the mom might be seen as a form of revenge or a way to get back at the friend for the comment, which could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend's behavior is ongoing and he shows no remorse, the author might feel that this action was necessary to stop him from making the same kind of comments. The girlfriend's health issues make the situation especially sensitive. \n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's comment was offensive and targeted a vulnerable person; the author's action was to involve the friend's mother. The author's intent was likely to protect his girlfriend and address the friend's behavior. However, the method involved violating the friend's privacy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be justified in wanting to protect his girlfriend, but the method might not be the best approach. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the answer is B (No), it's because the context justifies it. If A (Yes), because sharing private messages is wrong regardless of the context. \n\nI think the answer is B, because the author was trying to address a harmful situation and the friend's comment was particularly cruel. The author's action, while violating privacy, was in response to a serious insult against a vulnerable person. However, there's a line here. But given the options, the answer is likely B.\n"
