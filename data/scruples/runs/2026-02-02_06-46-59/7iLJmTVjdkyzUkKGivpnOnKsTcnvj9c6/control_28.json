All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend's comment was about her weight, which is a sensitive topic because of her medical condition. The author tried to confront him, but the friend didn't show remorse. The author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom to maybe get the friend in trouble.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive, targeting someone with a medical condition. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so making fun of her weight is not just rude but could be considered bullying or harassment. \n\nThe author tried to address it directly but the friend didn't take it seriously. The author is frustrated and wants to escalate the situation by involving the friend's mom. But is that justified? On one hand, the friend's behavior is unacceptable and needs to be addressed. On the other hand, sending a screenshot to a parent without the friend's consent could be seen as a breach of privacy or an overreaction. \n\nBut considering the context, the friend's actions were malicious and the author's girlfriend is in a difficult situation. The author might be trying to protect their partner and hold the friend accountable. However, involving the friend's parent might not be the best approach unless it's to address the friend's behavior. However, the author's motivation is to stop the friend from making fun of their partner, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend made a hurtful comment, the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to stop their friend from continuing this behavior. The method (screenshot to mom) could be questionable, but given the context of the friend's insensitivity and lack of remorse, the author's actions could be seen as an attempt to correct a wrong. However, maybe there's a better way, but the question isn't about the best approach, just whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the author sent the screenshot without considering the friend's intentions, maybe the author overstepped. But in this case, the friend's comment was clearly targeted and cruel. The author's girlfriend's health is a serious issue, so the comment was not just a joke. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action might be justified as a response to a hurtful comment. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Could there be a misunderstanding? The friend might have thought it was a joke, but the author's perspective shows that it was intentional. The author's right to defend their partner's dignity is important. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
