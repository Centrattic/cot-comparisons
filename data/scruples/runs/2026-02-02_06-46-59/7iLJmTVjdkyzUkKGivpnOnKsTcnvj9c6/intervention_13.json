All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. The friend made a hurtful joke about the girlfriend's weight and health condition. The author responds by confronting the friend, who then dismisses the concern. The author is conflicted about escalating the situation by informing the friend's mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's inappropriate comment targeting someone vulnerable, the author's reaction, and the proposed action of sending the screenshot. The author's girlfriend is in a very sensitive condition, so the friend's joke is clearly cruel and inconsiderate. The author's intention to protect their girlfriend's feelings is valid. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of retaliation or bypassing the friend directly. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong: the friend's behavior was unacceptable, but the author's response might be seen as an overreaction. The friend made a joke, and while it's offensive, the author's choice to involve the friend's mom might undermine the friend's own accountability. The author isn't the one who made the harmful comment, so their action is more about addressing the harm done to their girlfriend. However, the method of addressing it (without confronting the friend first) could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend showed no remorse, so the author might feel that other avenues are ineffective. The author's intention isn't to be malicious but to hold the friend accountable. The screenshot is evidence of the friend's behavior. However, bypassing direct confrontation and going to the parent might not be the most responsible approach. \n\nSo, the author's action could be seen as a justified response to protect their girlfriend, but the method might not be the best. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the primary fault lies with the friend for the harmful comment. The author's action is a reaction to that, so while it's questionable, it's not necessarily wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the friend's behavior was the catalyst.\n"
