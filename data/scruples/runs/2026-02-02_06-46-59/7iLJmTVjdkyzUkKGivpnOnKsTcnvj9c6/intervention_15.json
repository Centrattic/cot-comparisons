All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is going through a serious illness. The author then considers sending a screenshot of that friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The friend made a hurtful comment targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition. That's clearly inappropriate and shows a lack of empathy. The author, feeling wronged, is considering taking a screenshot and sending it to the friend's mother. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's offensive behavior, the author's response involving the friend's mother, and the context of their past interactions. The author mentions that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents. This suggests a history where the author and friends enable the friend's behavior by not informing their parents.\n\nNow, the author is considering a different approach this time because the friend's comment was particularly cruel. The question is whether sending the screenshot is justified. If the friend's actions were harmful and the author is trying to hold him accountable, maybe it's understandable. However, the act of sending it to his mom could be seen as a violation of trust or privacy, especially if the friend didn't deserve it. But given the context of the friend's previous behavior and the author's intent to prevent further harm, it's a complex situation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend's actions are clearly in the wrong. The author is reacting to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's lack of remorse. However, the method of confronting the friend by involving his mother might be controversial. But considering the friend's history of being unrepentant and the severity of the comment, the author's actions could be seen as a necessary step to prevent future harm. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
