All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a joke about their girlfriend undergoing chemo to his mom. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is in a group chat discussing lacrosse when a friend makes a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who has lupus and is going through chemo, leading to her being swollen from kidney issues. The friend's comment is cruel and targets her weight and health. The author responds, tries to call out the friend's behavior, but the friend doesn't take it seriously. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the offensive messages to his mom to confront the friend, as they usually share things with parents, but the friend has a history of hiding things from his mom.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to send the screenshot. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break down the key points. The friend made a hurtful, insensitive comment targeting the author's girlfriend's health condition. The author tried to address it directly but was met with no remorse. The author is considering escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's initial comments are clearly in the wrong. He made a joke at the expense of someone who is seriously ill, which is not only cruel but also shows a lack of empathy. The author's reaction to standing up for their girlfriend is understandable. However, the question is about the author's action of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is trying to hold the friend accountable for his actions. But does the author have the right to do so? The friend's comment was a private message in a group chat, so sharing it without consent could be seen as violating privacy. However, the context is that the comment was malicious and targeted someone's health issues. \n\nThere's a balance between protecting privacy and addressing harmful behavior. If the author's intention is to prevent the friend from continuing to make such jokes and to make him understand the inappropriateness of his comment, then sharing it with the mom might serve as a lesson. On the other hand, the author is using a method that could be seen as a form of revenge or escalating conflict, especially since the friends typically hide things from parents. \n\nLegally, sharing someone's private messages without their consent might be considered a violation of privacy. However, the ethical aspect is more nuanced. The harm caused by the friend's comment is significant, and the author is trying to correct the behavior. \n\nBut then again, the author's action could be seen as crossing a line by involving the friend's mother without first exhausting other possible solutions, like confronting the friend more directly or seeking mediation from other friends. Also, the author's motivation might include personal vendettas, like the mention of the friend's real dad, which could cloud their judgment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's initial comment is clearly wrong, but the author's method of responding could be questionable. If the author's action is considered a justified response to an unjust comment, then maybe not in the wrong. However, if sending the screenshot is seen as an overstep beyond what's necessary, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is the balance between righting a wrong and respecting privacy. The author's intention is to address a serious issue, but the method might not be the best approach. So while the author's motives are understandable, the action could still be seen as wrong. Alternatively, if the action is considered a necessary step to teach the friend a lesson, then not wrong.\n"
