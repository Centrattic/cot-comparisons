All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to send a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through a serious illness with chemo and kidney issues. The friend's comment was not only insensitive but targeted the girlfriend's physical state due to her medical condition. The author confronts the friend, but the friend shows no remorse.\n\nNow, the author is considering sending a screenshot of the message to the friend's mom. They're conflicted because they don't want to escalate things in front of other friends, and they know the friend hides things from his parents. The friends are unsure how to act.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider the ethical aspects. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and inappropriate, given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author tried to address it directly but was dismissed. In such cases, confronting the issue is important to protect the girlfriend's feelings and hold the friend accountable.\n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom might be seen as a form of retaliation rather than a constructive solution. It could damage relationships and might not address the root of the problem. But considering the lack of remorse from the friend and the severity of the comment, the author might feel that this is a necessary step to prevent future harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried other avenues first, like involving a mutual adult or seeking mediation. But given the context\u2014friends aren't taking sides and the friend is unrepentant\u2014it's understandable why the author feels this is the only option left.\n\nThe key points are the friend's insensitivity, the author's attempt to address it, and the lack of resolution. While reporting the issue to the friend's mom might be outside the usual social boundaries, the intent is to protect their friend's girlfriend and prevent future harm. So, in this case, the author's action is a reaction to a serious transgression, which might make them not entirely in the wrong.\n"
