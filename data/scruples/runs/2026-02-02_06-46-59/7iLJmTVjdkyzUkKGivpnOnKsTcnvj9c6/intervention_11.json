All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. \n\nFirst, the context: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and suffering from health complications. The author, feeling that the friend showed no remorse, decides to send a screenshot of the comment to his mom. The author is 18, and they were in a group chat. The friends usually help the friend hide things from his parents. The author is conflicted because they don't want to escalate things in front of friends but are also angry and considering exposing the friend's comment to his mom.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n1. The friend's comment was about the author's girlfriend's health issues, which is extremely sensitive and cruel.\n2. The author felt the friend had no remorse and wanted to hold him accountable.\n3. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation or to inform her about her son's behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's initial comment was definitely inappropriate and harmful. The author's girlfriend is dealing with serious health issues, and making fun of her condition is inconsiderate and hurtful. The friend's lack of remorse is also a red flag.\n\nHowever, the author's response of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of confrontation. The ethical dilemma here is whether this action is justified. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a harmful joke and possibly get the friend in trouble, which could prevent future incidents. On the other hand, confronting the issue in front of friends might lead to embarrassment for the friend, and doing it behind his back could be seen as underhanded. \n\nBut given the context\u2014that the friend's comment was about the girlfriend's health, which is a very sensitive topic, and the friend showed no remorse\u2014the author might feel that their action is necessary to hold the friend accountable. However, the method of confronting the parent without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the friend typically keeps things hidden. \n\nBut considering the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of empathy, some might argue the author had a right to act. Others might say that the author should have addressed it directly with the friend, perhaps with the help of friends, rather than escalating to the parent. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the situation isn't so black and white. The friend's actions were clearly wrong, and the author is in a stressful situation. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect their girlfriend and hold someone accountable for a hurtful comment. However, sending the screenshot to the mom without a direct conversation might not be the best approach, but the intent could be seen as justified. \n\nAlternatively, if the author's action breaches trust or could lead to further conflict, they might be in the wrong. But given the context of the friend's cruelty, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the initial comment was worse, and the author is trying to address a serious issue. However, the method could be debated. But the key is whether the action itself is wrong. In this case, exposing the friend's harmful comment to his parent might be a justified measure given the circumstances, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
