All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive message to his mom. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's comment was not only rude but targeted someone with a serious medical condition. The author tried to address it, but the friend dismissed it. The author then considered sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, which is a private action. \n\nNow, considering the moral and ethical aspects. The friend's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. The author's response, while possibly invading privacy, could be seen as a protective measure for their girlfriend. However, sending private messages to a parent without consent might be crossing a line. \n\nBut wait, the group chat was public among friends, so the messages were shared in a space where others could see. The author is trying to escalate the issue to the parent to correct the friend's behavior, which might be justified given the severity of the comment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have had a more direct confrontation or involved mutual friends. Using the parent might be seen as an underhanded approach. However, the friend showed no remorse, so the author's options are limited. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The friend's comment was clearly wrong, and the author is trying to hold them accountable. The method might be questionable, but the intent is to protect a loved one. So, the answer would depend on whether the action is proportionate. Since the comment was extremely harsh, the author's action might be justified as a form of intervention.\n"
