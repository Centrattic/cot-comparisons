All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author confronted the friend, who showed no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot to the friend's mom to escalate things.\n\nI need to consider the context. The friend's comment was not just a joke but targeted someone with a serious illness. That's pretty harsh. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so the joke could be seen as insensitive and cruel. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" suggests he's dismissive of the impact of his words.\n\nNow, the author's plan is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether this action is justified. On one hand, the friend crossed a line with a hurtful comment. On the other, the author is using a screenshot as a form of retaliation. \n\nIs the author's action a reasonable response? Retaliation can sometimes be a problem, but in this case, it's about protecting a loved one and holding someone accountable for a cruel joke. However, involving parents might be seen as using a higher authority to settle a conflict, which could be considered underhanded. But given the severity of the comment, maybe the author's action is a justified way to address the issue without escalating it further in person.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the group chat friends aren't taking a side, so they might feel isolated. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be their way of getting the friend to face consequences, especially since he's not showing remorse. \n\nBut is this the right approach? It might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy if the author didn't have the friend's consent to share his messages. However, the friend's comment was public in the group chat, so there's a different set of expectations about privacy here. \n\nAlso, considering the context of their relationship, they call the person a \"friend,\" but the friend's behavior is toxic. The author might be trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it okay to use a screenshot to show the friend's mom? It's a private message that was meant for the group, but sharing it with a parent could be seen as a necessary step to address the harm done. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like confronting the friend more directly or involving other friends to mediate. But the author felt that the friend was not remorseful and didn't want to escalate things in front of others. \n\nSo, weighing the friend's malicious comment against the author's response, it's a tough call. However, given the severity of the joke and the lack of remorse from the friend, the author's action might be seen as a justified attempt to address the issue, even if it's a bit underhanded. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
