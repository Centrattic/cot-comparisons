All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a joke about the author's girlfriend, who is battling a serious illness with chemo and lupus. The friend's comment is about the girlfriend's appearance due to her medical condition, which is hurtful and insensitive.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly inappropriate. Making a joke about someone's medical condition, especially when it's a result of their health struggles, is cruel. The friend showed no remorse, which adds to the problem. The author is considering sending a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for considering this action? Well, the friend's comment was a direct attack on the author's girlfriend's health and appearance. The author is upset and wants to address this, but the friend isn't taking it seriously. The author is trying to avoid escalating the situation in front of others and is using a method they know the friend's mom might see. \n\nHowever, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of retaliation that could be seen as crossing a line. It's not directly confronting the friend but using his parent's involvement instead. The question is whether this action is justified. The author might feel it's necessary because the friend is unrepentant and there's a history of covering for each other. But generally, reporting someone's behavior to a parent is considered a betrayal, even if the original action was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was extremely insensitive. On the other, the author's method of addressing it might not be the best approach. The moral dilemma here is about the right way to handle a friend's harmful behavior. While the author has valid reasons for being upset, using a screenshot as a way to involve the parent could be seen as wrong because it's a personal and public exposure. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action might not be the right approach, but the friend's behavior is definitely in the wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is seeking justice for their girlfriend's treatment, but using a method that's ethically questionable, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the act of reporting to the parent without direct confrontation might be seen as wrong because it could damage trust and relationships. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the friend was cruel, sending the screenshot to the mom might be an overstep. The author should consider other ways to address it, like a direct conversation or telling the friend's mom themselves if necessary, but using a screenshot without context could be harsh.\n"
