All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment to his mom. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and suffering from serious health issues. The friend made a cruel joke about her weight and health.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend made a hurtful comment targeting the author's girlfriend, who is already in a vulnerable state. The author confronted the friend, but he showed no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of accountability, possibly to avoid escalating things in front of other friends. The friends are caught in the middle and haven't taken sides yet.\n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. The key factors here are the context of the joke, the intent of the author, and the consequence of sending the screenshot. \n\nThe friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and cruel, especially given the health issues of the girlfriend. The author's motivation is to address the friend's lack of remorse and potentially protect his girlfriend from further harm. However, the method of addressing it by involving the friend's mother might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nBut the alternative is to let the friend off the hook without any consequence, which could enable further hurtful behavior. The author is trying to use parental involvement as a way to make the friend understand the seriousness of his words. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The screenshot itself is evidence of the friend's inappropriate behavior. However, sharing it with the parent might be seen as a breach of privacy or an overstep, especially if the author didn't confront the friend directly first. But given the context\u2014a vulnerable person being targeted\u2014the author might be justified in seeking help from the parent to ensure accountability.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author's intent is to address a cruel and harmful comment made by the friend, especially when the friend showed no remorse. The author is trying to prevent further harm to his girlfriend and isn't escalating the situation recklessly but rather seeking a way to make the friend understand the severity of his actions. However, it's a tough call because the method of involving the parent could be problematic. But given the circumstances, B might be the better choice.\n"
