All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to send a screenshot of their friend making a hurtful comment about his girlfriend undergoing chemo is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a joke about the girlfriend's appearance, which is related to her medical condition. The author is considering sending this screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is if this action makes the author wrong.\n\nThe friend's comment is clearly inappropriate and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author is reacting to a direct insult towards someone who's vulnerable. However, the method chosen is to involve the friend's mom, which could be seen as escalating the conflict behind the friend's back. \n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. The friend's behavior was cruel, so the author has a valid grievance. But retaliating by leaking the message to the friend's parent without a direct confrontation might not be the right approach. It's about whether the ends justify the means. \n\nAlso, the group chat context matters. Other friends are present but haven't taken sides. The author might want to address it without public escalation. However, sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a breach of privacy and possibly manipulating the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend showed no remorse, maybe the author felt it was necessary to involve someone who could hold him accountable. The key here is the intent: the author wants to correct the friend's behavior, but the method could be harmful. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The initial comment was definitely the friend's fault. The author's response was to report it, which can be seen as a way to address the issue. However, sending it to the mom instead of confronting the friend directly might be considered wrong because it's an indirect and possibly vindictive action. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action is justified. If the author's intent is to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable, but the method is underhanded, then maybe the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, if the friend's actions were so egregious that the author felt it necessary to involve his parent to prevent further harm, then maybe not. \n\nBut generally, confronting the friend directly or involving a parent without prior communication could be seen as wrong. The author's action might be morally questionable because it's a behind-the-back move, even if the friend was at fault. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). Wait, but maybe the user is in the right because the friend was out of line. It's a bit of a toss-up. The key is whether the author's action was proportionate and the right approach. Since the author is considering it as a way to avoid escalation in front of others, but it's still a form of escalation, maybe the answer is A. But I need to check again.\n\nThe friend's comment was a direct attack on the girlfriend's health-related condition. The author is trying to address it. However, sending the screenshot to the mom might not be the best approach. It's a form of revenge rather than a constructive resolution. So, the author's action is not in the wrong because the friend was wrong, but the method is questionable. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the friend was wrong, then the author's action is a response. But the author's action is the issue. So, even if the friend was wrong, the author's choice to send the screenshot to the mom could be considered wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
