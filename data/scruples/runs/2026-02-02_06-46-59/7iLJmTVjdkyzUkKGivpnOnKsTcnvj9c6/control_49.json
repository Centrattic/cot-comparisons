All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. The friend made a comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author tried to joke back but the friend crossed the line. The author is considering taking this screenshot to the friend's mom to handle the situation without escalating in front of others.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the friend's comment was inappropriate. The friend called the author's girlfriend a \"400-pound fatass\" and that in the context of her being swollen from chemo and lupus. That's definitely cruel and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The friend shows no remorse, which is a problem.\n\nNow, the author's response was to consider sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The key points here are the context of the friend's comment and the author's intention. The author wanted to address the issue without escalating in front of friends, and they're using a method that others have used before (helping the friend hide things from parents). \n\nBut is it right to go to the friend's mom? It's a private message, and the author is using a tactic that might embarrass the friend. However, given the context that the friend has a history of making offensive remarks without remorse, and the girlfriend's serious health issues, the author is trying to hold the friend accountable. \n\nThe author isn't directly confronting the friend in front of others, which might prevent further conflict. However, sending it to his mom could be seen as using a behind-the-scenes approach. Whether this is justified depends on the severity of the offense. Since the friend's comment was about a vulnerable person's health condition, it's a serious matter. The author's action might be seen as a proportionate response to address the friend's behavior, especially if the friend isn't taking it seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should handle it directly with the friend or involve a teacher or authority figure instead of going to the parent. But given the user's context, they might not want to escalate further or involve others, so sending the screenshot to the mom could be their way of holding the friend accountable without public confrontation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action might be seen as a justified response to a hurtful and insensitive comment, aiming to address the issue discreetly. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
