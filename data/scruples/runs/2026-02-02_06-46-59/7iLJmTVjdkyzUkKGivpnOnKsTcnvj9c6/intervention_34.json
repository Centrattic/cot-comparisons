All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of his friend making a joke about his girlfriend's chemotherapy to his friend's mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend said something really offensive about the author's girlfriend, who is going through a serious illness. The author tried to respond in a joking way, but the friend escalated it with a comment that's inappropriate given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author then considered sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue without confronting him directly in front of others.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. So I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive. The author had a right to be upset. But by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, the author is taking a private conversation and sharing it with someone else, which could be seen as violating privacy or escalating the conflict in a personal way.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the friend's comment being about a health issue, which is a sensitive topic, the author might feel that the friend's actions were unacceptable. The friend showed no remorse, so the author might be trying to get a higher authority (the mom) to intervene. But the question is whether the author's action is wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's private messages without consent is generally considered wrong. Even if the message was offensive, the appropriate response might be to address it directly with the person involved, possibly with mediation from mutual friends or other support. Sending it to the mom could be seen as a form of retaliation or bypassing the friend, which might not resolve the issue constructively and could damage relationships further.\n\nSo, while the friend's comment was definitely inappropriate, the author's method of responding by involving the parent might not be the best approach. The author could be in the wrong because they didn't handle it through direct communication or involve a more neutral third party, instead opting for a personal attack on the friend's privacy. However, given the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of remorse, some might argue it's a justified action. But generally, the ethical stance is that sharing private messages without consent is wrong regardless of the situation. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
