All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author considered sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the friend's actions. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend's weight, referencing her health issues (like being swollen from chemo and lupus). That's clearly inappropriate and cruel. The friend showed no remorse, which adds to the problem.\n\nNow, the author's response was to consider sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for this. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key points here are: the friend's comment was harmful and insensitive, the author felt wronged, and the author's action was a form of confrontation. But is the author in the wrong for taking that step? \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was the initial problem. The author tried to address it directly but didn't get a positive response. The author's action, while private, could be seen as a way to involve the friend's parents to address the behavior. However, sending a screenshot without context might misrepresent the situation. The friend might have been joking, though given the context, it was cruel. \n\nThe author's motivation is to hold the friend accountable. However, using a group chat and then escalating to the parent could be seen as a breach of privacy and potentially escalating the conflict. Friends hiding things from parents usually isn't the healthiest dynamic, but in this case, the author's action is to expose the friend's harmful comment. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is reacting to a hurtful joke about their girlfriend's health. The action taken is a form of confrontation, which could be justified as protecting their partner. However, the method (screenshot to the mom) is questionable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the initial harm was from the friend. The author's action is a response. While it's not the most mature approach (since it's tattling), the root issue is the friend's inappropriate comment. The author's action might be inconsiderate of the friend's privacy, but given the context, the friend's behavior was worse. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they were responding to a harmful comment. The friend's actions were the real issue here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
