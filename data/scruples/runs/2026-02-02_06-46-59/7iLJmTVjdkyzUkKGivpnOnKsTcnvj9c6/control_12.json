All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that their friend made a really hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend said something about her being 400 pounds and fat, which is insensitive given her medical condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the friend's actions. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially in a group chat where others can see, is definitely crossing a line. The friend showed no remorse and even doubled down by saying \"Don't talk shit then.\" That's pretty dismissive.\n\nNow, the author's response is to consider sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. On one hand, the friend's comment was cruel and the author is trying to hold them accountable. On the other hand, involving the friend's mom might escalate the situation and could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if they're friends and there's an unspoken rule of keeping things private. Also, the author mentions that they and others often help the friend hide things from his parents. \n\nBut the key point here is the friend's comment targeted someone who's already vulnerable due to her health. The author's girlfriend is in a very sensitive state, and the friend's joke is not only mean but also shows a lack of empathy. The author might feel that sending the screenshot to the mom is a way to make the friend realize the severity of his actions. However, is this the right approach? \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend is definitely in the wrong for the comment. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. But the method of holding them accountable by leaking the message to the parents could be problematic. It might be seen as a violation of privacy, even if the original message was hurtful. The author's friends are also not taking a side, which adds to the pressure. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's intent is to stop the friend from continuing the harassment, but the method might be ethically questionable. However, given the severity of the friend's comment, some might argue that the author is justified in taking this action to protect their girlfriend and expose the friend's behavior. It's a tricky situation where both sides have their points, but the main issue is the friend's initial cruelty. The author's action could be seen as a form of retaliation, which isn't ideal, but the context of the friend's actions might mitigate that. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong because the friend's actions were so harmful. However, it's a gray area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the context of the friend's severe comment, the author's action is a reaction to protect their girlfriend, which might justify their actions despite the potential violation of privacy. So the answer is B.\n"
