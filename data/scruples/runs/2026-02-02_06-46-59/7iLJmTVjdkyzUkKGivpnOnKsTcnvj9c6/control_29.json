All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author responded initially in a playful way, but when the friend escalated with a hurtful comment, the author confronted him. The friend dismissed the concern, showing no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as retaliation.\n\nSo, the key points here: the friend's comment was both sexist and made light of someone's serious medical condition. The author's girlfriend is dealing with significant health challenges, and the friend's joke is not just a joke but a harmful statement. The author is frustrated and wants to take action but is unsure if it's right.\n\nNow, considering the morality here. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic and insensitive. Making fun of someone's health issues, especially when it's as severe as chemo and lupus complications, crosses a line. The friend's lack of remorse adds to the issue. \n\nOn the author's part, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of confronting the issue. However, there's a nuance here. The author is using a method that's behind the friend's back, which might be seen as underhanded. But considering the context, the friend's comment was public in a group chat, so the author is not fabricating or distorting the message. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the action is a response to a harmful joke. The author might be justified in wanting to address it, especially since the friend isn't taking responsibility. However, escalating the situation by involving the parent could have unintended consequences. But given the severity of the comment, some might argue it's necessary to hold the friend accountable. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend's comment is genuinely offensive and the author is trying to address it by showing it to the parent, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The alternative is that they should have handled it differently, like confronting the friend directly or seeking mediation, but the author already tried that and the friend didn't take it seriously. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were inexcusable, and the author is trying to address a serious issue. However, there's a debate about the method of response. But in terms of moral responsibility, the friend's behavior is more clearly wrong, so the author's action could be seen as a justified attempt to correct the wrongdoing.\n"
