All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the original question) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's seriously ill. The author confronted the friend, who dismissed it. Now, the author is considering escalating by sharing the screenshot with the friend's mom.\n\nThe main issue here is whether taking this action is justified. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate, especially considering the girlfriend's health. The author tried to address it directly, but the friend showed no remorse. \n\nNow, the question is if the author is wrong for taking this step. On one hand, sharing the screenshot could be seen as a form of retaliation, which might not be the best solution. It could damage relationships and maybe even be considered bullying if taken to an extreme. However, the friend's comment was inconsiderate and hurtful, and the author felt that confronting them wasn't effective. \n\nThe key points are the context of the joke and the severity of the situation. The girlfriend is going through a tough time, so the joke was especially insensitive. The author might feel justified in protecting their partner and holding the friend accountable. \n\nBut is sending the screenshot to the mom a reasonable action? It could be seen as overreacting, but given the friend's lack of remorse and the serious nature of the comment, it might be viewed as necessary. However, using another person's parent in this way could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, sometimes people take personal actions when they feel wronged, but the appropriateness can be subjective. The author's intent is to stop the friend from making such jokes in the future. If the friend doesn't take it seriously, maybe involving the parent is a last resort. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the action is meant to correct the behavior and prevent further harm, some might see it as justified. Others might argue that it's not the author's place to involve the friend's family. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the friend's comment was harmful and the author tried to address it but faced resistance. However, this is a nuanced situation where both sides have arguments. The main factor is the context of the joke and the friend's lack of empathy. The author's action could be seen as a response to protect their partner and address the friend's inappropriate behavior, which might make the author not in the wrong.\n"
