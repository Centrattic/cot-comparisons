All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's dealing with serious health issues from chemo and lupus. The friend's comment was clearly insensitive and targeted the girlfriend's health-related appearance. The author tried to respond in a way they thought was teasing back, but the friend didn't take it seriously and escalated the insult. \n\nThe author then considered sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether this action is wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comments were hurtful and crossed a line. The author might feel justified in wanting to address it, especially since the friend showed no remorse. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a breach of privacy. It's not clear if the author gave the friend a chance to apologize or if the group chat friends were aware of the friend's history of making jokes about sensitive topics. \n\nThe author mentions that the group chat friends haven't taken a side yet, and they've helped the friend hide things from their parents. If the author sends the screenshot, it might escalate the situation and could lead to more conflict. On the other hand, if the friend's behavior is truly toxic and harmful, the author might feel that they need to take action to protect their girlfriend's feelings and their own dignity.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, even if the friend was in the wrong, does the author have the right to involve the friend's mom without a conversation first? There's a possibility that the mom might overreact or that the situation could become more complicated. The author might have other options first, like confronting the friend directly with the group or discussing it with their girlfriend about how she feels. \n\nHowever, given the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse from the friend, the author's action could be seen as a justified attempt to hold the friend accountable. If the friend is aware that his jokes are hurtful and continues anyway, the author might feel that more drastic measures are necessary. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether sending the screenshot is the right approach. It's a private message that the author is sharing with the friend's parent without the friend's consent. This could be seen as a violation of privacy and trust. Even if the friend's words were offensive, the method of addressing it might be seen as inappropriate. The author is using a tactic that the friend himself used (spreading information to others) against him, which could be hypocritical if the author hasn't tried to resolve it directly first.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't give the friend an opportunity to apologize and instead took a confrontational step that could backfire, even if the friend was in the wrong. However, if the friend's behavior is a pattern, maybe the author's action is justified. But the main point is the action of sending the screenshot without prior discussion, which could be seen as wrong regardless of the friend's initial offense.\n"
