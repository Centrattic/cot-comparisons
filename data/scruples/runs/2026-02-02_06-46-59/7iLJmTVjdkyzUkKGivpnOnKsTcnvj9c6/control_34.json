All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who has a serious medical condition. The author felt that the friend was mocking something very sensitive. The friend showed no remorse, which escalated the situation. The author is considering taking a screenshot of the offensive message and sending it to the friend's mom to address the issue without confronting the friend directly in front of others.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the joke, the severity of the medical condition being mocked, and the author's intention. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a harmful remark targeting someone's health. The author's girlfriend is under significant medical stress, so the joke was particularly cruel. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable, albeit through a method that might be seen as underhanded (involving the mom). But considering the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author's action might be a way to protect their girlfriend and prevent further harm. However, sending the screenshot without the friend's knowledge is a privacy invasion. But in the context of defending someone's dignity against a serious insult, it's a grey area. The answer would depend on whether the action was justified given the severity of the offense. Since the joke targeted a health issue and the friend didn't take it seriously, the author's action might be seen as a necessary step to address the problem, even if not the most direct method. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
