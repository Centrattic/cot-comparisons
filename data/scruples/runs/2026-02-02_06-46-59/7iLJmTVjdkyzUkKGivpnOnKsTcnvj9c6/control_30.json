All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend made a cruel joke about his girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom. The options are A for yes, the author is wrong, and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend said something really hurtful about the author's girlfriend, who's dealing with a serious illness. The author is upset and wants to confront the friend but is considering sending the message to his mom instead of addressing it directly. \n\nThe friend's comment was about the girlfriend's weight and health issues, which is insensitive. The author tried to respond but didn't get through to the friend. Now he's thinking of involving the friend's mom. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions were definitely inconsiderate and harmful. But sending the screenshot to the friend's mom without any prior attempt to resolve the issue directly might be seen as escalating the conflict in a way that's not mature. \n\nThe author should probably address the friend first, maybe have a serious talk, or seek mediation. If the friend's mom is involved, that could lead to a bigger confrontation. But given that the friend has no remorse, maybe the author is trying to protect his girlfriend by getting the friend in trouble. \n\nHowever, the act of sending the screenshot without telling the friend first might be seen as underhanded. But considering the friend's behavior, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are the severity of the friend's comments and the author's intent to protect his girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the friend is clearly at fault for making the joke. The author's actions are a response to that. While sneaking around to tell the mom isn't ideal, the motivation is to protect someone who's vulnerable. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a nuance here because the method might not be the best, but the intent is justified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have tried to talk to the friend first. But since he's 18, maybe he's not mature enough to handle it. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the friend made a hurtful comment, the author is justified in taking action. So I think the answer is B.\n"
