All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sent a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through a serious medical condition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a joke targeting the author's girlfriend, who is suffering from lupus and undergoing chemo, leading to her being swollen and bloated. The friend's comment was about her weight, which is a sensitive issue given her health. The author tried to confront the friend, but he dismissed it, saying \"Don't talk shit then,\" showing no remorse.\n\nNow, the author's response was to send a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom. The user is questioning if that's justified. The key points here are the intent behind the action and the proportionality of the response. \n\nThe author's motivations include not wanting to escalate things in front of other friends and feeling that the friend is beyond reason. They also mention that the group often hides things from the friend's parents. So, using that method might be their way of addressing the issue without direct confrontation. \n\nHowever, sending the screenshot without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a breach of privacy and trust. Even though the friend made a hurtful comment, retaliating by exposing it might be considered an overstep. The author's action bypasses the friend's accountability and might not lead to a constructive resolution. It's possible that confronting the friend directly or involving a mutual friend or an authority figure could be more appropriate steps.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's comment was clearly inconsiderate and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author might feel that the friend is being disrespectful and needs to face consequences. But using a behind-the-scenes approach by informing the parent could be seen as underhanded rather than addressing the issue openly.\n\nConsidering both sides, while the friend's comment was wrong, the author's response might not be the most ethical or effective approach. The answer likely depends on the perspective: if the action is about seeking justice versus the method used to do so. Since the author is using a covert method that could damage relationships without a fair process, it's possible they are in the wrong. However, the context of the friend's insensitive behavior complicates things. But based on the scenario, the action of sending the screenshot without trying to resolve it directly might be considered in the wrong.\n"
