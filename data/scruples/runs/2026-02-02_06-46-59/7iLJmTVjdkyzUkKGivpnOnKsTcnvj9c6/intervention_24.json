All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend made a joke about his girlfriend who's going through chemo, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to his friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend said something offensive during a group chat. The author responded by making a joke about the friend's weight, which might not have been appropriate either. Then the friend made a comment about the author's girlfriend, who is dealing with a serious illness, leading to her being swollen and bloated. The author confronts the friend, who shows no remorse. Now, the author is thinking of escalating the situation by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, possibly to get the parents involved.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action. Let's break it down. The initial insult by the friend was about the girlfriend's health, which is a sensitive topic. The author's response was to mock the friend's appearance, which might not be the best approach but could be seen as a natural reaction in a heated moment. However, the key issue here is the author's plan to involve the friend's mom. \n\nSending a screenshot to a parent without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if they're friends. The author mentions that they and their friends often help the kid hide things from his parents, implying that there's a history of secrecy. If the author breaks that trust now, it could damage their friendship and the trust they've built with the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's comments were cruel and targeted a vulnerable situation. The author's girlfriend is in a very tough position, and the friend's joke shows a lack of empathy. The author might feel justified in taking action to protect their girlfriend's feelings and hold the friend accountable. However, the method of doing so\u2014sending it to the mom without a direct confrontation\u2014might be seen as passive-aggressive or cutting corners. \n\nAnother angle is whether there's a better way to handle this. The author could have talked to the friend more seriously, maybe even confronted him in private, or sought support from mutual friends. Using the parents could be a way to make the friend take the comment seriously, but it might also lead to unintended consequences, like the friend feeling betrayed or the parents overreacting. \n\nAlso, considering the author's age (18), they might not have fully considered the long-term implications of their actions. The friend's lack of remorse is a red flag, but escalating the situation to parents might be a way to enforce accountability. Still, it's not the most mature approach. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The friend definitely said something hurtful, but the author's response involves a breach of privacy. If the author had first tried to address it directly and failed, maybe then escalating would make sense. But in this case, the author is considering skipping that step and going straight to involving the parents. That could be seen as inconsiderate of their friendship and the trust they've built. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They have valid reasons to be upset, but their chosen method might not be the best. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're choosing an underhanded approach to handle the situation instead of addressing it more directly and respectfully. However, if the friend showed no remorse, maybe the author is justified. But the method of sending to a parent without trying to talk it out first is questionable. So leaning towards A.\n"
