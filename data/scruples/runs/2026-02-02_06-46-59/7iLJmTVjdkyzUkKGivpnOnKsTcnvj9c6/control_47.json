All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has lupus, leading to significant health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend made a degrading comment about the author's girlfriend, specifically targeting her weight due to her medical condition. The author responds by sending a screenshot of this message to the friend's mom. The key question here is whether the author's action is justified or if they crossed a line.\n\nThe friend's initial comment was clearly inappropriate and showed a lack of empathy, especially considering the girlfriend's medical struggles. The author felt wronged and was trying to address the situation. However, instead of confronting the friend directly or involving others in a more appropriate manner, the author chose to escalate by sharing the offensive message with the friend's parent. \n\nNow, considering the ethics of this action. The author's intent was likely to hold the friend accountable and perhaps teach him a lesson. However, sharing private messages without consent can be seen as a violation of privacy. Even though the friend's comment was hurtful, the author's response might be considered an overstep. The author could have documented the message and approached the friend or a teacher, or discussed it with friends to address it collectively. Instead, sending it directly to the friend's mom bypasses the friend and could be seen as a form of retaliation rather than a constructive resolution.\n\nAlso, the context mentions that other friends were present and didn't take sides. The author might have felt isolated, but using a screenshot to inform the parent could damage relationships and potentially lead to unintended consequences, like the friend's mom overreacting or the situation becoming more hostile. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend showed no remorse, which complicates things. The author's action could be seen as an attempt to get the friend to face the consequences of his actions through his parent. However, the method used (without the friend's knowledge) is problematic. It's a private communication being shared without consent, which is generally not advisable unless there's a clear risk of harm, which there isn't in this case\u2014it's more about accountability for a hurtful joke.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action, while understandable given the context, is ethically questionable. The appropriate response would have been to address the friend directly, seek support from friends or authorities in a more constructive way, rather than involving the parent through a screenshot. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for violating the friend's privacy in this manner.\n"
