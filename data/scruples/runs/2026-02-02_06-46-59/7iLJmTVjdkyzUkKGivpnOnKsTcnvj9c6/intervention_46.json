All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend making a hurtful joke about his girlfriend undergoing chemo to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the friend made a cruel comment referencing the girlfriend's medical condition. The author confronts him, but the friend dismisses it. The author then takes a screenshot and considers sending it to the mom. The question is whether this action is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author has a valid reason to be upset, and the friend showed no remorse. The author might feel that escalating the situation is necessary to address the friend's behavior, especially since they've tried to handle it previously without success.\n\nOn the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of retaliation. It's a private communication, and the author might be overstepping by involving the friend's family. The friend's mom wasn't part of the conversation, so the author is introducing her to a conflict that started elsewhere. This could lead to further complications, like the friend feeling betrayed or the mother overreacting.\n\nThe author is also considering not escalating in front of other friends, which suggests they want to avoid public confrontation. However, using the friend's mom as a method to address the issue might not be the healthiest approach. It could damage the friendship irreparably and might not teach the friend to take responsibility for his actions if the mom handles it in a way that's not constructive.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they have a history of helping the friend hide things from his parents. This context is important because it shows a pattern of enabling behavior, which might have contributed to the friend's lack of accountability. However, the current situation is more serious due to the girlfriend's health issues, which the friend mocked.\n\nIn terms of morality, the line is thin. The author's intent is to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable, which is understandable. But the method (involving the friend's mother) could be seen as disproportionate or manipulative. It's possible the friend might learn from the consequences, but the author might also be acting out of anger rather than seeking a resolution.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's action, while driven by justified anger, could be viewed as crossing a boundary. The right approach might have been to confront the friend more directly, involve mutual friends, or seek mediation rather than directly involving the friend's parent without discussing it with others first. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it through more appropriate channels.\n"
