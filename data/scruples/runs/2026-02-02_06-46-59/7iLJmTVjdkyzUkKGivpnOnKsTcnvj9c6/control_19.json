All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a cruel joke about their girlfriend's health issues, and the author considering sending a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend made a comment targeting the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has serious health issues. The author responded in a way that was maybe a bit combative, but the friend escalated it by making a joke about the girlfriend's weight, which is related to her medical condition. The author is now considering reporting this to the friend's mom as a way to address the situation without escalating it in front of friends.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this action. Let's break down the elements. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and showed a lack of empathy. The author's response was to confront the friend, but when that didn't work, they're thinking of involving the friend's parents. \n\nNow, the ethical aspect here. Sending a screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of retaliation. However, the friend's comment was hurtful and targeted someone who's vulnerable. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. On the other hand, the author's initial response might have been a bit harsh, but the friend didn't apologize and continued with more offensive remarks. \n\nThe author is also considering not escalating further in front of friends, which shows they're trying to manage the situation carefully. The friends are unsure how to react, and the author feels the need to take action because the friend has no remorse. \n\nIs sending the screenshot to the friend's mom wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might argue it's an overstep because it's involving parents in a personal conflict, but others might see it as necessary to make the friend understand the severity of his words. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a cruel one about a sensitive health issue. The author's actions could be a way to show the parent the inappropriateness of the son's behavior, especially if the parent is unaware of the context. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be seen as retaliating, but the original insult was directed at their girlfriend during a vulnerable time. The line between self-defense and overreaction is thin here. The key is whether the author's action is morally wrong. Considering the context, the friend's lack of remorse, and the serious nature of the joke, the author's intention to address it by involving parents might be justified. \n\nSo the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong because they are responding to a hurtful comment targeting someone who is already suffering, and their actions are aimed at holding the friend accountable without public escalation.\n"
