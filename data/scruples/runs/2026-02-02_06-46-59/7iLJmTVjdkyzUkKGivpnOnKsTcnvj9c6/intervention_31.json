All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo, and the author considering sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a comment targeting the girlfriend's weight, which is a sensitive issue because she's dealing with health problems. The author responds in a group chat, and the friend escalates the insult. The author is upset and considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to retaliate.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate. Let me break it down.\n\nThe friend's initial comment was clearly inappropriate and cruel, targeting someone with a health issue. The author was within their right to be upset. However, the author's response is to escalate by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. This action could be seen as a form of retaliation, which might not be the best approach. While the friend's actions were wrong, the author's method of addressing it could be problematic. \n\nBy sending it to the friend's mom, the author is involving a parent in a conflict that might be better handled directly between the individuals. The group chat context suggests that the friends are young (the author is 18), so maybe this is a situation where they're dealing with immaturity and lack of understanding about sensitive topics. \n\nThe author's motivation is to confront the friend without escalating in front of others, but using the mom as a middleman might not be the most constructive way. It could lead to further conflict, damage the friendship, and potentially cause unintended consequences for the friend. \n\nSo, while the friend definitely overstepped, the author's choice to retaliate by involving the parent might not be the right approach. The author is trying to stand up for their girlfriend, which is understandable, but the method could be questioned. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the response is more about revenge than a measured confrontation. However, it's a tricky situation where both parties have elements of wrongdoing. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend made the hurtful comment, but the author's action of sending the screenshot to the mom is the questionable part. Depending on cultural or personal views, some might say the author was justified in exposing the friend's cruelty. Others might say that it's a form of bullying or that it bypasses direct communication. \n\nIn many cases, the advice would be to address the issue directly with the friend first, perhaps with support from mutual friends, rather than involving parents without a clear purpose. So, the author's decision to send the screenshot could be considered wrong because it's an escalation that might not resolve the issue and could make things worse. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
