All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sending a screenshot of their friend making a derogatory comment about their girlfriend undergoing chemo to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a joke that targeted the author's girlfriend's weight, which is a sensitive issue because she's swelling from medical conditions. The author felt this was crossing a line and decided to send the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retribution. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nI should consider the key factors here. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate, targeting someone with a medical condition. That's a serious issue. However, the author's response was to involve the friend's mother, which could be seen as a privacy violation or an escalation. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. On the other, the author's method of addressing it might not be the best approach. Telling the friend's mom could have unintended consequences, like damaging relationships or not addressing the root issue. But given the severity of the comment, maybe the author felt justified.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that their friends are unsure how to handle the situation, so they might feel isolated. The question is whether sending the screenshot is the wrong move. If the friend had no remorse, maybe the author felt it was necessary to escalate.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the friend's comment was definitely wrong. The author's action is more about how they handled it. While the friend's actions were worse, the author's response could be seen as retaliatory. However, given the sensitivity of the situation with the girlfriend's health, maybe the author's intent was to stop further harm.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable, but the method might not be appropriate. However, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the seriousness of the comment, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But sending a screenshot to the mother without discussion might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the action could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the motive was good. Alternatively, B if the friend's actions were so egregious that the author's response is justified. But I think the key here is that the author's action is a privacy violation, hence A.\n"
