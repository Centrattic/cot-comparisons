All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong for threatening to send a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment to his mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through serious health issues. The author confronts the friend, but the friend is dismissive. The author is considering showing the friend's mom to get a reaction, possibly as a form of punishment or to make the friend take responsibility.\n\nNow, evaluating the ethics here. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and inappropriate, especially regarding someone with a serious illness. The author is upset and wants to hold the friend accountable. However, the method of doing so by involving the friend's mom could be seen as a privacy violation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial provocation was the friend's harmful joke. The author's response is a form of retaliation, which might be understandable given the context. But sending the screenshot to the mom could escalate the situation and potentially harm the friend's relationship with his mother. However, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, some might argue the author has valid grounds.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't the one who initiated the harmful behavior. On the other, using a parent's involvement might be seen as crossing a line, even if the motive is to correct the friend's behavior. The author could be in the wrong for using a private message to a parent as a form of punishment, but the initial harm was done by the friend. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut given that the friend was dismissive and the author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, the author's intent is to stop further harm. The action might not be morally perfect, but the core issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's retaliation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
