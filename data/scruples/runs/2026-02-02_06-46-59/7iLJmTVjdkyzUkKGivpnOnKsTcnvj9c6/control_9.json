All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who is undergoing chemo and dealing with serious health issues. The joke was about her weight and health, which is clearly sensitive. The friend showed no remorse and even dismissed the author's complaint by saying \"Don't talk shit then.\"\n\nThe author is considering taking the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue. The friends in the group chat aren't taking sides, and there's a history of helping the friend hide things from his parents. The author is conflicted between escalating the situation and wanting to protect their girlfriend's feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, confronting someone for making a hurtful joke, especially about a person's health, can be justified. The friend's comment was not only mean but also targeted a vulnerable situation. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking responsibility, so escalating to a parent could be a way to make the friend understand the severity.\n\nOn the other hand, sending screenshots to a parent without considering the potential consequences might be seen as a breach of trust or overstepping. However, given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the joke, the author's action could be viewed as a necessary step to address the harm caused.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while it's generally advisable to handle such issues directly with the person involved, the circumstances here are extreme. The friend's behavior was inappropriate, and the author might feel that other avenues (like talking to friends or the friend's parents) are the only options left. The key points are the lack of remorse from the friend and the severity of the joke. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to hold the friend accountable for a hurtful comment. The answer would be B (No).\n"
