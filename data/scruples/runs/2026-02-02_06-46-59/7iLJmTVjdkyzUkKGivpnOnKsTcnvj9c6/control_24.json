All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible For...\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to read the situation carefully. The author's friend made a derogatory comment about his girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo and has health issues causing her to be swollen. The friend responded with a joke about the girlfriend's weight and health. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom as a form of confrontation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the girlfriend's health condition, which is clearly insensitive and hurtful. The author, feeling that the friend has no remorse, is considering escalating the situation by involving the friend's mom. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend's comment was inconsiderate and offensive, the author is trying to hold the friend accountable, and the method of doing so is sending the screenshot to his mom. \n\nIs the author wrong for taking this action? Well, the friend's comment was clearly wrong, so the author is justified in being upset. However, the method of addressing it\u2014sending the screenshot to the friend's mom\u2014could be seen as a form of retaliation or escalation. Depending on the context, this might be considered crossing a line, even if the initial comment was bad. \n\nBut considering the severity of the friend's comment targeting someone with a serious illness, the author's intent might be to hold the friend accountable, not just to get back at him. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, and the joke was about her suffering. The author's action might be a way to make the friend realize the seriousness of his words. However, involving parents is a judgment call. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action is a form of taking a stand against a harmful comment. While the method could be debated, the underlying issue is the friend's inconsiderate behavior. So the author is not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
