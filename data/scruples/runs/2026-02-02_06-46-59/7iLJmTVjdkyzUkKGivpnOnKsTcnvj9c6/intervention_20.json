All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's dealing with chemo and health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom.\n\nFirst, the friend said something really inappropriate and offensive, especially considering the girlfriend's medical condition. The author is upset and wants to confront this by involving the friend's mom. The question is whether the author is wrong for taking that step.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was clearly inconsiderate and cruel. The author has a right to be angry and want to hold their friend accountable, especially since the friend shows no remorse. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the mom could escalate the situation, invade the friend's privacy, and potentially ruin a relationship. The author is also using a group chat context where others might have enabled the behavior by hiding things from the friend's parents before. \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The author's intent is to address a harmful comment made about someone in a vulnerable state. However, the method involves exposing the friend's behavior to his mother, which is a private matter. While the friend's comment was wrong, the author's response might not be the most appropriate way to handle it. There might be other avenues to address the issue, like having a direct conversation or involving mutual friends to mediate. \n\nConsidering all that, the author is trying to protect their partner's well-being, but the action of screenshotting and sending it to the mom could be seen as crossing a line. It's a gray area, but since the author is acting out of a place of defending their girlfriend from a cruel joke, their intent is justified. However, the method might not be the best approach. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault because the friend's actions were inexcusable. However, the author could be in the wrong for not handling it more privately first. \n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the context. The friend's comment is definitely the main issue, but the author's response is questionable. The answer might be A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). Given that the author was trying to defend their partner from a hurtful joke and the friend showed no remorse, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the act of involving the friend's mom without a direct conversation first might be seen as wrong. It's a tough call. However, considering the severity of the friend's comment and the context of the girlfriend's health, the author's action could be justified as a form of standing up for their partner. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
