All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is: the author's friend made a really offensive comment in a group chat about the author's girlfriend, who is going through chemo and has health issues leading to swelling. The author responded by sending a screenshot of the comment to the friend's mom. The friend then said, \"Don't talk shit then,\" showing no remorse. The author is considering whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the friend's actions. Insulting someone with a serious illness, especially in a group chat where others are present, is clearly wrong. The comment about the girlfriend's weight and health is cruel and insensitive. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" suggests a lack of empathy and accountability, which is problematic.\n\nNow, the author's action was to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. Is this justified? Well, the friend's comment was hurtful and targeted a vulnerable person. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. However, forwarding the message to the mom might be seen as a breach of privacy, as it involves sharing a private conversation without consent. But given the context of the friend's harmful behavior, the author might be trying to address it through a higher authority, which can sometimes be necessary, especially if the friend isn't taking responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the group chat scenario means the comments were already in a semi-public space among friends. The author might have a right to seek intervention if the friend's actions are toxic. The line here is between privacy and the need to stop bullying. Chemo is a serious health issue, and making fun of someone's medical condition is not just a joke. The author's intent was to stop further harm, but the method of escalating to the mom could be seen as a bit of a revenge tactic. However, given the severity of the comment, maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they usually help the kid hide things from his parents, so there's a pattern of enabling. This might mean the friend is used to getting away with things, so the author's action could be a way to break that cycle. The key is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to protect their girlfriend. Since the friend didn't apologize, perhaps informing the mom is a way to make him take responsibility. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for doing this? It's a tough call. While the friend's behavior is clearly wrong, the author's action might be considered a breach of trust, even if it's to prevent further harm. However, in cases where someone is being targeted with cruel comments, especially related to their health, some people might argue that the author has a duty to protect their girlfriend. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), because the author's girlfriend is being harassed in a private group chat, and the friend is unrepentant. Sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is a way to address the issue when the friend isn't taking responsibility, and the comments were already in a shared space. The severity of the health issues makes the comment even more hurtful, so the author's intent was to protect their girlfriend. It's not ideal, but it might be understandable given the circumstances. The main wrong here is the friend's actions, not the author's.\n"
