All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a joke about their girlfriend's health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's friend made a comment about the girlfriend, who's going through chemo, lupus, and kidney issues, leading to her being swollen and bloated. The friend's comment was \"That\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400-pound fatass girlfriend.\" The author is considering sending a screenshot of this comment to the friend's mom.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend's comment is clearly hurtful and targets the girlfriend's medical condition. The author is upset and wants to address it. The options given are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nIn terms of ethics, the friend's comment is offensive and shows no consideration for the girlfriend's health. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend and confront the friend's behavior. However, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a breach of privacy or an escalation. But given that the friend shows no remorse and the comment is cruel, the author's intent might be to get the parent involved to correct the behavior.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? The friend's actions were the initial wrongdoing. The author is reacting to defend their partner's dignity. However, the method of confronting the issue by involving the mother might not be the best approach, but the intent is to address a serious issue. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their girlfriend against a hurtful and cruel joke. The friend's behavior is the problem here. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
