All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of a friend making a joke about their girlfriend undergoing chemo to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend made a hurtful comment targeting the author's girlfriend, who's dealing with serious health issues. The author felt this comment was in poor taste and wanted to address it. Instead of confronting the friend directly in front of others, the author considered sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to avoid escalating things in front of mutual friends. \n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. The friend's comment was definitely inappropriate and cruel, given the girlfriend's condition. The author had a valid reason to be upset. However, the method of addressing it\u2014sending a screenshot to the mom\u2014might be problematic. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to hold the friend accountable for his insensitive remarks. On the other hand, contacting the parent without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a violation of privacy or an overstep. The author might have other avenues, like a direct confrontation or involving a mutual adult, but they're considering this option because they feel the friend has no remorse.\n\nThe key here is whether the action is justified. The friend's comment was hurtful, but retaliating by informing the parent could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's meant to humiliate or punish the friend. It's a gray area. Some might argue the author is justified in defending their girlfriend's dignity, while others might say it's not their place to involve the parent without a clear consequence.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the individuals (18 years old), they might be young and not fully grasp the implications of their actions. The author's intention is to address the friend's behavior, but the method could be seen as vindictive rather than constructive.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's comment was wrong, the author's response might be viewed as inconsiderate or excessive, depending on the context. The right approach might be to confront the friend directly or seek mediation, but sending a screenshot to the mom could be seen as the author overstepping. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for the method they chose, even if the initial issue was valid.\n"
