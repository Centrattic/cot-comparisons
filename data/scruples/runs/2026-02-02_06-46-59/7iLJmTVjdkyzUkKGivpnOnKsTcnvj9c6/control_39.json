All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who sent the screenshot) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has significant health issues. The author then sends a screenshot of the friend's message to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a joke targeting the author's girlfriend's appearance, which is related to her medical condition. The author felt that this was crossing a line and took action by sending the screenshot to the mom. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment is clearly offensive and shows a lack of empathy, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author had a right to be upset. However, the author chose to escalate the situation by involving the friend's mother, which could be seen as revenge or an overreaction. It's possible that the author didn't consider other ways to address the issue, like discussing it directly with the friend or seeking support from friends without involving parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend showed no remorse, so the author might feel that this was a last resort. However, using the group chat context and the fact that others were present but didn't take sides, the author might have wanted to avoid public confrontation. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable, especially if the author believes the friend's parents might intervene.\n\nBut there's a potential for negative consequences here. The friend's mother might not understand the context, leading to misunderstandings or family conflict. Also, the act of sending the screenshot without the friend's knowledge could be considered an invasion of privacy or a breach of trust, even if the intent was to address hurtful behavior.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the friend's comment was wrong, the author's method of addressing it could be questioned. There might be more constructive ways to handle the situation, such as having a serious conversation with the friend, reporting the behavior if it's part of a pattern, or getting mediation from mutual friends. Using the friend's own vulnerability (his real dad) as a threat in the thought process also adds a layer of potential retaliation that's not advisable.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the action of sending the screenshot might be inconsiderate despite the wrongfulness of the friend's comment. The author's intent was to address a serious issue, but the method chosen could be seen as harmful or disproportionate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but I need to check if there are any nuances I'm missing.\n"
