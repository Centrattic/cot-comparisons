All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sending a screenshot of a friend's offensive comment about the author's girlfriend, who has health issues, to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, the context matters. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the author's girlfriend during chemo, which caused her significant weight gain due to medical conditions. The friend's comment was clearly insensitive and crossed a line, as the author points out.\n\nNow, the author's response was to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. Let's consider the moral and practical implications. \n\nThe friend made a harmful joke, showing no remorse. The author felt justified in escalating the situation by involving the friend's mother. However, bypassing the friend and directly reporting the comment to the mom could be seen as an overstep, especially if the author didn't give the friend a chance to apologize or if the author didn't address it privately first. \n\nBut considering the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, the author might feel that their options were limited. The friend's actions were malicious, and the author's girlfriend is vulnerable. However, the author could have handled it differently, perhaps by confronting the friend first or involving mutual friends. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, the author might not be in the wrong because the friend's behavior was inexcusable. But ethically, sending the screenshot to the mom without prior communication could be seen as an escalation. However, given the friend's lack of accountability, the author's actions might be a form of self-defense for their partner's dignity. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's action was a reasonable response to the friend's inconsiderate behavior. While the author's method could have been better, the underlying issue is the friend's cruelty. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the friend had a history of such behavior and the author didn't address it privately first, maybe. In this case, since the friend showed no remorse and the comment was about a vulnerable person, the author's response could be justified. \n\nBut let me check again. The author says the friend made a joke about their girlfriend's medical condition, which is extremely sensitive. The friend's comment was not just a joke but a personal attack. The author's response was to send the screenshot to the mom. If the author first tried to address it with the friend and the friend dismissed it, then escalating might be reasonable. However, if the author didn't give the friend a chance to apologize, it might be a problem. \n\nIn the scenario, the author told the friend he went too far, and the friend responded with \"Don't talk shit then,\" which indicates no remorse. So the author tried to address it directly first. Given that, sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a justified step to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend has a history of making others hide things from their parents. \n\nTherefore, considering the context, the author might not be in the wrong because the friend's actions were inexcusable, and the author acted to protect their girlfriend and seek accountability. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author should have handled it another way. However, given the lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the comment, the author's action is understandable.\n"
