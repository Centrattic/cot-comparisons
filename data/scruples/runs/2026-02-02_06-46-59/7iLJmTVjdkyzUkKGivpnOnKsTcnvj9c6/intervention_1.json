All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment about his girlfriend to his mom. The friend made a cruel joke about the girlfriend's condition, which is related to her chemo and lupus. The author was in a group chat, and after the friend made the comment, he sent a screenshot to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was targeting the author's girlfriend, who is seriously ill. The friend's response was not only rude but also insensitive to her health issues. The author felt that the friend had no remorse, so they took the screenshot to his mom, possibly to show her what happened.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author's action might be seen as a form of accountability, especially if the friend is showing no remorse. However, sending the screenshot to his mom could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the friend's behavior was wrong. The author might have escalated the situation by involving the friend's parent, which could lead to unintended consequences.\n\nBut then again, the original offense was severe. The friend's comment was a direct attack on the girlfriend's health, which is a serious matter. The author might feel that this action was necessary to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend dismissed the author's concerns. The group chat friends didn't take a side, so the author might not have support from them.\n\nHowever, the act of forwarding the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a violation of privacy. Even though the friend was being a jerk, the author might have other ways to address it, like confronting the friend directly without involving his mom. But given the friend's lack of remorse, maybe the author felt that this was the only way to make him understand the seriousness of his actions.\n\nSo, the key points are the severity of the original comment and the method of responding. The author's action is a form of retaliation, but is it justified? If the friend's comment was malicious and the author tried to address it and failed, then maybe the action is understandable. However, the act of showing the mom could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author didn't give the friend a proper chance to apologize or if it's not the right way to handle conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's behavior was inexcusable, the author's method of response might be considered wrong because it's a private matter and could lead to more conflict without resolving the issue. The right approach might be to address it directly with the friend first, and if that fails, perhaps seek mediation or other means rather than involving the parent. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
