All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The friend's comments are clearly insensitive and cruel, given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author's girlfriend has a serious illness, so the friend's joke about her weight is not only offensive but potentially hurtful. The friend shows no remorse, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe author's response is to consider sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. On one hand, this could be seen as a form of confrontation or seeking accountability. But is it justified? The author mentions that they all hide things from the friend's parents usually, implying there's a history of covering for him. However, this time the comment is about a sensitive health issue, so the author might feel it's necessary to take action.\n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong. B says not. The key here is whether the author's action is justified. The friend's comment was inappropriate, and the author is trying to address it without escalating in front of others. Sending the screenshot to the mom might be seen as a way to let the friend's parents know, even if it's not the most direct method. However, is it the author's responsibility to do this? Alternatively, maybe the author should talk to the friend directly or involve someone else.\n\nBut given the friend's lack of remorse, the author might not feel that direct confrontation would help. In such cases, seeking support from a parent could be a way to address the issue. The author's intent is to hold the friend accountable for his harmful comment. While it's a private action, if the friend's parents are aware of his behavior, they might have a role in addressing it. So, in this context, the author might not be in the wrong because the friend's comment was hurtful and the author is trying to address it, albeit in a way that could have unintended consequences.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is using a method that others might see as snitching or escalating the issue. The friend's parents might not be informed, so the action is a form of personal justice. However, considering the severity of the comment, the author's action could be justified as a protective measure for his girlfriend and himself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action, while perhaps not the most conventional, might be seen as a justified response to a hurtful and insensitive comment, especially given the friend's lack of remorse. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
