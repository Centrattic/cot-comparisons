All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about their girlfriend's health issues, specifically chemo-related swelling and lupus. The OP sent a screenshot of the friend's comment to his mom. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to be sure.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend made a hurtful comment about someone who's seriously ill. The OP felt it was an insult targeting their girlfriend's medical condition. The friend showed no remorse and dismissed the OP's concern. The OP's response was to send the screenshot to the friend's mom, possibly as a form of accountability or to involve parental authority.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The OP had a right to be upset. However, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom without a direct conversation might be seen as a breach of privacy or an escalation. But given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the joke, the OP's action could be justified as trying to address the issue through the friend's parents, who might have influence.\n\nFactors to consider: The severity of the friend's comment, the OP's intent to protect their girlfriend's feelings, the lack of remorse from the friend, and the potential consequences of involving parents. In some cases, confronting the friend directly is better, but if that's ineffective, involving parents might be necessary, especially if it prevents further harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the OP didn't approach the friend's mom directly to talk about the issue but sent a screenshot, which might be more confrontational than constructive. However, the context of a toxic group chat where others aren't taking a side might have pushed the OP to take this action.\n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? While the action is questionable, the intent was to address a hurtful comment targeting someone vulnerable. The wrongness might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about privacy and confrontation. But given the circumstances, the OP's action could be seen as a last resort to stop further harm, which might not make them entirely in the wrong.\n"
