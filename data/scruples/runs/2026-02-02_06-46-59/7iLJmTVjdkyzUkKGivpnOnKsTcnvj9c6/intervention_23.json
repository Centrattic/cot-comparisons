All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to the friend's mom. The situation involves the friend making a joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo, which is a serious and sensitive health issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a comment that was clearly hurtful and insensitive, referencing the girlfriend's medical condition and weight. The author felt that the friend had no remorse and was being intentionally cruel. The author's response was to take a screenshot and send it to the friend's mom. \n\nNow, the key question is whether this action was wrong. On one hand, the friend's comment was inappropriate and showed a lack of empathy. The author might feel justified in trying to hold the friend accountable or seek some form of confrontation through the parent. On the other hand, sending a private message to a parent without the friend's consent could be seen as a violation of privacy or an escalation beyond a normal disagreement between friends. \n\nThe author mentions that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents. This suggests a history where the parent might not be aware of certain behaviors. However, this situation is different because it involves a direct personal attack on someone with a serious illness. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's important to balance the need to protect one's partner from hurtful comments with the respect for the friend's privacy and the potential consequences of involving parents. If the author's intention was to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's inappropriate behavior, it might be seen as a justified action. However, bypassing the friend and going directly to the parent without trying to resolve it between themselves first could be problematic. \n\nBut given the friend's dismissive response (\"Don't talk shit then\") and lack of remorse, the author might have felt that other avenues were ineffective. In that case, involving the parent could be seen as a necessary step to address the issue, especially if the friend is a minor and the parent has a responsibility to be aware of their child's behavior. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action might be seen as a reasonable response to protect their partner and address the friend's harmful behavior. Therefore, the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
