All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original situation is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, the context: the friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author confronts the friend, who dismisses it by saying \"Don't talk shit then.\" The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of retaliation, possibly to get the friend in trouble or make him stop.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the elements. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author has tried to address it directly but the friend showed no remorse. The author's options are limited: either escalate with the friend's parents or let it slide. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to defend their girlfriend and themselves. The friend's behavior is inappropriate and shows a lack of empathy. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to the friend's mom might be seen as a breach of privacy or an overstep if the author isn't the one being targeted. However, the friend's comment targeted the girlfriend, who is a vulnerable individual. \n\nMoral considerations: Is it justified to involve the friend's parents? The author might be using the screenshot to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend has no remorse. The friends in the group chat don't take sides, so the author feels isolated. The alternative mentioned is bringing up the friend's real dad leaving him, which could be personal and counterproductive. \n\nLegal considerations: The comment was made in a group chat, so sharing it with the friend's mom could be seen as sharing private messages, which might have legal implications depending on jurisdiction. However, the context here is more about ethical considerations. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is protecting their girlfriend's dignity and health from a cruel joke. The action is a response to a violation of trust and respect. While it's a private matter, the severity of the comment and the friend's lack of remorse might justify the author's actions. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have handled it through direct confrontation or involving another authority figure, rather than involving the parents. But given the friend's dismissive attitude, the author might feel that this is the only way to make him understand the seriousness of his words. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author's intent is to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. While the method might be controversial, the underlying issue is serious. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
