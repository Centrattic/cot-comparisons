All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a joke about their girlfriend undergoing chemo to that friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend made a comment in a group chat that was clearly offensive and insensitive. The author's girlfriend has a serious medical condition, and the friend made a joke about her weight gain due to chemo. The author confronted the friend, but the friend dismissed them. Now, the author is considering sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom as a way to get back at him, especially since they usually cover for each other.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. The friend's comment was cruel and targeted the author's girlfriend's health condition. That's definitely wrong. The author tried to address it directly but didn't get a satisfactory response. Now, the author is considering escalating the conflict by exposing the friend's comment to his mom. \n\nIs this the right move? Well, the friend was being insensitive, but sending the screenshot to his mom could be seen as a form of revenge or retaliation. Even if the friend's comment was wrong, the author's action might bypass the usual group of friends and involve the parents, which could strain relationships. However, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the context of the girlfriend's health, the author might feel that this is necessary to hold the friend accountable. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was inexcusable, and the author has a right to be upset. On the other hand, the author's response might be seen as disproportionate or using a private message against the friend to get back at him for past issues, like hiding things from parents. The author's intent here is to teach the friend a lesson, but the method involves public shaming or exposing a private conversation, which could have its own negative consequences.\n\nI need to consider if the author's action is justified. The friend's comment was harmful, but the author's response might not be the best approach. Instead of confronting the friend directly in front of others, sending it to his mom could lead to more conflict. However, given the friend's history of making offensive remarks without remorse, maybe the author feels that this is the only way to make him understand the severity of his words.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the action is taken to protect their girlfriend's feelings and hold the friend accountable, maybe it's understandable. However, using a private message in this way could be seen as a breach of trust and an escalation. The author might be overstepping by involving the parents when there's no prior attempt to resolve it through the group or with the friend's parents in a constructive way. \n\nAlternatively, if the friend's mom is aware of his behavior and this action could lead to the friend facing consequences, it might be justified. But if the author is doing this out of spite or to get back at the friend for hiding things, then it's more about retaliation. The line here is whether the action is a proportionate response to the friend's inconsiderate comment versus using it as a tool for revenge.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's comment was clearly wrong, the author's method of addressing it might not be the most appropriate. However, given the context of the friend's lack of remorse and the sensitive nature of the girlfriend's health, the author's intention might be to highlight the seriousness of the friend's words. Yet, sending a screenshot to his mom could be seen as crossing a line, making the author in the wrong. So, the answer would be A.\n"
