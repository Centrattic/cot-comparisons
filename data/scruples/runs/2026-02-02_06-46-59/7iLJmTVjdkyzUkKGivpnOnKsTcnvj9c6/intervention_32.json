All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. The situation involves the friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful, targeting the girlfriend's medical condition. The author tried to address it directly but the friend dismissed it. The author then escalated by involving the friend's mom, which could be seen as a form of revenge or trying to get the friend in trouble. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior was inconsiderate and hurtful. On the other hand, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line by using a screenshot to report the friend to his mom, especially if it's done secretly. The key points here are intent, proportionality, and the potential consequences. \n\nThe author's intention was to address the friend's inappropriate comments, but using a screenshot to involve the friend's parent might not be the most constructive approach. It could damage the friendship and potentially lead to more conflict. However, given the severity of the comment and the girlfriend's health struggles, some might argue the author had valid reasons to act. \n\nBut generally, reporting someone to their parent without a clear justification or warning could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The author might have other options, like confronting the friend again more firmly or involving mutual friends. Since the friend showed no remorse, maybe the author felt it was necessary to take stronger action. Still, the method of using a screenshot without a prior serious warning could be considered the wrong approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be in the wrong because they escalated the situation in a way that bypasses direct communication and involves third parties without exhausting other options first. But there are mitigating factors because the friend's comment was extremely inappropriate. However, the standard answer here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they took it to the parent immediately rather than giving the friend another chance to apologize or address it through other means.\n"
