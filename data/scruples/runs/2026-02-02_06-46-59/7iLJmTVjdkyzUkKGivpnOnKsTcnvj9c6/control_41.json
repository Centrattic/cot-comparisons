All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to screenshot their friend's offensive message to send to his mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's going through chemo and has health issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the friend's actions. He made a joke that's not just mean but directly targets the author's girlfriend's medical condition. That's clearly inappropriate and shows a lack of empathy. The author tried to address it, but the friend doubled down, showing no remorse.\n\nNow, the author's response is to consider sharing the screenshot with the friend's mom. The question is whether this is justified. On one hand, the friend's comment was hurtful and inconsiderate. On the other hand, escalating the situation by involving the mom could be seen as a privacy violation or revenge. But given the context of the group chat, where they often hide things from parents, the author might feel justified in using this as a way to hold the friend accountable without further confrontation in front of others.\n\nThe author isn't retaliating with the same kind of personal attack (like mentioning the friend's dad) but is instead using evidence of the friend's own behavior. While it's a form of escalation, the initial offense was severe and the friend showed no remorse, which might make the author's action understandable. However, it's still a private matter and might not be the best approach. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the friend's actions were worse. The author is reacting to a serious breach of respect towards someone vulnerable. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The answer is B.\n"
