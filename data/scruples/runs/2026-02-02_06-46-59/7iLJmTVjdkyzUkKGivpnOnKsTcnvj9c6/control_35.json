All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA question is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend making a joke about their girlfriend's medical condition to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's friend made a cruel joke in a group chat about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has lupus. The friend's comment was offensive, targeting her weight gain due to medical issues. The author confronted the friend, who dismissed it, showing no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the situation without escalating it in front of others.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of the friend's comment, the context of the girlfriend's health issues, and the potential consequences of the author's action. The friend's joke was not just a joke; it was a cruel and insensitive remark targeting someone with serious health problems. The author's reaction was to protect their girlfriend and confront the friend, who didn't take it seriously.\n\nNow, the question is whether sending the screenshot to the friend's mom is wrong. The author is trying to avoid public escalation but wants to address the issue. Sending the evidence to a parent could be seen as a form of accountability, especially if the friend isn't taking responsibility. However, it's also invading the friend's privacy and bypassing direct communication. \n\nBut considering the friend's lack of remorse and the cruelty of the comment, the author's action might be justified as protecting their vulnerable partner. The author's intent is to hold the friend accountable, not to harm him. The friend's actions were harmful, and the author might feel that this is a necessary step since the friend isn't changing his behavior.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that the author should have addressed it directly first. But given that the friend dismissed the author's initial confrontation, and the situation involves a serious medical issue, the author might feel justified in seeking outside help to prevent further harm. The parents have a role in their child's behavior, so involving them could be seen as a responsible step rather than just gossiping.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The author is trying to protect someone in a vulnerable state, which is commendable, but the method of involving the friend's mom without a direct conversation might be seen as underhanded. However, given the context of the friend's unapologetic behavior, the author's action might be the only way to make a difference. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because the friend's actions were inexcusably cruel, and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable despite the friend's lack of remorse.\n"
