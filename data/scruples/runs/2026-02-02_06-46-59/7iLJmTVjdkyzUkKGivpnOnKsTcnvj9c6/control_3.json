All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that this person's friend made a really hurtful comment about their girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The friend said something about her weight, which is a sensitive topic because of her medical condition. The author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and cruel, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author tried to confront the friend in the group chat, but the friend didn't show remorse and dismissed the author. Now the author is thinking of escalating by sending the screenshot to the mom, which is a private action. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, the friend's actions were harmful. Sending the screenshot to the mom could be seen as a way to hold the friend accountable, especially since the friend isn't taking responsibility. However, doing so without the friend's knowledge might be considered a breach of privacy or an act of revenge. The author is also exploiting a trust that they might have with their other friends, who help hide things from parents. \n\nBut considering the severity of the comment and the girlfriend's health, the author's anger is understandable. They might feel that their friend's behavior is toxic and needs to be addressed. However, the method of addressing it by involving the parent without a direct confrontation might be problematic. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and address a hurtful comment. But using a screenshot to inform the friend's mom could be seen as crossing a line, as it's a personal matter and might not be the best way to resolve the issue. The author could be in the wrong if they bypass the friend's right to privacy and accountability in a more direct way, like talking to the friend's parents themselves or seeking mediation. However, given the friend's dismissive attitude, the author might feel that other options aren't effective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might depend on cultural or ethical standards, but given that the friend's comment was so inappropriate, the author's actions could be seen as a justified response to protect their partner. But since they're using a screenshot to get the friend in trouble without a direct conversation, maybe that's where the line is crossed. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the comment was hurtful and the author is trying to address it, even if the method is questionable. But maybe the action is still wrong because of the privacy aspect. I'm a bit torn here.\n"
