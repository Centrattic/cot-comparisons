All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wants to take a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to show his mom is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and is swollen due to her medical condition. The joke was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author responded by telling the friend he went too far, but the friend dismissed it. \n\nThe author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the context. The friend's comment was cruel and targeted someone who's already suffering. The author is upset and wants to hold the friend accountable. However, taking the screenshot to the parent might escalate the situation, but the friend showed no remorse. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, the author tried to address the friend directly first. Since the friend didn't take it seriously, maybe the author is within their rights to involve the parent, especially since the friend might not face consequences otherwise. \n\nBut there's a line between defending a loved one and escalating conflicts. However, given the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse, the author's actions might be seen as a reasonable response to protect their girlfriend and seek justice. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were inconsiderate and the author is trying to address it after exhausting direct communication.\n"
