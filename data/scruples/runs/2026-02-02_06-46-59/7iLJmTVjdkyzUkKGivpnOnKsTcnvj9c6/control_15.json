All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wants to send a screenshot of a friend's offensive message to his mom is in the wrong. The situation involves the friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who's undergoing chemo and has a medical condition causing her to be swollen. The friend not only called the girlfriend a \"bitch\" but then made a comment about her weight, which the author knows is sensitive due to her health issues. The author confronts the friend, who shows no remorse. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to escalate the situation without doing it in front of others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comments were clearly hurtful and targeted someone with a medical condition. The author is trying to protect their girlfriend's feelings and also hold the friend accountable. However, the method of taking it to the friend's mom instead of addressing it directly might be seen as passive-aggressive or escalating the conflict behind the friend's back. But on the other hand, the friend's behavior was inappropriate, and the author might feel that the friend isn't taking it seriously. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comments were definitely in the wrong. The author's response was to confront him, which is reasonable. Choosing to involve the friend's mom might be seen as taking the matter further than necessary, but given the friend's lack of remorse, maybe it's justified. However, sending a screenshot could be considered a breach of privacy if the group chat wasn't public, and it might lead to unintended consequences. The author's intention is to address the friend's behavior, but the method could be problematic. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comments were malicious and harmful. On the other, the author's action might be seen as retaliatory or using a third party unnecessarily. But considering the context of the girlfriend's health struggles and the friend's refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing, the author might feel that this is the only way to make an impact. The other friends are also present but haven't taken a side, which might indicate a toxic environment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The friend's actions were worse, but the author's method of handling it could be questioned. However, given the circumstances, the author's action might be a last resort. The key is whether the action is justified. The friend's comments were harmful, and the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's a debate here about the appropriate way to handle it. \n\nThe answer is probably B (No), because the friend's actions were worse, and the author is acting to protect someone being targeted. However, using a screenshot to a parent might not be the best approach, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to address the issue.\n"
