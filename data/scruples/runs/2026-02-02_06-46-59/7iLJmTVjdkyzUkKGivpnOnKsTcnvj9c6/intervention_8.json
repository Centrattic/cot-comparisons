All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. The situation involves the friend mocking the author's girlfriend, who's going through a serious illness. The friend made a cruel joke about her weight, which is a result of her medical condition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly hurtful and insensitive, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author felt justified in wanting to confront this, but instead of addressing it directly with the friend, they took it to the friend's mom. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, the friend's behavior was definitely inappropriate. But the author's response\u2014sending a screenshot to the mom\u2014could be seen as a form of retaliation. They didn't give the friend a chance to apologize or address the issue maturely. Instead, they escalated it by involving the parent, possibly without considering the consequences. \n\nHowever, the friend showed no remorse after being confronted. The author might feel that their friend's lack of empathy makes their actions unforgivable. In such cases, people might feel justified in taking stronger actions if they believe there's no resolution through normal channels. \n\nBut is sending the screenshot to the mom a wrong move? It depends on the perspective. Some might argue that it's a form of betrayal since they're friends and supposed to handle conflicts themselves. Others might see it as a necessary step to hold someone accountable, especially if the friend's actions were malicious and he's not taking responsibility.\n\nThe author also mentions that they usually help the friend hide things from his parents. This adds another layer\u2014maybe the author is breaking their own unspoken rules by involving the parent now. That could make their action seem hypocritical or a breach of trust, even if the friend was at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the comment was directed at someone with a serious illness, which makes it more heinous. The author's girlfriend's condition is a significant factor here. The friend's joke wasn't just teasing; it was exploiting a sensitive health issue. \n\nSo, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for the initial comment, the author's method of addressing it is debatable. If the author had tried to resolve it directly first, that might have been better. But given the friend's hostile response and lack of remorse, the author might feel they had no other choice. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's action is a form of escalation. While the friend's behavior was unacceptable, the author's response might not be the best approach. However, it's not entirely clear that the author is in the wrong since the situation is complex. But considering the usual dynamics of their friendship and the lack of direct confrontation, there's a case to be made that the author is in the wrong for not addressing it more directly first.\n"
