All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues. The author tried to confront the friend, but the friend dismissed it. The author is considering taking a screenshot and sending it to the friend's mom to maybe get him in trouble, especially since they often help him hide things from his parents.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment was clearly insensitive and hurtful. The author's girlfriend is going through a tough time, and the joke about her health is really inappropriate. The friend shows no remorse, which adds to the problem. \n\nBut when it comes to the author's action of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, that's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the friend's behavior was wrong, and the author might feel that escalating it to the parents is necessary to make the friend stop. On the other hand, the author is using a method that involves exposing the friend's behavior without his consent. This could be seen as a breach of privacy or even revenge.\n\nHowever, considering the context of the group chat\u2014where they often help hide things from parents\u2014it might be a different scenario. The author is choosing to go against that norm here, possibly to protect their girlfriend's feelings and health. The friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment might justify the action in terms of seeking accountability.\n\nBut there's another angle: the author is taking it to the friend's mom without giving the friend a chance to address it properly. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like confronting the friend again or involving a mutual adult. But given the friend's response (\"Don't talk shit then\"), it seems like he's not going to take responsibility.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a tough call. The friend's actions were definitely wrong, and the author's intention is to stop further harm. Sending a screenshot to the mom could be seen as a necessary step to get the friend to face consequences. However, it's also possible that this could escalate tensions or cause unintended consequences for the friend. \n\nBut given the severity of the original comment and the fact that the author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, the author might not have felt they had other options. The friends in the group chat aren't taking sides, so the author is acting alone. \n\nIn conclusion, while the method might not be the most ideal, the intent is to protect someone who's already suffering. The author's actions are driven by a desire to prevent further hurt, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
