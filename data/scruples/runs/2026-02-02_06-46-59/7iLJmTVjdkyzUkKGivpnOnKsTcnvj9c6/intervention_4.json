All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend making a hurtful comment about his girlfriend who's going through chemo, and the author is considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend made a joke that targeted the author's girlfriend, who has serious health issues. The friend's remark was not just a general insult but specifically related to her medical condition. The author is upset and wants to retaliate by sharing the screenshot with the friend's mom, possibly to get him in trouble.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and cruel. Making fun of someone's medical condition, especially when they're vulnerable, is wrong. The author stands up for their girlfriend, which is understandable. However, the author is planning to send the screenshot to the friend's mom without the friend having a chance to apologize or explain. This could be seen as an escalation, using parental authority to shame or punish the friend.\n\nBut then, the friend showed no remorse and was dismissive. The author might feel that they've exhausted all avenues of addressing the issue directly. If the friend isn't taking responsibility, the author might believe that involving a parent is necessary to make him understand the seriousness of his actions. However, this could backfire, potentially damaging their friendship and possibly causing unnecessary stress to the friend's family.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of proportionality. The friend's comment was a verbal insult, but the author's response is a more severe action that could have lasting consequences. Is sending a screenshot to the mom a justifiable response? Or is it an overreaction that crosses a line? It could be argued that the author is trying to protect their girlfriend and address the insult, but the method might not be the right one.\n\nAlso, the group chat context is important. The friends were in a group chat where they usually help each other hide things from their parents. This might mean that the author is using a tactic they've been part of before, but in this case, the stakes are much higher. The friends haven't taken sides yet, so the author might feel isolated and want to take action to assert their position.\n\nMoral considerations: The friend's comment was wrong, but the author's method of retaliation might not be the best approach. There's a saying about not stooping to the level of the offender. If the author sends the screenshot, they might be using a similar tactic\u2014exposing the friend's mistake to his mom, which could be seen as vindictive rather than constructive.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend is unrepentant and the comment was targeted at a vulnerable person, the author's intent to protect their girlfriend is valid. However, the method of addressing it could be questioned. Maybe a better approach would be to report the comment to a teacher or authority figure if this is in a school setting, or to have a more direct confrontation in front of the group to make the friend aware of the impact of his words.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were clearly in the wrong, the author's response might also be problematic. The line between standing up for someone and taking it too far can be thin. The author's intent is to address a serious issue, but the method chosen could be seen as crossing into vengeful behavior. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong, but there are nuances. However, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the comment, some might argue the author is justified. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that sending a screenshot to a parent without considering consequences is a form of escalation that's not advisable, the answer is likely A.\n"
