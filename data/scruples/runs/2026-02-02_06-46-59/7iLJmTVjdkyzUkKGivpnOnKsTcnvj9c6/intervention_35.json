All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend making a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author then sends a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a cruel joke targeting the author's girlfriend during her health struggles. The author felt that this was crossing a line and decided to take action by sending the evidence to the friend's mother. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author's response was to escalate the situation by involving the friend's mom. But since the friend showed no remorse and the comment was about a vulnerable person, the author might feel justified in trying to hold the friend accountable. However, using friends to hide things from parents usually implies a level of secrecy, but when the friend is being abusive, that dynamic might change.\n\nThe key points are: the friend's comment was offensive and targeted someone in a vulnerable state. The author's action, while not the most diplomatic, could be seen as a way to address the harm done. However, the author is using a method that bypasses direct confrontation and involves the friend's family, which might be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if the group has a history of keeping things private. \n\nBut considering the severity of the comment and the lack of remorse from the friend, the author might feel that this was necessary to protect their girlfriend's feelings and to make the friend understand the seriousness of his words. In such cases, sometimes involving parents is seen as a last resort when other methods fail. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as a justified response to a harmful situation, especially when the friend isn't taking responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a better angle. However, some might argue that the author should have addressed it directly or sought support from friends first. But given the friend's dismissive attitude, the author's choice to involve the mom could be seen as a necessary step.\n"
