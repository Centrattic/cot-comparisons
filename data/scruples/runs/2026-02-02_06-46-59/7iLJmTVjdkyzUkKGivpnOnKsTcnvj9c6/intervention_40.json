All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The scenario is about sending a screenshot of a friend making a hurtful joke about their girlfriend's medical condition to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy's friend made a cruel comment about his girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious health issues. The guy confronts his friend, but the friend is dismissive. Now, the guy is considering sending a screenshot of the offensive message to the friend's mom to address the situation.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the friend's comment and the response the guy is considering. The friend's joke is about the girlfriend's medical condition, which is extremely sensitive. Making fun of someone's health, especially when they're battling something as severe as chemo and lupus, is clearly inappropriate and cruel. The guy's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, and the friend's comment is not just a joke but a form of bullying or harassment.\n\nNow, the author's actions: sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether this is justified or if it makes the author wrong. On one hand, the author is trying to hold the friend accountable for his harmful words. The friend showed no remorse and was dismissive, which might make the author feel that direct confrontation isn't effective. On the other hand, involving the friend's parent could be seen as an escalation, potentially violating privacy or trust if the group chat isn't public.\n\nBut considering the context, the friend's behavior was malicious and hurtful. The author's girlfriend is in a critical health situation, so the comment isn't just a joke\u2014it's a serious jab at her suffering. The author is trying to protect his partner and address the friend's behavior, which wasn't just a slip of the tongue but a deliberate, cruel remark. The friend's response (\"Don't talk shit then\") indicates he doesn't think his actions were wrong, which is a red flag.\n\nHowever, the act of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom without the friend's knowledge might be seen as a breach of privacy, especially if the group chat was meant to be between friends. But in this case, the friend's actions could arguably justify such a response, given the malicious intent and lack of remorse. The author might feel that the friend's behavior isn't something he should handle through normal channels, especially if the other friends aren't supporting the author.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is balancing accountability with privacy. But in cases of bullying or harmful speech, especially targeting someone with health issues, the line between privacy and protecting someone's well-being can blur. The author's intention is to stop the friend from making such comments again and maybe make him face consequences from his parent. If the friend's mom is unaware of his behavior, this action could help her address it.\n\nHowever, there's also a consideration of whether the author should have first tried to handle it privately with the friend or involved other friends. But since the friend was dismissive and the situation is severe, the author might feel that private confrontation wasn't enough. In that light, the action, while possibly harsh, is a response to a serious issue.\n\nSo, weighing the friend's cruel comment against the author's response, the author might not be in the wrong. The friend's behavior was inexcusable, and the author is trying to protect his girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but I need to be careful here. It's a tough call, but given the context, the friend's actions were worse. So B (the author is not in the wrong) might be the correct answer.\n"
