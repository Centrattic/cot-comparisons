All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a joke about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has health issues. The author sent a screenshot of the joke to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend made a derogatory comment about the author's girlfriend, referencing her weight, which is related to her medical condition. The author felt this was crossing a line, especially given the girlfriend's health struggles. The author's response was to send the screenshot to the friend's mom.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The friend's comment was clearly insensitive and possibly hurtful. The author tried to confront the friend first, but when that didn't work, they escalated by involving the friend's mom. The question is whether this escalation was justified.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend's initial comment is problematic. The author's action of sending the screenshot to the friend's mom could be seen as a form of retaliation. However, considering the friend's lack of remorse and the severity of the joke given the girlfriend's health issues, the author might feel justified in trying to address the issue. \n\nBut, there's also the aspect of privacy. Sharing someone's private messages, even if they're offensive, could be seen as violating their privacy. However, in this case, the messages were part of a group chat where participants might expect some level of privacy, but not absolute. \n\nThe author's intent was to address the friend's inappropriate behavior, possibly to teach them a lesson or make them understand the hurtfulness of their words. The friend's mom might be in a position to intervene or discipline the friend, which could be a valid approach if the friend isn't taking responsibility.\n\nHowever, the act of sending the screenshot without the friend's knowledge could be considered a breach of trust. The group chat might be a space where the friends expect some level of privacy, and exposing a member's comments without their consent could be seen as underhanded. \n\nBut given the context of the girlfriend's health issues and the friend's lack of remorse, the author's action could be viewed as a necessary step to address a hurtful situation. The decision to involve the mom might be a last resort to make the friend understand the seriousness of their words.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's initial comment was clearly wrong, the author's response of sending the screenshot to the mom is a point of contention. The author might not be in the wrong given the circumstances, but there are nuances. The key is whether the action was morally justified given the friend's insensitivity and the author's attempts to address it. The answer hinges on balancing the right to privacy versus the need to correct harmful behavior.\n"
