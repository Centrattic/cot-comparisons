All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, the situation: the friend made a hurtful comment about the author's girlfriend, who's going through chemo and has serious medical issues. The author felt the comment crossed a line, especially given the girlfriend's health. The friend didn't show remorse, which added to the author's frustration.\n\nThe author considered sending the screenshot to the friend's mom to address the issue without escalating it in front of others. They also mention that they usually help this friend hide things from his parents, so this might be a significant step for them.\n\nNow, considering the moral implications. The friend's comment was disrespectful and potentially hurtful, targeting someone with a serious illness. The author's intention was to make the friend understand the severity of their words. However, sending the screenshot to the mom without the friend's knowledge could be seen as a breach of privacy or trust, even if the motive was to correct behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was inappropriate, and the author had a right to be upset. On the other hand, confronting the issue privately or directly might have been more constructive. By involving the parent, the author bypasses the usual channels of conflict resolution between peers, which could have unintended consequences, like damaging the relationship or causing embarrassment for the friend.\n\nBut given the context of the girlfriend's health struggles, the comment was especially insensitive. The author might have felt that direct confrontation wasn't effective, so they took a different approach. However, the method of involving the parent without explanation might not be the best way to handle it. There's a balance between standing up for someone you care about and respecting the other person's dignity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the line is blurry. The friend's behavior was definitely in the wrong, but the author's actions could be seen as a justified attempt to address the issue, albeit in a way that might not be the most ethical. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action was intended to prevent further harm and the friend showed no remorse, maybe it's a gray area. But typically, escalating the issue to a parent without prior communication might be considered a breach of trust, making the author at least partially at fault for not trying alternative solutions first.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they took a private matter to the friend's parent without discussing it directly. However, given the severity of the comment and the girlfriend's health, some might argue it's justified. But the standard answer would be A.\n"
