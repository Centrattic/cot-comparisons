All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sent a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to his mom is in the wrong. The situation involves the friend making a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has health issues.\n\nFirst, the friend's comment was clearly hurtful and inappropriate. The author tried to address it directly but the friend dismissed it. Now, the author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom, which could be seen as a form of retaliation. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's joke was insensitive and crossed a line, especially considering the girlfriend's medical condition. The author has a valid reason to be upset. On the other hand, sending the screenshot to his mom without giving him a chance to apologize might escalate the situation. However, the author mentions that the friend shows no remorse and the group is hesitant to take sides. The author might feel that involving the parents is necessary to hold the friend accountable, especially since they often hide things from him. \n\nBut is the author justified in their actions? Retaliating by exposing someone's words could be seen as a middle school move, but in this case, it's about protecting their girlfriend's well-being and addressing a serious issue. The friend's behavior was toxic, and the author might feel it's necessary to address it in a way that the friend understands. However, there's a line between standing up for someone and taking matters into your own hands. Involving the mother without giving the friend another chance could be harsh, but given the context of the friend's lack of remorse, maybe it's a justified action. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were defending their girlfriend's dignity and responding to a serious insult. The friend's actions were inexcusable, and the author's response, while perhaps extreme, is a reaction to ongoing disrespect. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
