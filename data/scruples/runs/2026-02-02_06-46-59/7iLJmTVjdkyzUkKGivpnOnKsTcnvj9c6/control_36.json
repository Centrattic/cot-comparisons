All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive message to his mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's girlfriend is going through chemo with lupus, causing her to be swollen and bloated. The friend made a cruel comment targeting her weight, which is directly related to her medical condition. The author tried to respond in a group chat, but the friend doubled down with a joke that was clearly hurtful. The author then considered sending a screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of confrontation.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend's comment was not just a joke; it was a personal attack on someone who's already suffering. The author's girlfriend is in a very vulnerable state, so the friend's words are especially harsh. The author tried to address it directly but the friend showed no remorse. The author is frustrated and feeling like they can't escalate in front of other friends who are passive.\n\nIs the author wrong for considering sending the screenshot? Well, the friend's behavior was clearly inappropriate and cruel. The author is trying to hold the friend accountable. However, sending the message to his mom is a form of revenge and could be seen as crossing a line. Even though the friend's comments were wrong, the author's action might be retaliatory rather than constructive. It's a gray area because the friend's actions were inexcusable, but the author's response could have its own negative consequences, like escalating the conflict or damaging the friend's relationship with his mother.\n\nBut the other side is that the author is trying to protect their partner and address the friend's harmful behavior. If the friend isn't showing any remorse, maybe the author feels like they have no other recourse. However, the appropriate response would typically be to confront the friend directly or seek support from mutual friends or authorities, not to retaliate by exposing the friend's private messages to his family. So the author's action is wrong because it's a personal attack and could lead to further conflict without resolving the issue constructively. The correct answer might be A, but I need to be sure.\n"
