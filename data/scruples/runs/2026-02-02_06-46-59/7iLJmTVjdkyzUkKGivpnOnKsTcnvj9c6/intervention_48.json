All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's friend making a cruel joke about his girlfriend's health condition, which is serious because she's undergoing chemo and has health complications. The author then retaliates by sending a screenshot of the friend's offensive message to his mom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful, targeting the author's girlfriend's medical issues. That's a low point for the friend. The author confronts him but doesn't get a satisfactory response. The friend shows no remorse.\n\nNow, the author's response is to send the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether this action is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's initial comment was cruel and inconsiderate. The author's girlfriend is in a vulnerable state, so the joke is not only insensitive but could be seen as bullying. The author's frustration is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, retaliating by involving the friend's mom might be seen as a breach of trust or privacy. The group chat was supposed to be a private space among friends, so exposing the friend's words without his consent could be considered a violation. Also, the author mentions that they and their friends usually hide things from parents, implying that this action is against the norm they've established. \n\nBut then again, the friend's comment was a public humiliation in a group chat, which is already a form of escalation. The author's action is a form of accountability, trying to address the friend's behavior by involving a parent, which might be a way to get him to take responsibility. \n\nHowever, the method of addressing it through a screenshot and sending it to the mom could be problematic. It's possible that the friend's mom would be upset with the son, but also with the author for exposing the private message. The author might be seen as taking justice into their own hands rather than addressing it through direct communication or other means. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the option of bringing up the friend's real dad leaving him, which is a personal and potentially harsh retaliation. Choosing not to go that route and instead send the screenshot might be a more measured response, but it's still a form of airing private matters publicly. \n\nIn terms of morality, while the friend was wrong, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line by violating privacy. However, considering the severity of the original insult, some might argue that the author's action was justified to protect their girlfriend's dignity and hold the friend accountable. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action is considered a breach of privacy, then yes, they might be in the wrong. But if it's seen as a necessary step to address bullying, then maybe not. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between the severity of the original comment and the appropriateness of the response. While the friend's comment was terrible, sending the screenshot to his mom without his consent could be seen as an overreach, even if the intent was good. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they escalated the situation in a way that's not typically socially acceptable, despite the provocation. Alternatively, if the response is viewed as necessary to address the friend's behavior, then the author might not be in the wrong. But given the context of the group chat and usual norms of keeping things private, the author's action is likely crossing a boundary.\n"
