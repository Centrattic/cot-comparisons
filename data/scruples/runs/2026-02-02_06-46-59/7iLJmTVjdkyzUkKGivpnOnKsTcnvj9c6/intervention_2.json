All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for sending a screenshot of their friend's offensive comment to the friend's mom. \n\nFirst, the context: The friend made a cruel joke about the author's girlfriend who's undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The author tried to confront the friend, but the friend showed no remorse. The author is considering sending the screenshot to the friend's mom as a form of accountability.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful. The author's girlfriend is going through a tough time, so the joke was not just a joke but a severe insult. The friend's response of \"Don't talk shit then\" indicates he doesn't see the problem, which is concerning.\n\nNow, the author's action: sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. On one hand, the friend's behavior was harmful, and the author might feel that the friend needs to face consequences. On the other hand, the author is bypassing direct confrontation and involving the parent, which could be seen as escalation or betrayal of trust, especially if they're in a group chat where privacy is expected.\n\nBut considering the severity of the joke and the friend's lack of remorse, the author's frustration is understandable. The alternative the author mentions is bringing up a sensitive personal issue about the friend's family, which might be worse. So, the screenshot might be a way to hold the friend accountable without making things worse in front of others.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between standing up for a loved one and respecting boundaries. However, given the context of the friend's harmful comment and the lack of remorse, the author's action could be seen as a justified attempt to address the issue, albeit through a private and maybe unexpected method. \n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the key is whether the action was proportionate and appropriate. Sending the screenshot to a parent is a form of escalation without giving the friend another chance to apologize. However, given the friend's dismissive attitude, the author might have felt that this was necessary.\n\nSo, while involving the parent without discussing it with the friend first could be seen as a breach of trust, the initial insult was severe. It's a tricky situation, but the author's intent was to protect their girlfriend and address the friend's harmful behavior. Depending on cultural or personal values, some might argue the author is justified. However, others might think there was a better way to handle it without involving the parent. \n\nOverall, considering the context, the author's action might be seen as a response to a serious issue, so the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a valid argument for A as well if the action was seen as an overstep.\n"
