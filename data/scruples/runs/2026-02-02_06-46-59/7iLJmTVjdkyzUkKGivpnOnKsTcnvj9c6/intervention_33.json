All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend, who is undergoing chemo and has serious health issues. The friend's comment was about the girlfriend's weight and then called the author a fatass. The author is considering sending a screenshot of the friend's message to his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The friend's comment was clearly inappropriate and hurtful, especially given the girlfriend's medical condition. The author felt justified in confronting the friend but is now considering escalating by sending the screenshot to the friend's mom.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the proportionality of the response. The friend's joke was cruel and showed a lack of empathy. The author's reaction was to try to address the issue without escalating publicly, but now is considering involving the friend's parent. \n\nIs sending the screenshot a disproportionate response? Well, if the friend had no remorse and the author felt that confronting him directly wasn't effective, then seeking support from the friend's parent might be a way to address the issue. However, this could also be seen as tattling or not giving the friend a chance to apologize properly. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, possibly because sending the screenshot to the mom is a private matter being exposed in a public way. But considering the severity of the comment and the context of the girlfriend's health issues, maybe the author's action is understandable. \n\nBut wait, the author is using a screenshot to involve the friend's parent, which might bypass the friend's accountability. It's a form of punishment without dialogue. However, given that the friend showed no remorse, maybe the author is justified in seeking intervention. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to address the issue with the friend first, perhaps giving him a chance to apologize. Since the friend didn't take it seriously, maybe the next step is necessary. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not handling it in a more constructive way? It's possible that sending the screenshot is a harsh move, especially if the friend's mom wasn't aware. However, the original comment was extremely hurtful. \n\nI think the key is the severity of the initial joke and the lack of remorse. The author's actions might be seen as a justified attempt to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a better way to handle it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have first tried to speak to the friend more seriously or involve other friends. But given that the friend was dismissive, maybe the screenshot was a last resort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the friend's comment was truly inconsiderate and the author's response is to involve the parents, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the initial comment was clearly the friend's fault. The author is trying to address it, so perhaps they are not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No) because the author is trying to hold the friend accountable for a hurtful comment, especially given the girlfriend's health issues. The friend's lack of remorse makes the situation worse, and the author's action is a way to seek support and prevent future harm.\n"
