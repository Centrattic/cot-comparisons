All of a sudden out of nowhere my friend goes, \u201cWhy do you sound like such a bitch?\u201d. I thought he was just messing around and I said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hit up the gym and get your weight up?\u201d Because he\u2019s short and skinny. He responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m gonna fuck your 400 pound fatass girlfriend\u201d. \n\nMy jaw hit the floor, my girlfriend has been going through chemo since December and is currently swollen and bloated because her kidneys aren\u2019t working properly. Her lupus was so bad that she was a day away from dying. (Her swelling made her go from 108-170 btw)\n\nI told him that he went way too far and he just said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk shit then\u201d. He\u2019s obviously has no remorse for what he says and I don\u2019t know what to do or say. \n\nI know it might be a shitty thing to do but I\u2019m not trying to escalate things in front of my other friends, they dont really know what to do and they haven\u2019t taken any side yet. \n\nWe all help this kid hide shit from his parents all the time. I know it might not be the most moral thing to do but he\u2019s making my blood boil and it\u2019s either that or I say something about his real dad leaving him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend making a cruel comment about the author's girlfriend's health condition, and the author considering sending a screenshot of that comment to the friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the friend's comment was inappropriate. The friend made a joke about the author's girlfriend's weight gain due to chemo, which is a sensitive and serious health issue. That's definitely crossing a line. The friend's remark is not just a harmless joke but a personal attack on someone who's vulnerable. So the friend is definitely at fault here.\n\nNow, the author is thinking about sending the screenshot to the friend's mom. The question is whether that action makes the author wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the friend was in the wrong first. The author is trying to hold them accountable by informing the parents, which might be a way to address the issue without direct confrontation. However, there's a nuance here. The author is using the friend's own behavior as leverage, possibly as retaliation. \n\nBut given the context of the girlfriend's health issues, the friend's comment was malicious and hurtful. The author's action could be seen as a form of justice or protection for their partner. However, sending a screenshot to the friend's mom is a form of passive-aggressive retaliation and might not resolve the issue constructively. It could escalate the conflict or damage the friendship. On the other hand, if the friend shows no remorse and continues to behave this way, the author might feel justified in taking such steps to prevent further harm.\n\nBut wait, the author is in a group chat where others are present. The friends aren't taking sides, and the author is considering using this method to address the problem without escalating it further in front of others. Maybe the author is trying to handle it discreetly. However, informing the parents isn't necessarily the right approach either. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was a proportionate response. The initial comment was extremely hurtful, and the author's reaction is driven by a desire to protect their girlfriend and hold the friend accountable. While sending the screenshot to the mom might be seen as crossing a line in terms of respect for privacy and possibly violating the friend's trust, the friend's actions were also disrespectful and harmful. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The friend's comment was clearly wrong, and the author is reacting to protect their partner. However, using the friend's own privacy against them by sharing the screenshot with their mom might not be the most appropriate method. The author could have other avenues to address this, like confronting the friend directly or seeking support from mutual friends. But given the context, the author's intention is to stop the friend from making such comments again, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're responding to a serious and hurtful comment. However, the method they're choosing might not be the best. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether their method is optimal. Since the friend's comment was clearly the first wrong, the author's action, while possibly unwise, is driven by a desire to address a serious issue. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n"
