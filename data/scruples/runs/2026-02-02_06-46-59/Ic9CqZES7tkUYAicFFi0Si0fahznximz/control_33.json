She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves cultural differences and a friend's ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a new relationship with Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author is aware of her racism but finds her otherwise appealing. They're trying to change her behavior, but their black friend is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the friend or the girlfriend. The author is conflicted and doesn't want to make that choice.\n\nNow, the main issue here is the ethical dilemma of whether being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views makes the author complicit or in the wrong. The author is making an effort to address the racism, but it's unclear if those efforts are sufficient. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't directly racist but is in a relationship with someone who is. They're trying to change her, which is a step, but justifying it by cultural context might not excuse the racism. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or not confronting it can be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a new relationship and might be influenced by love and attraction. They're trying to handle the situation by encouraging change rather than immediately ending the relationship. However, the friend's ultimatum adds pressure, and the author is caught between two important relationships. \n\nI should also consider the cultural aspect mentioned. Eastern European countries might have different social norms, but that doesn't validate racism. The author's awareness of their own past with racism shows they understand it's a complex issue, but changing someone's racist views is challenging and may require more than just the author's efforts.\n\nThe key here is whether enabling a racist partner, even unintentionally, is wrong. If the author is aware of the racism and doesn't take stronger action to address it, they could be seen as complicit. However, if they're actively trying to change her views, perhaps that's a positive step, but the effectiveness is questionable. \n\nGiven that the friend is directly affected and the ultimatum is being made, the author's choice to prioritize the relationship despite the racism might be seen as wrong from the friend's perspective. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong in general. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is trying to handle the situation, staying in a relationship with a racist partner could be considered ethically problematic, especially when it causes harm to others. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they are not taking a strong stance against racism, even if they are making efforts. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the efforts are seen as sufficient and the cultural context is taken into account. But I think the consensus here would be that supporting a racist partner is wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
