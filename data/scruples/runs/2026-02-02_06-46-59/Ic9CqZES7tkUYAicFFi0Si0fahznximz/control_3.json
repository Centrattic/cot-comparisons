She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario involves a guy dating a Ukrainian woman named Diana who holds racist views against Black people. He's conflicted because his best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. Racism is a serious issue, so the fact that Diana is racist is a problem. The user is trying to address this by encouraging her to change, but she hasn't. The friend's reaction is strong, but is his ultimatum justified? Bros before hoes is a common phrase, but does it apply here? The user's friend is a minority, and the girlfriend's racism directly affects him. \n\nThe user is caught between his relationship and his friendship. The key points are: the girlfriend's racism, the user's efforts to change her, the friend's ultimatum, and the user's dilemma. The user might be in the wrong if he's prioritizing his girlfriend's harmful views over his friend's well-being. However, he's also trying to address the racism. But if the girlfriend continues to hold racist views and the user's actions are enabling that, he could be complicit. On the other hand, if he's genuinely trying to help her, maybe not. But the fact that he's stuck between the ultimatum suggests he's not fully addressing the issue. The friend's stance is valid because racism affects the community, and supporting a racist partner can be harmful. So the user might be in the wrong by not confronting the racism effectively and choosing to stay with her despite the friend's valid concerns. Answer A.\n"
