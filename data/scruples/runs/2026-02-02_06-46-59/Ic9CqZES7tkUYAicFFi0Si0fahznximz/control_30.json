She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user has been dating Diana, a Ukrainian girl, for a week. He really likes her and she's described as beautiful, smart, funny, etc. But there's a problem: she's racist against Black people. He mentions that in Eastern Europe, this might be more common, and he thinks it's a cultural issue. His dad had similar experiences in Russia. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially in front of friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship. The friend uses \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase because it devalues relationships with partners. The user is trying to calm the friend down and also work on changing Diana's views. The only specific example given is that Diana doesn't like Black people much and wouldn't want to go to Africa, with the friend being Kenyan.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points here. \n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. The fact that racism is more common in their region doesn't excuse it. The user is trying to address it, which is a good step, but the presence of racism is a serious issue. However, the user is not the one being racist; he's the one who is trying to help his partner change.\n\nThe friend is making a problematic ultimatum. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is inherently problematic because it suggests that friendships are more important than relationships with partners, which can perpetuate gender stereotypes. The friend's approach is not constructive and seems to prioritize his own feelings over understanding the complexity of the situation. The user is caught between two people and is trying to navigate both relationships.\n\nNow, is the user in the wrong for dating someone with racist views? Dating someone with problematic views doesn't automatically make you wrong, but it's important to address those issues. The user is aware of the problem and is trying to work on it. However, he's also being pressured to break up by a friend, which complicates things. The user's responsibility here is to continue trying to address the racism in his partner while also maintaining his friendship. \n\nThe user's actions aren't inherently wrong because he's not the one being racist. However, there's a question of whether he's doing enough to support his friend. The friend feels betrayed, but the user is trying to mediate. The key here is whether the user is actively working to combat the racism in his partner. If he's making genuine efforts, then he's not entirely at fault. However, if the racism in his partner is causing harm to others and he's not doing enough, that could be a problem. \n\nBut the user is in the early stages of the relationship (a week) and has been trying to get Diana to change. The friend's ultimatum is harsh and not helpful. The user's position is that he's not betraying anyone by being with Diana, but his friend feels that way. The user is caught in a tough spot where he's trying to do the right thing by addressing the racism while also maintaining his friendship. \n\nIn terms of the user being in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his actions contribute to the problem. Since he's actively trying to get his partner to stop being racist and isn't the one holding those views, it's less about him being wrong and more about the complexities of navigating conflicting relationships. The friend's reaction is part of the problem here because the ultimatum is not a healthy way to handle the situation. The user isn't the one with the racist views, so he's not directly wrong for being with Diana. However, he might be criticized for not doing more, but the scenario isn't clear on how effective his efforts are. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (the user is not in the wrong) because he's not the one with the racist views and is actively trying to address them. The friend's behavior is more problematic, and the user is caught in a difficult situation where he's trying to do the right thing.\n"
