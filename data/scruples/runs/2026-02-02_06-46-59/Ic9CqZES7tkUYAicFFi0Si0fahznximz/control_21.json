She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl who's racist towards Black people, and the author's friend is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is trying to address their girlfriend's racism, which is mentioned as a cultural issue. The girlfriend hasn't done anything extreme beyond expressing dislike and not wanting to go to Africa. The friend is a Black person who's a close friend, and he's feeling betrayed. The author is caught between their relationship and friendship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or enabling racist behavior can be problematic. However, the author is attempting to change their girlfriend's views, which shows effort. But the girlfriend's racism is still present, and the author is in a relationship with her despite this. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author is expected to navigate their own values here. The author might be in the wrong if they're aware of the racism and choose to ignore it, even if they're trying to address it. However, if the racism isn't extreme or harmful beyond words, it's a complex situation. \n\nBut generally, being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, especially when the author is aware and the partner isn't changing, could be seen as the author being complicit. The fact that the girlfriend hasn't taken harmful actions beyond her words might mitigate some of the blame, but the presence of racism is still an issue. The author's friend's reaction is valid, and the author might be prioritizing the relationship over their friend's feelings, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nHowever, the answer isn't black and white. The author is trying to work on the issue, which is positive. But if the girlfriend's racism is a deal-breaker for the author's values, then the author might be in the wrong by staying in the relationship. The key is whether the author is actively perpetuating or ignoring the racism. If the author is trying to change her but hasn't succeeded, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they're okay with her racism, that's different. The user's situation suggests they're trying to address it, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But this is tricky. \n\nIn terms of societal standards, racism is unacceptable, so being with a racist person can reflect on the partner. However, the author isn't a racist themselves; they're in a relationship with someone who is. The answer might depend on whether the author is complicit in the racism by not addressing it enough. Since they are trying, perhaps they're not in the wrong. But if the racism isn't changing, maybe they should end it. The question is whether they are wrong for sticking with the relationship. Since the girlfriend's actions are verbal and not overtly harmful beyond that, and the author is trying to help, maybe the answer is B (No). But if the racism is a deal-breaker for the author, they should consider ending it, but they aren't in the wrong for trying to work on it. Alternatively, if the author knows the racism is harmful and isn't addressing it adequately, they might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B because the author is making efforts and the girlfriend's racism isn't extreme, but it's a close call. However, the fact that the author's friend is upset and the girlfriend's racism is a significant issue might mean the author is in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating the racist girl. If the author is aware and doesn't take a stand, then they might be. Since they are trying to change her, perhaps they're not. The final answer depends on the severity and the author's role in it.\n"
