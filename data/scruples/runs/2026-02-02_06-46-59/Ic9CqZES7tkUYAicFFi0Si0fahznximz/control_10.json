She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The main points here are about racism, personal relationships, and how others perceive the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's racism is an issue. The author mentions she's racist against Black people, which is a serious problem. The fact that she made a comment about not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa shows that her views are harmful. Even if it's a cultural thing in some regions, racism is a personal choice and shouldn't be excused as just cultural norms.\n\nThe author is caught between his girlfriend and a close black friend who's upset. The friend is giving an ultimatum, which is a big deal. The author is trying to navigate this without taking sides, but the friend feels betrayed. The question is whether the author is wrong for staying with his girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic because it validates those beliefs. The author is in a position where he's not just accepting her but dating her, which brings her into his personal circle. His friend's reaction is understandable because it's hurtful to be excluded or belittled because of someone else's racism.\n\nHowever, relationships are complex. The author might be trying to work on changing her views, which is a positive step. But is that enough? People can change, but it's not the responsibility of the non-racist partner to fix the racist one. Also, the author needs to consider his own values. If he truly opposes racism, continuing the relationship might compromise his own values, even if he's trying to help her.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his feelings are valid. Being asked to choose between the relationship and the friendship is a tough spot, but the core issue is the girlfriend's racism affecting their friend's well-being. The author might be in the wrong if he prioritizes the relationship over standing against racism, especially when it's directly hurting someone he cares about.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in a difficult situation, but his decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism might be seen as supporting her harmful views. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
