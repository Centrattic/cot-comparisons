She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is wrong for dating a girl they consider racist. The author mentions their girlfriend, Diana, has racist views against Black people. They live in Europe, so maybe the cultural context is different. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are racism and the ultimatum. Racism is a serious issue, so if someone is dating someone who expresses racist views, that's a problem. The author is trying to address it by asking Diana to change, but maybe it's not enough. The friend feels betrayed, which adds to the conflict.\n\nThe author might argue that they're making an effort, and that cultural differences play a role. However, racism is a choice and a behavior that can be changed. By not confronting it more directly or ending the relationship, the author could be enabling the racism. Also, the ultimatum from the friend complicates things. The author is caught between two people, but prioritizing one over the other might be necessary if one is harmful.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to align with your values. If someone's racism is a deal-breaker, then staying with them despite it could be seen as wrong. The author's friend is valid in feeling hurt, which might mean the author isn't fully considering the impact of their choice. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because supporting a racist partner, even if you're trying to change them, could be harmful. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if cultural factors and efforts to change are considered. But generally, racism is a serious issue, so A is more likely correct.\n"
