She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the author's Ukrainian girlfriend, Diana, who exhibits racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address this by encouraging her to change her behavior, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Dating someone with racist views can be problematic because it can normalize or condone that behavior. The author is aware of the racism but is choosing to stay in the relationship, which might be seen as supporting or excusing her views. However, the author is making an effort to get her to stop being racist, which shows some level of responsibility.\n\nCultural context is mentioned\u2014Eastern European countries may have different social norms, but that doesn't justify racism. The author's friend feels betrayed, which indicates a conflict between personal relationships and social values. The ultimatum \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic phrase because it undermines the importance of standing against racism, suggesting that friendships should take precedence over opposing discrimination, which is a harmful attitude.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are: the existence of racism, the author's awareness and efforts to address it, and the friend's reaction. While the author is trying to change her, the fact that he's choosing to stay with her despite her racist views could be seen as condoning it. However, changing someone's deep-seated beliefs is difficult, and the author is making an effort, which might mitigate some blame. The friend's ultimatum is also a significant point\u2014while the friend has a right to be upset, the phrase used is dehumanizing and the ultimatum is extreme.\n\nIn terms of ethics, supporting a partner with racist views, even while trying to change them, can be seen as complicit. However, the author isn't actively participating in the racism, just allowing it. The answer depends on whether one believes that being in a relationship with a racist person is inherently wrong if you're not endorsing it. The cultural aspect complicates things, but racism is universally condemned. The author's friend is reacting to the perceived betrayal, but the ultimatum is extreme. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there are elements where he could be criticized for not taking a stronger stance. However, since he's actively trying to address the issue, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, by choosing to stay with her, he might be in the wrong. It's a tough call. The options are A or B. Given that the author is aware, is trying to change her, but is still in the relationship, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making an effort. However, some might argue that he's complicit. The friend's reaction is also extreme, which might shift the blame. Overall, I think the answer is A because by choosing to date her despite her racism, he's enabling it, even if he's trying to change her. But others might say he's not in the wrong if he's making an effort. The question is whether being in a relationship with a racist person is wrong, regardless of efforts. The answer could be A or B. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the analysis shows it's nuanced, maybe the answer is A. But I need to decide.\n"
