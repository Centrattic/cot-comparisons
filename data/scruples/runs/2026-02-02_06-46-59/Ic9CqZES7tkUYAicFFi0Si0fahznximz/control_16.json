She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, and she's racist against Black people. The user is trying to make her stop being racist, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main issue: is the author in the wrong for dating someone with racist views? The friend is saying that by dating her, he's betraying him. But the user is trying to change her behavior, which is good. However, just because someone is trying to address the issue doesn't mean they're not complicit in it. \n\nDiana's racism is a problem. The user mentions that she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa. That's pretty direct racism. The user is in a relationship with her, and even if he's trying to change her, he's still in a relationship with someone who holds those views. That could be problematic because supporting someone's racist views, even if you're trying to change them, might not be the right approach. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is understandable. If the user is in a relationship with a racist person, the friend might feel betrayed, especially if the user is defending that person. The friend is giving an ultimatum, which is harsh, but the core issue is about the racism. \n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, being in a relationship with someone who is racist could be seen as condoning that behavior, unless the user is actively working to counter it. But the user is trying to get her to stop being racist. However, if she continues to hold those views, the user might be enabling her by staying in the relationship. \n\nThe user's argument is that it's a cultural thing and changing someone's racism is hard. But that doesn't excuse the behavior. Racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who is racist might not be compatible with standing against racism. The user is caught between two important relationships but is he wrong for choosing his girlfriend over his friend? \n\nMaybe the user isn't directly in the wrong for being in the relationship, but the problem is that he's not distancing himself from her racist views. If he's not willing to leave the relationship despite her not changing, that could be the issue. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the core problem is the girlfriend's racism. So, the user's wrongness lies in continuing the relationship without the person changing their views, which affects his friend. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because by staying with a racist partner, he's not taking a stand against racism, which can be seen as complicit, even if he's trying to change her. The friend's reaction, while harsh, is based on valid concerns about racism.\n"
