She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend, Diana, who holds racist views, particularly against Black people. The author is conflicted because his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user mentions that Diana's racism is part of a cultural issue in Eastern Europe, which might explain her views. However, the author is trying to address her behavior by encouraging her to stop being racist around friends and family. The problem arises when the friend feels betrayed and demands the author to break up with Diana, threatening the friendship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship despite Diana's racism. On one hand, racism is a serious issue and supporting someone who holds such views can be problematic, especially if they make others feel excluded or hurt. The friend's reaction is understandable because he feels disrespected and marginalized. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic way to handle the situation, but his feelings of betrayal are real.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to address Diana's racism and is not condoning it. The author might be in a difficult position, trying to balance personal relationships and cultural context. However, even if cultural factors contribute to her views, that doesn't excuse racism. The author's responsibility is to consider the impact of their choices on others, especially close friends who are directly affected by the girlfriend's words and actions.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is complicit in allowing racism to persist by not taking a stand. If Diana's racism is causing harm to others, especially a close friend, then the author might be in the wrong by not distancing themselves. The author's argument that it's a cultural issue and hard to change doesn't negate the personal responsibility they have towards their friend's experience.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions to address the issue are commendable, continuing the relationship in the face of such a divisive and harmful trait might place them in the wrong. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over the friend's well-being could be seen as supporting the racist behavior indirectly. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
