She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a girlfriend who is racist. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views against Black people. The author is in a conflict between his girlfriend and his black friend, who feels betrayed and is giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author mentions that racism might be cultural in Eastern Europe, but that doesn't excuse it. The key point is whether the author is complicit by dating her despite knowing her views.\n\nThe author is trying to change her views, which is commendable, but maybe not enough. The friend's reaction is strong, feeling betrayed because the author is in a relationship with someone who holds prejudices against his race. The ultimatum adds pressure to the situation, but the question is about the author's actions, not the friend's.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for continuing the relationship? If racism is a deal-breaker for the friend and the author is aware of the harm it causes, then maybe the author is in the wrong. However, the author might believe they can change her, but that's a long process. On the other hand, choosing to stay with a racist partner might be seen as endorsing those views, even if unintentionally.\n\nI should also consider the cultural context. The author mentions that in Europe, it's not as big a problem, but the friend is directly affected. The author's decision to prioritize the relationship over the friend's feelings could be seen as a betrayal. But the author might not see it that way, thinking they are handling it by trying to change the girlfriend.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they are in a relationship with someone who has racist views, which affects their close friend. Even if they're trying to address it, the continued relationship could be seen as supporting those views. However, if they're actively working to change her, it's a nuanced situation. Still, the harm caused to the friend is significant, so the author might be in the wrong.\n"
