She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman named Diana, who he really likes. However, she has racist views against Black people. The author is European, and he mentions that racism in Eastern Europe might be more culturally ingrained. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship. The author doesn't want to make that choice and is seeking advice.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is the girlfriend's racism and how the author is handling it. The author is trying to address it but is facing pressure from his friend. The friend is using the phrase \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic term as it dismisses the value of women and implies that friendships are more important than relationships, which can be sexist. \n\nThe author is caught between two important relationships. The question is whether he's in the wrong for choosing to stay with his girlfriend despite her racism. On one hand, supporting a partner who holds racist views could perpetuate those views and create harm, especially towards Black individuals. The author's friend is a Black person who feels betrayed, so the author's actions might be seen as validating the racism. \n\nOn the other hand, the author claims that racism in her culture is a factor and that changing someone's views is difficult. He's making an effort to address it. However, just because it's hard doesn't mean it's acceptable to stay in a relationship with someone who is racist. Racism is a serious issue that affects others, and by not confronting it or leaving the relationship, the author may be complicit in the problem. \n\nAlso, the friend's ultimatum is harsh and uses a problematic phrase, which complicates things. The author might be trying to find a middle ground, but the reality is that racism shouldn't be tolerated. Even if it's part of the culture, that's an excuse, not a justification. The author's responsibility is to stand against racism, even if it means making difficult choices. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong if he chooses to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism. While he's trying to address it, the fact remains that supporting a racist partner is problematic and harmful. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
