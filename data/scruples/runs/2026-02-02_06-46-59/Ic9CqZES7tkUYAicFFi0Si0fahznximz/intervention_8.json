She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who he really likes, but she's racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to not be racist, especially around his friends and family. His best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with the girl or lose the friend. The author is conflicted and doesn't want to choose, but he's also trying to change her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is aware that his girlfriend is racist. He mentions that it's a cultural issue in Eastern Europe and that he's tried to address it. However, the fact that she's making a Black friend feel betrayed and is giving an ultimatum is a big deal. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. If someone is racist, it can affect not just their own behavior but also the environment around them. The author is in a position where he's choosing to stay in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, even if he's trying to change her. But changing someone's deeply held beliefs isn't always possible, especially cultural attitudes. The fact that his friend is Black and feels betrayed adds another layer. The friend's reaction is understandable because being in a relationship with someone who is racist can feel like a betrayal to marginalized friends.\n\nThe author might argue that he's trying to work on her racism, but the reality is that if she's making his friend feel excluded or uncomfortable, it's a valid reason for the friend to be upset. The author is caught between two important relationships, but the moral weight here might be on the side of his friend, especially since the friend is from the group that's being targeted by the racism.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the only racist thing she did was saying she doesn't like Black people or want to go to Africa. Even if that seems like a minor thing, those statements are still racist and can contribute to a hostile environment. The fact that his friend is Kenyan adds a personal connection here. The friend's hurt feelings are legitimate because hearing someone you care about express dislike towards your race can be really painful.\n\nThe ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but the friend's perspective is that the author is supporting racism by continuing the relationship. The author might not see it as supporting racism if he's trying to change her, but the presence of someone who is openly racist can still be hurtful. The author is choosing to stay in the relationship, which could be seen as condoning her behavior, even if he's trying to address it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's maintaining a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which directly affects his Black friend. While he's trying to change her, the fact remains that her racism is causing pain and the friend feels betrayed. The author's responsibility here might be to prioritize the feelings and well-being of his friend, especially since racism is a serious issue that can't be easily fixed. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
