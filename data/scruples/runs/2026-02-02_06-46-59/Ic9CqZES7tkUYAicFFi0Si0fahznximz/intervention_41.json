She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who is described as racist towards Black people. The author is in Europe, mentions that racism might be more common in Eastern Europe, and that he's trying to get her to stop being racist. However, a close Black friend is upset and has given an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issues here. The main conflict is between the author's relationship with the girlfriend and his friendship. The girlfriend's racism is a significant red flag. Racism is a serious issue that affects others, and supporting someone who holds such views, especially when they express them openly, can be problematic. The author is aware of her racism but chooses to stay in the relationship, which could be seen as condoning or enabling her behavior.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum, while harsh, is a reaction to being racially targeted. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is often criticized for devaluing relationships with marginalized groups, but in this context, the friend is asserting his right not to be associated with racism. The author is caught between two relationships, but the friend is a person of color who is directly impacted by the racism.\n\nThe author claims he's trying to change his girlfriend, but changing someone's racist views is complex and often requires significant effort and willingness from the individual. It's possible that the author is underestimating the depth of the issue or not addressing it adequately. By not ending the relationship despite knowing her views, he might be prioritizing his own happiness over standing against racism.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's actions\u2014disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa\u2014are explicit expressions of racism. The author's friends, including the Black friend, are valid in their discomfort and objection to being associated with someone who holds these views. The ultimatum, while extreme, stems from a place of hurt and a need for respect towards his identity.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by continuing the relationship despite the racism. Supporting a racist partner can perpetuate harmful attitudes, and the author's choice to stay in the relationship might be seen as complicit. The friend's stance, though confrontational, is about respecting his own values and not being complicit in racism. Therefore, the author's decision to prioritize the girlfriend over his friend's well-being could be considered wrong.\n"
