She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl and facing an ultimatum from a friend. \n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend, Diana, is described as racist towards Black people. The author mentions that she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The author is trying to change her views, which he acknowledges is difficult. However, his friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and is giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's ultimatum and the author's stance. The friend is clearly hurt and feels that the author is prioritizing the relationship over their friendship. The author is caught in the middle, trying to balance both. \n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. Racism is a serious issue. The fact that Diana expresses racist views and the author is aware of this yet continues the relationship could be problematic. The author is trying to change her, but that might not be enough if her views are causing harm to others, especially a close friend. \n\nThe friend's reaction, while perhaps harsh with the ultimatum, is a response to being targeted by racism. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic stance because it devalues the Black friend's feelings and implies that the author should prioritize the girlfriend over a friend, which is ethically questionable. \n\nHowever, the author is in a difficult position. He's trying to navigate a personal relationship while addressing a significant issue. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. By continuing the relationship despite knowing her racist views and the impact it's having on his friend, he may be enabling that racism. The friend's ultimatum is a direct consequence of that decision. \n\nIn terms of ethics, supporting someone who holds racist views that hurt others is not acceptable. The author has a responsibility to his friend and to opposing racism. The fact that he's aware of the problem but hasn't ended the relationship suggests he's choosing to overlook the harm, which could place him in the wrong. \n\nSo, while the situation is complex, the author is complicit by staying with someone whose views are causing distress to a close friend. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
