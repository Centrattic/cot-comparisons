She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about dating someone who is racist, and the author is facing pressure from a friend who is black, to either stop dating the girlfriend or lose the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. She has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to get her to not express or act on racism, but it's not working. The friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum. The author is caught between the two.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Racism is a serious issue. The fact that Diana makes racist comments, like not liking Black people or not wanting to go to Africa, is problematic. The author is aware of this and is trying to address it, but maybe not effectively. \n\nThe friend's reaction is strong. He's saying \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase itself, as it prioritizes friendships over relationships in a way that can be disrespectful, especially when the issue is one of values like racism. However, his stance is that the author is betraying him by dating someone racist. \n\nThe author is trying to navigate this. But the key here is whether the author is complicit in racism by staying in the relationship. Even if the racism is cultural, the author's choice to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist views and then not taking a firm stand could be seen as enabling that behavior. The author's friend sees it as a betrayal, which suggests that the author's actions conflict with the friend's values. \n\nThe author's argument is that changing someone's racism is hard, and they're trying to help Diana. But sometimes, standing up against racism means recognizing that you can't ignore it even if you're in a relationship. By not ending the relationship despite knowing the racism, the author might be in the wrong because they're not fully addressing the harm caused. \n\nAlso, the friend is part of the marginalized group affected by the racism, so his reaction is valid. The ultimatum is harsh, but his point is that the author is choosing a racist partner over a friend, which is a significant moral issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be directly racist themselves, just in a relationship with someone who is. But relationships should involve standing up for each other's values, especially when it comes to fundamental human rights and respect for others. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a tough spot, but by continuing the relationship despite the racism, they might be enabling it. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
