She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, Diana, who is described as having racist views against Black people, particularly mentioning she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The author is trying to address this, but a close friend (who is Black) is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered wrong here. The main issue is whether the author is complicit in racism by dating someone who holds racist views. The author does acknowledge the problem and is trying to change Diana's behavior, but it's unclear how effective those efforts are. The friend feels betrayed, which adds a layer of social conflict.\n\nRacism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be problematic. Even if the author isn't personally racist, they might be enabling or tolerating harmful beliefs. The fact that the girlfriend's racism is affecting the author's relationships (the friend's ultimatum) complicates things. The author is caught between two important relationships, which is tough.\n\nHowever, the author is making an effort to address the issue, which is a positive sign. They're not excusing the behavior but are trying to work on it. The question is whether this is enough. The answer depends on whether the author is responsible for their partner's views. Generally, people can't control others' beliefs, but they can choose to associate with people who share their values. If the author values anti-racism, dating someone who holds racist views might be seen as contradictory, even if they're trying to help the person change.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, as it's a binary choice. But the friend's feelings are valid because racism is a significant issue. The author might be in a tough spot where they're not the one being racist but are still part of a dynamic where their partner's views are causing harm. The key is whether the author is actively supporting or perpetuating the racism. If Diana's views are causing the author to be excluded from the friend group, that's a loss, but the author's responsibility is to their own values and the impact of their relationship on others.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they're making efforts to address the issue and aren't the one being racist. However, the situation is complex. The answer hinges on whether the author's choice to remain with the girlfriend despite her racist views is seen as a moral failing. Since the author is trying to fix it and isn't the one with the racist views, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here; supporting someone's change is a process, and if the racism continues to affect others, the author's continued relationship might still be problematic. However, the question is about the author's wrongness, not the girlfriend's. So, the author isn't the one being racist, so they aren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
