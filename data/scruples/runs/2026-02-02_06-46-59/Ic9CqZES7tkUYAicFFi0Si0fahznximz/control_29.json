She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario involves the girlfriend being racist towards Black people, and the author's friend is upset, giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is aware of her views and is trying to change her, but the friend (who is Black) is upset. The friend feels betrayed because the author is dating someone with racist views, and the ultimatum is a serious issue.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting someone's racism is problematic. Even if the author is trying to change the girlfriend, being in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs might be seen as enabling or condoning those views. The friend's reaction is understandable since racism is a serious issue that affects people's lives and dignity.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's a cultural issue and changing someone's views is difficult. However, just because it's challenging doesn't mean it's acceptable to be in a relationship with someone who is racist. The author's responsibility to his friend and to not support harmful beliefs is important here.\n\nThe key points are: the girlfriend's racist actions, the author's attempt to change her, the friend's ultimatum, and the cultural context. The author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as prioritizing the relationship over standing against racism, which is a significant issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not taking a stronger stance against the racism, even if it's hard to change someone's views.\n"
