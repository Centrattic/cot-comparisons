She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana for a week. He really likes her, and she's described as smart, funny, and sweet. But there's an issue: she's a bit racist against Black people. The user is in Europe, which is less of a problem than other places, but he mentions that his dad had similar experiences in Russia with threats against Black people. The user is trying to get her to stop being racist in front of his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black, is upset and gave him an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friend. The user is conflicted and doesn't want to choose, but his friend is being very firm.\n\nFirst, I should consider the moral implications here. Is it okay to date someone who is racist? The user isn't saying she's a casual racist; he's trying to help her change. But he's also in a situation where his best friend is Black and feels betrayed. The friend's reaction is strong, but is that justified? The user isn't the racist one here; he's the one trying to address the issue. However, he is choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. \n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. If he values his friendship with the Black friend, and the friend feels that the user isn't standing against racism by dating someone who is racist, then the user might be seen as complicit by association. But the user is actively trying to help Diana change. However, supporting someone who holds harmful beliefs can still be problematic, even if you're trying to change them. \n\nThe user's stance is that it's a cultural issue and that changing someone's racism is a long process. But justifying racism as cultural doesn't make it right. The fact that Diana says she \"doesn't like Black people that much\" and wouldn't want to go to Africa (Kenya) shows her prejudice. The user's friend, who is directly affected, feels betrayed, which adds weight to the friend's perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is in a new relationship and hasn't given up on changing her. Relationships can involve personal growth, but racism is a serious issue. If the user continues to support her without her making efforts to change, he might be enabling her behavior. However, the user is making efforts to address it. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It's a tough call. If he's not engaging in racist behavior himself but is in a relationship with someone who does, it's a matter of perspective. Some might argue that he's not directly responsible, others might say that by being in the relationship, he's complicit. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the user's choice to stay with Diana when it's causing harm to his friend's feelings is problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the user might not be in the wrong in the sense that he's trying to help his girlfriend, but he's also not addressing the fact that his actions (staying with her) might be harmful. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's racism, not the user's direct actions. So, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but there's a nuanced aspect here. Alternatively, some might see him as enabling the racism, making him complicit. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his girlfriend is. Since he's trying to change her, maybe he's not directly wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
