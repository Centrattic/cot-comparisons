She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about dating a girl who's racist, specifically against Black people, and his friend is upset and giving him an ultimatum between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl's racism is a problem. The user is trying to change her, but the friend is taking a hard stance. The user doesn't want to choose, but the friend insists. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for staying with the girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, supporting someone's racism is a problem. Even if it's cultural, it's still harmful. The user's friend is pointing out that dating someone with such views could be seen as condoning it. The user is trying to address it, but the friend feels betrayed. \n\nBut does that mean the user is in the wrong? Well, the user isn't the one being racist, but he's in a relationship with someone who is. The user's actions might be seen as supporting or at least not actively opposing the racism. If the user isn't doing anything to actively challenge her views beyond trying to get her to stop, maybe he's complicit. \n\nOn the other hand, changing someone's deeply held beliefs, especially if it's cultural, is hard. The user is trying, which shows he's aware of the issue. But the friend's reaction is also extreme with the ultimatum. However, the initial question is about whether the user is in the wrong, not the friend.\n\nThe user's main action is continuing the relationship. If the girlfriend's racism is ongoing and he's not taking stronger steps to address it, maybe that's the problem. But if he's making an effort, perhaps he's not entirely at fault. However, in terms of moral responsibility, being in a relationship with someone racist can be seen as problematic, especially if you're aware of the harm her views cause.\n\nAnother angle: the user's friend is part of the group affected (being Black). The friend is hurt and feels betrayed because the user isn't distancing from someone who discriminates against him. So, the user's choice to stay with the girlfriend might be seen as prioritizing the relationship over a friend's well-being. That could be considered wrong.\n\nBut it's a personal choice. The user has to decide his own values. However, from a societal perspective, supporting racism is wrong. The user is enabling the girlfriend's behavior by staying with her. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because he's not taking a firm stance against racism, despite trying to change her. But if he's actively working on it, maybe B (not in the wrong). It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key is that even if you're trying to change someone, being in a relationship with a racist person can be seen as complicit, especially if the racism is directed at people you care about. The user's friend is directly affected, and the user is making a choice that causes harm to their friendship. So the user might be in the wrong because he's not taking a firm stand against racism, even if unintentionally.\n"
