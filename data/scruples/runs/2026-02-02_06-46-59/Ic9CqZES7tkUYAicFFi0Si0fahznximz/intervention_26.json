She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who he really likes, but she has racist views against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose his friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs. He's aware of her racism, is trying to change her behavior, but his friend is pushing him to choose between the relationship and the friendship. The question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be problematic, especially if they don't acknowledge or address their biases. The author mentions that it's a cultural thing in Eastern Europe, but that doesn't excuse racism. Just because something is culturally prevalent doesn't make it acceptable. The author is trying to change her views, which is commendable, but changing someone's deep-seated beliefs is tough and might not be feasible. \n\nThe friend who is Black is hurt and feels betrayed because the author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views against his community. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but his feelings are valid. The author is caught in a tough spot, but the core issue is whether he's wrong for being with a racist partner.\n\nIf the author values his friend's feelings and the friend's well-being, he might need to reconsider staying in the relationship. However, if he's not willing to let go of the relationship despite knowing the harm his partner's racism can cause, then he might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if he's actively trying to address the issue and the friend is being unreasonable, the situation is more complex.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is complicit in enabling racism by staying with someone who is racist. Even if he's trying to change her, his continued presence in the relationship might not be helping the situation. Also, the friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author should consider whose actions are causing direct harm. The girlfriend's racism is a problem, and the author's choice to stay with her might be seen as supporting her views, which is wrong regardless of the cultural context.\n\nSo, in conclusion, even though the author is trying to do the right thing by addressing the racism, he is still in a relationship with someone who is racist, which can be harmful. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
