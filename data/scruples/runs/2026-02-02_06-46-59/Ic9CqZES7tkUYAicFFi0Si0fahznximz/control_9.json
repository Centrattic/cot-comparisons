She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. Let me start by understanding the situation. The user is in a new relationship with Diana, a Ukrainian woman he really likes. He mentions that she's racist against Black people, which is causing a problem with his friends, especially one who is Black and a close friend for three years. The friend is giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The user is trying to address the issue by getting Diana to stop being racist but feels pressured to make a choice.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main issues here. Dating someone with racist views and the conflict with a close friend. The user's stance is that it's a cultural thing and that changing someone's racism is a long process. He's trying to work on it. But his friend feels betrayed and is using the \"bros before hoes\" argument, which is a problematic phrase itself, as it devalues relationships and people. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the user's choice to continue the relationship might be problematic if the racism is a significant factor.\n\nI need to evaluate where the responsibility lies. The user is aware of his girlfriend's racism and is making an effort to address it, which is commendable. However, the girlfriend's actions include making statements about not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. These are clear expressions of racism, even if they stem from cultural norms. The user is in a position where he's supporting a person who has these views, which could be hurtful to others, including his friend.\n\nThe question is whether the user is wrong for choosing to stay with his girlfriend despite her racism. In relationships, it's important for both people to respect each other's values and to address harmful behaviors. If the user is aware of her racism and it's causing conflict with his friends, especially those directly affected, then there might be an ethical consideration in continuing the relationship if he cannot change her views or if she's not open to change. On the other hand, if he's genuinely trying to help her become more accepting and she's making an effort, then maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nBut the key point here is that the user is being asked if he's in the wrong by his friend. The friend's reaction is an ultimatum, which is a harsh response, but the underlying issue is the girlfriend's racism. The user's decision to stay with her could be seen as problematic if he's complicit in her racist attitudes by not confronting them effectively. However, the user is also trying to help her change, which shows he's not ignoring the issue. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the Black friend. The friend is directly affected by the girlfriend's comments and is feeling hurt and disrespected. The user's choice to prioritize the relationship over the friendship might be seen as unfair to the friend, especially if the girlfriend's racism is a deal-breaker in the user's own eyes. But since the user hasn't actually made the choice yet and is seeking advice, it's unclear if he's continuing the relationship despite knowing the harm.\n\nThe phrase \"bros before hoes\" is itself a harmful stereotype that prioritizes male friendships over women, which is toxic. The friend's ultimatum might be coming from a place of defensiveness, but the user should also consider that racism is a serious issue. If the user truly values his Black friend's feelings and the importance of not endorsing racism, he might need to reflect on whether he can be in a relationship with someone who holds such views, even if he's trying to change them. \n\nIn conclusion, while the user is making an effort to address the racism, he might still be in the wrong if he chooses to stay with the girlfriend who is actively expressing racist sentiments, especially when it's causing a rift with a close friend who is a victim of that racism. The responsibility isn't just on the friend to accept the situation but also on the user to ensure his partner respects others. So, the answer is probably A (Yes), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing.\n"
