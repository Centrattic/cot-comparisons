She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who makes racist comments towards Black people. The author is trying to change her behavior but faces pressure from a friend who is Black and demands an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views, even if it's culturally influenced, can be problematic. The author is aware of the racism but continues the relationship, which might imply complicity. However, the author is also trying to address the issue by encouraging Diana to change, which shows some effort towards resolution.\n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a controversial phrase that devalues the importance of a romantic relationship. This ultimatum might not be fair, as it forces a choice without considering the complexity of the situation. The author is caught between maintaining the relationship and preserving the friendship.\n\nNow, evaluating the author's actions: they are not the one making racist remarks, but they are in a relationship with someone who does. The question is whether the author is at fault for not ending the relationship despite knowing about the racism. On one hand, staying with someone who is racist could support their behavior. On the other hand, the author is making efforts to address it, indicating they care about the issue.\n\nConsidering the broader context, it's important to recognize that racism is harmful and should not be tolerated. While cultural background might explain some attitudes, it doesn't justify them. The author's decision to continue the relationship might be seen as condoning the behavior, especially when a close friend is directly affected by it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult position, but since they are aware of the racism and the friend's hurt feelings, continuing the relationship could be considered supporting a harmful worldview. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not taking a stronger stance against the racism, even if they are trying to change her. The answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
