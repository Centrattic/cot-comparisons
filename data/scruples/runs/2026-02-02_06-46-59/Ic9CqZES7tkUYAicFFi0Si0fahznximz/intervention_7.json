She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for dating a girl who's racist. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, Diana, who is described as having racist views, particularly against Black people. The author is trying to change her views and is caught between his girlfriend and his best friend, who is Black and is upset about the relationship. The friend gives an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a red flag. While the author thinks it's a cultural issue common in Eastern Europe and is trying to work on it, racism is a serious issue that affects others. The friend's reaction is understandable given that the girlfriend's comments are directed at his identity as a Black person. The author is trying to navigate this by attempting to change her views, but the friend feels betrayed, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are:\n\n1. **Racism as a personal issue**: The girlfriend's racism is a significant problem. It's not just about personal beliefs but also about how those beliefs affect others, especially when they're expressed publicly or directed at friends and family. The author might be in denial about the severity of the issue, thinking it's a cultural thing that can be \"cured,\" but racism is a harmful ideology that shouldn't be tolerated in relationships that affect others.\n\n2. **Friendship vs. Relationship**: The friend's ultimatum (\"bros before hoes\") is a classic but problematic way of handling such a situation. However, the fact that the friend is directly targeted by the girlfriend's racism makes his stance more justifiable. The author is placing his partner's comfort over his friend's well-being, which is a conflict of values. The friend is being asked to accept someone who openly expresses prejudice against him, which is hurtful and disrespectful.\n\n3. **Author's Responsibility**: The author is aware of the issue and is trying to change the girlfriend's views, but his actions (continuing the relationship) might be seen as endorsing or tolerating racism. Even if he's not racist himself, being in a relationship with someone who is and not taking a firm stance can be problematic, especially when it harms others. The author might not be the one being racist, but he's in a position where he's enabling or at least not challenging harmful behavior.\n\n4. **Cultural Context**: The author mentions it's common in Eastern Europe. However, while cultural norms can influence behavior, they don't excuse racism. It's important to distinguish between cultural practices and systemic or personal prejudice. The girlfriend's specific comments about not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa are explicit racist statements, regardless of cultural context.\n\n5. **Ultimatum and Consequences**: The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author is caught in a difficult position. However, the author might be prioritizing his romantic relationship over his long-term friendship, which could indicate where his loyalties lie. This doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong, but it does highlight the conflict between personal happiness and ethical considerations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot, but his decision to continue the relationship despite the girlfriend's racism, especially when it affects a close friend, could be seen as morally questionable. While he's not the one expressing racism, by choosing to stay with her, he might be complicit in perpetuating a harmful environment for his friend. The answer would likely be that he is in the wrong (A) because he's not holding his partner accountable for her prejudice, which directly impacts others. However, some might argue he's not in the wrong if he's genuinely trying to change her views. But given the friend's direct experience and the ultimatum, the ethical choice would be to support the friend, making the author's stance problematic.\n"
