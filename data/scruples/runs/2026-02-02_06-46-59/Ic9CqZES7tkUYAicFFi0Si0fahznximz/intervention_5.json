She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who he says is racist against Black people. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is defending his girlfriend's racism as cultural, maybe from Eastern Europe. He's trying to change her, but she still makes racist comments. His friend is cutting him off unless he breaks up with her. The author is conflicted and doesn't want to make a choice between the two.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Racism is a serious issue. If someone is racist, supporting them instead of challenging the behavior can be problematic. The author seems to know it's wrong but is staying with her despite her racist remarks. He's trying to make her change but hasn't succeeded. His friend is standing up for himself, which is understandable. The author might be enabling the racism by not taking a firm stance. Also, the girlfriend's actions are offensive to his Black friend, which causes a conflict. \n\nBut some might argue that the author is trying to help her change, and racism can be complex. However, the friend is being hurt and is given an ultimatum, which is extreme, but the author is choosing not to take a stand. In relationships, it's important to support each other's values. If the author truly opposes racism, he might need to confront it more directly. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's aware of her racism and doesn't act to stop it, maybe he is. By staying with her despite her racist views, he's not holding her accountable, which could be seen as complicity. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But wait, the user thinks he's in the wrong too. The friend is right to be upset, and the author should address his girlfriend's racism more effectively. He's choosing to ignore or downplay it, leading to the friend's ultimatum. That seems like being in the wrong.\n"
