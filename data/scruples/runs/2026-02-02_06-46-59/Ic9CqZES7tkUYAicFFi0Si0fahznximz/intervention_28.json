She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe person is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana. They really like her, but she's racist against Black people. The author mentions that in Eastern Europe, this might be a cultural thing. They've tried to get her to stop being racist, especially around friends and family. One of their friends, a Black Kenyan guy, is upset that they're dating Diana and is giving them an ultimatum: choose between the friend or the girlfriend. The author is conflicted, trying to calm the friend down while also working on Diana's racism. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The girlfriend is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to address it, but the friend feels betrayed and is demanding a choice. The author doesn't want to make that choice but is being pressured. \n\nNow, the author's responsibility here. If the girlfriend is being racist, especially towards a close friend who is Black, and the author is aware of this, they have a duty to address it. However, changing someone's racist views is difficult and takes time. The author is attempting to work on this with Diana, which is commendable. But the friend feels that by supporting the girlfriend, the author is betraying them. \n\nThe ultimatum from the friend complicates things. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it's dismissive of the girlfriend's worth and perpetuates negative stereotypes about women. The friend's approach is harsh, but the core issue is whether the author is enabling racism by staying with Diana.\n\nRacism is a serious matter. If the author is aware that their partner is racist and the partner is unwilling to change, then continuing the relationship could be seen as complicit in her racism, especially if the author's close friend is being directly targeted. The fact that the friend is Kenyan and the girlfriend's dislike of Black people and Africa is a direct issue here. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to change her views, which shows they care about the problem. But if the girlfriend isn't making progress or is resistant to change, the author might still be in a position where they're supporting someone with harmful views. \n\nThe author's stance is that it's a cultural issue and changing racism is hard. But racism isn't just a personal issue; it's a systemic problem that affects others. By being in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs and not addressing it effectively could be seen as endorsing those views, especially if the partner is unwilling to engage in self-reflection or change.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite the friend's racism might be seen as prioritizing their relationship over supporting their friend. That could be a betrayal, especially if the friend is directly harmed by the girlfriend's racism. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if they are knowingly in a relationship with someone racist and are not effectively challenging those views, they might be enabling the behavior. However, the author is making an effort, which is a mitigating factor. But the friend's reaction is also valid because experiencing racism is harmful, and standing by a partner who is racist can be hurtful to friends who are targeted.\n\nSo, the balance here is between the author's personal relationship and their responsibility to their friend's well-being. If the author can't reconcile the girlfriend's racism with supporting their friend, then they might be in the wrong for not taking a firmer stance against the racism. However, if they are actively working on the issue with the girlfriend, there's some leniency. But given that the friend is directly affected and the ultimatum is presented, the author's continued support of the girlfriend might be seen as harmful.\n\nI think the key is whether the author is actively complicit. If they are making efforts but the girlfriend isn't changing, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, if the author is aware of the racism and it's causing direct harm to their friend, then choosing to stay in the relationship could be seen as in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because supporting a partner with racist views despite the negative impact on a close friend is problematic. Alternatively, if the author is making genuine efforts, maybe B (Not in the wrong). \n\nBut considering that the friend is directly targeted and the author isn't resolving the issue effectively, the answer leans towards A. The author's decision to prioritize the girlfriend over the friend's well-being, especially given the harmful nature of racism, could be considered wrong.\n"
