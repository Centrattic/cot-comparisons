She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The question is whether the author is at fault here. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is dating Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address her racism, but it's not working, and a friend (who is Black) is upset and giving an ultimatum. The author is caught between his girlfriend and his friend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, dating someone with racist views isn't automatically wrong, but it's important to consider the impact. The author is aware of Diana's racism and is trying to make her change, but if she's not willing to address it, that's a problem. The friend feels betrayed because the author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs, which directly affects the friend.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is making an effort to address the racism, but the girlfriend isn't changing. The friend is upset because of the direct harm to him. The author is being asked to choose between the relationship and the friendship. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author might not be the one being racist, but by continuing the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend's views and the friend's concerns, he could be seen as complicit or enabling the racism. However, the author is making an effort to change her views, which shows he's not okay with it. \n\nIt's a bit tricky. On one hand, the author isn't the racist person. On the other hand, by staying with someone who is racist, especially when it directly affects a close friend, he might be contributing to a harmful environment. The friend has a right to be upset if the author isn't taking the racism seriously enough. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for dating her initially, but if he's aware of her racism and it's causing harm to others (like his friend), then he might be at fault for not taking stronger action. The answer would depend on whether the author's inaction in the face of racism is considered wrong. \n\nGiven that the author is trying to help her change but hasn't succeeded, and the friend is now making an ultimatum, the author is in a tough spot. However, the friend's stance is also problematic because \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic phrase that dismisses the importance of the relationship. But the core issue is the racism. \n\nSince the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the author is making an effort, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance. If the author is aware of the racism and continues the relationship without taking adequate steps to address it, that could be seen as wrong. However, the user says they're trying to change her, so maybe it's not their fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), but with the understanding that the author needs to make a choice that respects both his friend's feelings and his relationship, possibly by ending the relationship if the racism can't be addressed. But technically, the author isn't the one being racist, so he's not directly at fault. The real issue is the girlfriend's racism. However, the friend's reaction and the ultimatum complicate things. The user is being asked if they're in the wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism. Depending on the context, some might say yes, but others might say no. The answer might be B, but the situation is complex.\n"
