She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. Let's see. The situation is that they're dating Diana, who's Ukrainian and has racist views against Black people. The author mentions that in Eastern Europe, maybe it's more common, but he's trying to get her to stop being racist. His black friend is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friend.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. He really likes Diana and is happy with her. He's trying to change her views, which is a long process. He doesn't want to pick between his friend and Diana. But his friend feels betrayed. The question is whether the author is wrong for staying with Diana despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a big issue. Even if it's cultural or a personal flaw, supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author isn't excusing her racism but is in a tough spot. However, just because someone is trying to change someone else's behavior doesn't mean they're not complicit in it. By staying with her, he might be enabling her racism or not addressing it adequately. The friend is right to be upset because racism is harmful, and dating someone who holds such views could be seen as endorsing them, even if the person is trying to help.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't the one being racist. He's the one trying to change her. The question is whether he's in the wrong for choosing to stay with her. If he's aware of her racism and hasn't taken sufficient steps to address it, maybe he's complicit. But if he's actively trying to change her mind, perhaps it's not his fault. However, the fact that she's making racist comments and he's not confronting her more directly could mean he's not doing enough. Also, the friend's ultimatum is harsh, but racism is a serious issue that should be taken seriously.\n\nSo, on one hand, the author is trying to help, but on the other, he's in a relationship with someone who's racist. The line between supporting someone's change and enabling harmful behavior is thin. If the author isn't taking concrete steps to address the racism, like having tough conversations, setting boundaries, or considering ending the relationship if she doesn't change, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's doing all that and it's a work in progress, maybe not. The key is whether he's actively working to counter her racism or just tolerating it.\n"
