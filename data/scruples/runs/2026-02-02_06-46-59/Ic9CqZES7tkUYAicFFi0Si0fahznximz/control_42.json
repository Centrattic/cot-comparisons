She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. \n\nFirst, the guy is dating Diana, who he really likes. She's described as beautiful, smart, funny, etc., but she has racist views against Black people. He's from Europe, and he mentions that in Eastern Europe, there's a cultural context where racism might be more prevalent. His dad had similar experiences in Russia, so he's attributing her racism to cultural factors.\n\nHe's trying to get her to stop being racist around his friends and family, especially since one of his close friends is Black. The friend is upset, giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The guy is conflicted because he likes Diana a lot and is trying to work on her racism, but his friend isn't giving him time and is pushing for a decision.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about supporting and challenging racism in relationships. If someone is in a relationship with a partner who holds racist views, there's a responsibility to address those issues. However, changing someone's racist attitudes is complex and not straightforward. The author is making an effort to help Diana, but maybe not enough. \n\nRacism is a serious issue that affects others deeply. The Black friend feels betrayed, which is significant. The author might be enabling racism by staying with Diana despite her views, especially if she's unwilling to change. The ultimatum from the friend is extreme, but the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over his friend's feelings could be seen as problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to work on the issue, which is a positive step. But if Diana's racism is a deal-breaker for his friend and others, the author might need to reconsider the relationship. Supporting a partner's harmful behaviors can be as damaging as the behaviors themselves. \n\nSo, the author's responsibility is to address racism in the relationship. If Diana is resistant to change, continuing the relationship might perpetuate harm. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not taking a firm stand against racism, even if he's trying to help. The cultural context doesn't excuse the racism, and the friend's reaction, while heavy-handed, is a valid expression of hurt feelings.\n"
