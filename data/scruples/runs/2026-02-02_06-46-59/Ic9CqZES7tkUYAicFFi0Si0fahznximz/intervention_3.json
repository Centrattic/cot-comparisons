She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people, and the author is trying to convince her to stop being racist. His black best friend is upset and gave an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about racism and the choices made. Dating someone who holds racist views can be a complex issue. The author is trying to change her views, but that's a tough task. However, the girl is making racist statements, which can be harmful. The author's friend is taking a firm stance, leading to a conflict.\n\nRacism is a serious issue that affects people's lives and perpetuates discrimination. If the girlfriend is openly racist, even if it's culturally ingrained, it's still harmful. The author is caught between his relationship and his friendship. The friend feels betrayed because the girlfriend's racism is directed at a part of his identity. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is dismissive of the seriousness of racism, but the friend's stance might be justified given the harm caused by racism.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he's choosing to stay in a relationship where his partner holds racist views that he knows are harmful. Even if he's trying to change her, if she's not willing or open to change, continuing the relationship could support or normalize those views. On the other hand, the author could argue that he's trying to address the issue and that cultural factors play a role. But racism is a personal choice, not just a cultural one. The fact that the girlfriend makes explicit racist statements (like not liking Black people or Africa) is problematic.\n\nThe author's responsibility includes not supporting or enabling harmful behavior. If the girlfriend is unwilling to change, the author might be complicit by staying with her. The friend's reaction is understandable because his experience and identity are being targeted. The author's choice between the two might not be easy, but staying with a racist partner when he knows the harm it causes could be seen as being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's choosing to stay in a relationship with someone who is racist, despite knowing the negative impact it has on others. It's important to stand against racism, and supporting a partner who is racist can perpetuate those harmful attitudes.\n"
