She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is dating Diana, who is Ukrainian and has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to change her behavior, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum. The author is conflicted between his girlfriend and friend.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girl's racism is a problem. The author is aware of her racist views and is trying to address them, but the friend is upset. The friend's reaction is an ultimatum, which the author finds unfair. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if the author is trying to help her change, the fact remains that the girlfriend holds racist beliefs. The author is in a relationship with someone who discriminates against others, which can affect others around them. The friend, being directly targeted by the racism, has valid reasons to be upset.\n\nThe author's justification is that it's a cultural thing in Eastern Europe. While cultural context might explain some attitudes, it doesn't excuse racism. The author's responsibility is to stand against racism, not enable it by staying in a relationship where the partner expresses such views, even if it's considered normal in their culture.\n\nThe author is being asked to choose between the girlfriend and the friend. The friend's stance is that the author is betraying him by dating someone racist. The author's response is to try to mediate, but the friend isn't budging. Here, the author is in a tough spot, but the core issue is whether supporting a racist partner is acceptable.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to align on core values. If the author values anti-racism, they might need to reconsider staying with someone who is racist. However, if the author is trying to change her views, that's a different angle. But the effectiveness of changing someone's views, especially on something as deep as racism, is questionable. It's a long process, and the author might be underestimating how entrenched her views are.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is harsh with the ultimatum, but it's a direct response to being targeted. The author might be in a position where they can't have both if the girlfriend doesn't change her behavior. The author's stance here could be seen as prioritizing the relationship over the friend's well-being, which could be perceived as wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author continues the relationship without addressing the racism effectively, they might be complicit in upholding racist views. However, if they're genuinely trying to change her, then maybe not. But given that racism is a serious issue, and the friend is being directly affected, the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism might be seen as the wrong decision. Hence, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
