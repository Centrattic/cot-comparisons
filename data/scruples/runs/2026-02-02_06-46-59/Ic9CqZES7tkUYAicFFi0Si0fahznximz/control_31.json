She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend and not being able to choose between her and a friend who is upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He really likes her and is happy, but she's racist against Black people. He's in Europe, so maybe the cultural context is different, but his dad's stories from Russia suggest that racism there might be more prevalent. The author is trying to help Diana not be racist, but his best friend (who is Kenyan) is upset and given an ultimatum: the author has to choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The friend used the phrase \"bros before hoes,\" which is a bit of an issue because that phrase itself is problematic and dismissive of non-white people.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is aware of her racist views and is trying to change her, but maybe he's not doing enough. The friend is upset because he feels betrayed and is making the author choose. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the issue is the author's decision to continue dating someone who is racist and not making enough progress in addressing it.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's a cultural thing, allowing it to persist in a relationship can be harmful. The author might be enabling the girlfriend's racism by staying with her instead of addressing it more directly. The fact that the girlfriend has said she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa shows that her views are not just cultural but personal and offensive. The author's friend is standing up against racism, which is commendable, and the ultimatum, while harsh, is a reaction to the author not taking the racism seriously enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to work on the issue, which is a good step. But maybe he's not doing enough. The problem is that he's putting pressure on his friend to accept a racist partner, which could be seen as dismissing his friend's experience. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a red flag because it devalues people of color, implying that friendships with white people are more important than relationships with non-white partners. The friend's stance, while extreme, is about standing up for his values against racism.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not addressing the racism effectively and is prioritizing his new relationship over his friend's well-being. However, the friend's approach is also problematic. But the question is about the author. His inaction in confronting the racism and the friend's valid concerns might place the blame on him.\n"
