She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is in a one-week relationship with a Ukrainian girl who expresses racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address this by encouraging her to stop being racist, but a friend is upset and giving an ultimatum to choose between the friend and the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a significant issue. The author is aware of her views and is making an effort to change her behavior, but the friend is not happy and is threatening to end the friendship. The author is caught between two important relationships.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Is it acceptable to date someone who is racist? Generally, supporting or being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic because it may contribute to perpetuating harmful attitudes. However, the author is trying to address the issue, which shows some level of concern. \n\nThe girlfriend's racism might be influenced by cultural factors from Eastern Europe, but that doesn't justify her views. The author is navigating a complex situation where personal happiness is at stake, but so is the friendship with a close friend who is Black. The friend feels betrayed, which adds another layer of ethical consideration.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is to consider the impact of their relationship on others. If the girlfriend's racism is expressed in ways that affect others (like in front of friends or family), the author might be complicit by not taking stronger action. However, the author is still trying to work on the issue, which could be a mitigating factor.\n\nIn terms of the ultimatum from the friend, the phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a traditional expression that prioritizes male friendship over romantic relationships. While this might seem dismissive of relationships, the friend's stance is based on the harm caused by the author's choice to date someone with racist views. The friend's perspective is that supporting racism is a betrayal, which is a valid concern given the harm it can cause to the Black community.\n\nThe author's dilemma is whether to stay with the girlfriend and risk losing a close friend. The ethical question here is about where the author's responsibility lies. They have a duty to not support or enable racist behavior, but they also want to maintain their relationship. However, if the girlfriend's racism is a fundamental part of her character and the author is aware of it, continuing the relationship might be seen as endorsing her views, at least implicitly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in the early stages of the relationship and is making an effort to address the issue. They might not have known the extent of her racism initially and are now trying to resolve it. The cultural context is also a factor, but that shouldn't be an excuse for racism.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on their actions. If they continue to support someone with racist views despite knowing the harm it causes, they might be complicit. However, if they are actively working to change her behavior, there's a case for not being in the wrong. But given that the friend is directly affected and the racism is a serious issue, the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over the friendship might be seen as wrong. However, the friend's ultimatum is also problematic because it's an extreme measure. The author is caught in a tough spot, but the core issue is the girlfriend's racism and the author's responsibility towards it. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are choosing to stay with someone whose racism negatively impacts others.\n"
