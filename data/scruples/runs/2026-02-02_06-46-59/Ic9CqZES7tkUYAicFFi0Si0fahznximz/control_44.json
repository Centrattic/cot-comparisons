She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who is racist against Black people. The author likes her a lot but is facing backlash from a friend who is Black and is making an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: is racism present in the girlfriend? The user mentions that she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa. That's a clear statement of racism. The author is trying to change her behavior, which is commendable, but the friend is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nNow, the author is caught between two important relationships. The question is whether the author is wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism. From a moral standpoint, supporting racism is wrong. However, the author might believe that they can change her views. But is that the right approach?\n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, but ultimatums can be problematic. The friend might feel betrayed because the author is choosing someone who holds racist views, which can affect the friend's well-being and sense of respect. The author might not see the racism as a deal-breaker, thinking it's a cultural issue. However, racism isn't just cultural; it's a harmful belief that affects people's lives. The author needs to consider whether staying in the relationship supports or condones racism, even if the girl is otherwise kind.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to address the issue, but if the girlfriend isn't willing to change, then the relationship could perpetuate harmful attitudes. The key question is whether the author is complicit in her racism by staying with her. If the author is aware of the racism and doesn't take a stand, they might be enabling it. The fact that the friend is Black and feels betrayed adds another layer, as the author's choice directly affects their friend's comfort and trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author values their friendship and the friend's well-being, choosing the girlfriend who is racist could be seen as wrong. However, if the author believes they can change the girlfriend's views, it's a different perspective. But realistically, changing someone's deep-seated racism is difficult, and the author might be putting their friend through continued discomfort. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not taking a stronger stance against racism, even if they care about the girlfriend.\n"
