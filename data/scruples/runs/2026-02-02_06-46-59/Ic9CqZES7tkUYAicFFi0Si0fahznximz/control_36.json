She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is a Ukrainian woman with racial prejudices against Black people, specifically mentioning she doesn't like them and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The author is in Europe, and his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of dating someone with racist views. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or being associated with it can be harmful. The author is trying to address his girlfriend's racism, which is commendable, but he's facing a conflict between his relationship and his friendship. \n\nThe friend's reaction, while extreme, is a valid expression of how racism affects others. The author's girlfriend's statements, even if she doesn't act on them, can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The question is whether the author is at fault for being in a relationship with her despite this. \n\nThe author might argue that he's trying to change her views, but that's a long process. However, choosing to stay with someone who holds racist beliefs, even if they don't act on them publicly, can still support those views. The friend sees this as a betrayal, which the author disagrees with. The dilemma here is about balancing personal relationships against moral obligations. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, complicity in racism is a concern. Even if the author isn't racist, being in a relationship with someone who is can imply support. The key point is whether the author is actively working to counter her racism or if staying with her despite it makes him complicit. \n\nSince the girlfriend hasn't acted on her racism in front of friends or family, but her beliefs are still harmful, the author's decision to stay may not be inherently wrong. However, he has a responsibility to address her racism. The friend's ultimatum complicates things, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing his partner over his friend, especially if he's taking steps to address the issue. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he should continue to work on changing her views. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any key ethical points here. The main issue is whether he's complicit. If he's actively trying to address it, then maybe he's not. If he's just ignoring it, that's different. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for dating her despite her racism. If he's making efforts, then perhaps not. But if he's enabling her racism, then yes. The text says he's trying to get her to stop, so B might be correct.\n"
