She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana for a week. They really like her and are happy. But there's a problem: Diana is racist against Black people. The author thinks it might be a cultural issue from Eastern Europe, where there's a history of racism. The author's dad had experiences in Russia where people were hostile towards Black individuals. The author is trying to help Diana not be racist when around friends and family. However, one of the author's friends, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: stop dating Diana or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted and wants to know if they're in the wrong by sticking with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The main issue is racism. The author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. The author is aware of this and is trying to work on it, but the friend is taking a strong stance. The friend is Black and feels betrayed, which adds a personal stake.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. While cultural context might explain some prejudices, it doesn't justify them. The author is choosing to be in a relationship with someone who expresses racist views, even if they're not acting on them in harmful ways beyond words. The friend feels that this is a betrayal, which is a strong social signal. \n\nBut the author is trying to address it, so maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions (dating someone with racist views) could be seen as complicit or supportive of those views, even if they're trying to change the person. The friend's reaction is strong, but is it justified? The author might not be wrong in the relationship itself, but perhaps in not addressing the racism more effectively. \n\nAlso, the author is being given an ultimatum, which is a harsh response, but the friend's perspective is that supporting a racist partner is a betrayal. The author might not be wrong per se, but they might be in a complicated situation where both sides have valid points. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if their actions cross a line. \n\nThe author's girlfriend's behavior includes making negative comments about Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. That's harmful and perpetuates stereotypes. The author's choice to stay in the relationship despite knowing this could be seen as supporting or enabling that racism, even if they're trying to change her. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're in a relationship with someone who expresses racism, and not taking a stronger stance against it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making an effort to address it. But the friend's reaction is about trust and loyalty. The author's friend might feel that by dating a racist, the author is not valuing Black people's well-being, which is a significant issue. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're in a relationship with a racist person and not taking a clear stance against racism, which can be seen as complicity.\n"
