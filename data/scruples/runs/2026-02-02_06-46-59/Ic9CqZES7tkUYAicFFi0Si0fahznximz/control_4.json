She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He really likes her, but she's racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to not express that racism, especially around his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is facing a conflict between his personal relationship and the values of his friend. The key points are whether the author is at fault for continuing the relationship despite her racism, and if he's handling the situation appropriately. \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and supporting or not addressing it in someone you care about can be problematic. The author is trying to address the behavior by asking Diana to change, which is a good step. However, changing someone's racist views isn't just up to the author. It's a complex social and personal issue that requires the person to acknowledge and work on their own biases. If Diana is resistant to change, the author might be enabling her behavior by staying in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in a position where he's trying to improve the situation by encouraging her to be more inclusive. But friends, especially those from marginalized communities, may feel that the author is complicit by not ending the relationship. The ultimatum from the Black friend adds pressure, but the author is trying to avoid making a choice between them. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be seen as problematic because it may validate or support those views. However, if the author is actively trying to change her behavior, that shows he's aware of the issue. The answer might depend on how the author is handling the situation. If he's making genuine efforts and Diana is open to change, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But if he's ignoring her racism or not taking it seriously enough, he could be complicit. \n\nAlso, the cultural context is mentioned. The author acknowledges that in Eastern Europe, such attitudes might be more common, but that doesn't excuse racism. Choosing to be with someone who is racist can be hurtful to others, especially when the author is making his friend choose between him and the relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if he's trying to address the issue, but he's in a morally ambiguous position. The key is whether he's actively working to counter her racism or just pretending it's not a problem. Since the situation is ongoing and he hasn't taken a definitive stand, the answer could be that he's in the wrong (A) because he's maintaining a relationship with a racist person despite knowing the harm it can cause, even if he's trying to influence her. Alternatively, if he's doing all he can and the friend is being too harsh, it might not be his fault (B). But generally, supporting a partner's racism, even unintentionally, can be seen as wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
