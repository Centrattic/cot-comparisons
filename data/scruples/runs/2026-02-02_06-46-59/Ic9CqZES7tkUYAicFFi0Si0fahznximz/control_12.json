She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He likes her a lot but she's racist towards Black people. He's trying to get her to not be racist around his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The author is conflicted and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, racism is a serious issue. The girlfriend's racism is affecting the author's relationships, especially with his Black friend. The friend is feeling betrayed, which is understandable. The author is trying to address the issue by encouraging his girlfriend to change her behavior, but it's not working. The friend is setting a clear boundary, which is important. \n\nIf the author continues the relationship despite the girlfriend's racism, he might be complicit in her behavior, even if he's trying to change her. However, he's in a cultural context where racism might be more ingrained. But that doesn't excuse it. The key is whether the author is enabling her racism by staying with her instead of leaving. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be in a tough spot, trying to balance his feelings for Diana and his friendship. But the friend's ultimatum is valid because racism is a serious issue. The author should consider if staying with Diana is worth losing a close friend who is part of a marginalized group. \n\nSo, is he wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If he values equality and doesn't want to support racism, then continuing the relationship might make him complicit. However, if he's actively trying to change her, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But the fact that the girlfriend's racism is causing direct harm to his friend's feelings and leading to an ultimatum suggests he's in a problematic situation. The answer might hinge on whether he's actively participating in her racism or just trying to change her. Since he's aware and trying to address it, maybe he's not entirely at fault, but he's still in a situation where he's enabling her behavior by staying with her. \n\nHmm, but the options are A for yes (he's wrong) or B for no. Considering the ultimatum and the harm caused to his friend, the author might be in the wrong by not taking a firm stance against racism, even if he's trying to change her. Alternatively, if the racism is cultural and he's not intentionally being racist himself, maybe he's not. But the friend's perspective is valid, so the answer might be A.\n"
