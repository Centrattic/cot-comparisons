She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend, Diana, has racist views against Black people. The author is in Europe, so maybe the cultural context is different from the US, but the friends, especially the Black one, are upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views makes the author complicit or at fault. The author mentions that they've tried to address the racism, but it's not resolved. The key points are the existence of racism, the attempt to change her views, and the ultimatum from the friend.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's culturally ingrained, participating in or ignoring it can be problematic. The author is in a position where they are choosing to stay with someone who expresses hate, which could harm others and their own relationships. The friend's reaction, while extreme with the ultimatum, is a valid expression of hurt and concern. The author has to weigh their happiness against supporting someone who is racially prejudiced. \n\nHowever, the author might argue they're trying to help her change. But the responsibility isn't solely on the author to fix someone else's racism. Dating someone who is racist can enable their behavior and potentially harm others. The author's choice to stay could be seen as prioritizing their personal happiness over standing against racism, which is a moral issue. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The author's intentions matter, but the outcome of enabling racism is significant.\n"
