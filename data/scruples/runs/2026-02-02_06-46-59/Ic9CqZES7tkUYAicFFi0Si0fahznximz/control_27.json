She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is they're dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who is described as racist against Black people. The user is in Europe, which might have different cultural contexts compared to other regions, but the issue is that Diana has expressed dislike towards Black people and said she wouldn't want to go to Africa. The user's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author is in the wrong for dating someone with racist views. The user is clearly trying to address the issue by working on changing Diana's views, which is a good step. But the problem here is the friend's reaction. The user is caught between their relationship and their friendship. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is a significant issue. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is pretty problematic, implying that the user must choose between their friends and their partner, which is a toxic and harmful stance. Friends shouldn't make such ultimatums, especially on issues of racism, which is a serious matter. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to handle the situation by engaging with Diana and the friend, which shows they care about both their relationship and their friendship. The user might be in a tough spot where they don't want to abandon their girlfriend over something they think can be changed, but they also don't want to lose a close friend. \n\nRacism is a harmful prejudice, and while it might be influenced by cultural background, it's not acceptable. The author's responsibility is to challenge and address racism, not just ignore it. However, the friend's approach is an ultimatum, which is not a healthy way to handle differing values. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Does the author support their girlfriend's racist views by staying with her? 2) Is the friend justified in threatening to end the friendship over this? 3) Are there other ways to handle the situation without breaking bonds?\n\nThe user is not okay with the racist behavior and is trying to address it, so they aren't endorsing it. The friend's reaction, however, is extreme. The user isn't in the wrong for trying to work on the issue and not immediately breaking up. But the author should also consider whether their partner is willing to change and how their continued relationship affects others. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for dating someone with racist views if they are actively trying to address it. The real problem is the friend's ultimatum and the girlfriend's racism itself. The answer should be No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
