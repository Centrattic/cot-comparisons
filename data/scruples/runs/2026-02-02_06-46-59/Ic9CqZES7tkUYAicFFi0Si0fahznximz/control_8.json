She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl who has racist views against black people. His friend, who is black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether the author is at fault. The key points are that the girl is racist, he's trying to change her, but his friend is angry. The author might think he's not in the wrong because he's trying to help her, but the friend sees it as betrayal.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if the girlfriend's racism is cultural, it's still harmful. The author is aware of her racism and is making an effort to address it, which is good. However, he's in a relationship with someone who holds these views, which can affect others, especially his friends. The friend is directly impacted because he's black and feels betrayed. The author's friend's reaction is valid because supporting someone's racism can be seen as complicity, even if you're trying to change them.\n\nThe author isn't directly committing the racism, but by being in a relationship with someone who is racist, he might be enabling it. The fact that his girlfriend has made specific racist comments against a Kenyan friend shows that her views are not just abstract but affect real people. The author's choice to stay with her despite the friend's ultimatum could be seen as prioritizing the relationship over his friend's well-being, which is a problem.\n\nHowever, the author is also trying to address the issue, which is a positive step. The complexity lies in whether changing someone's deep-seated views is possible and ethical. But the immediate harm to his friend is significant. The friend's \"bros before hoes\" comment is problematic because it trivializes the issue, but his stance is justified given the racism involved.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer might be yes because he's supporting someone with racist views that directly affect others. Even if he's trying to change her, the presence of racism in a relationship can be harmful. On the other hand, if he's genuinely working on it, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But considering the friend's perspective and the direct harm caused, the author's choice to stay with her might be seen as wrong.\n"
