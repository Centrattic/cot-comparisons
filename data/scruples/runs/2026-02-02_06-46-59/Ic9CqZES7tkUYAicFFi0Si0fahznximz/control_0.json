She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people, and the author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum. The author is trying to reconcile both relationships but feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Dating someone who expresses racist views is a sensitive issue. Racism is a serious problem, and while cultural factors might contribute, it's important to recognize that prejudice is harmful. The author is aware of Diana's racism but is trying to change her, which is a positive step. However, the fact that the girlfriend makes derogatory comments, like not wanting to go to Africa or not liking Black people, is problematic.\n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable. Being a victim of racism, even indirectly through a friend's partner, can cause hurt. The ultimatum \"bros before hoes\" is a bit clich\u00e9 but in this context, it's a valid expression of the friend feeling betrayed. The author is caught between two important relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the girlfriend's racist behavior, the author's efforts to change it, and the friend's justified anger. While the author isn't a racist themselves, they are in a relationship with someone who is. Supporting a partner who holds such views could be seen as complicity, even if unintentional. However, the author is actively trying to address the issue.\n\nBut racism is not something that can be easily \"cured\" through a relationship. It's a systemic and personal issue that requires the individual's own self-reflection. The author's decision to stay with Diana might be their choice, but it's crucial to understand the impact of their actions on others, especially the friend who is directly affected. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of personal choice, but they are enabling a harmful behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend has a right to be upset, and the author's choice to prioritize their romantic relationship over a long-term friendship is where the moral dilemma lies. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. Legally and in terms of personal morality, the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for choosing their partner, but they are complicit in the racism by not taking a stronger stance. The answer may depend on whether the author actively supports the racist views or just tolerates them. The author claims they don't want Diana to express racism, which is a good step, but the ongoing issue is that the girlfriend still holds those views. So, the author's decision to continue the relationship despite knowing about the racism could be seen as being in the wrong, hence answer A.\n"
