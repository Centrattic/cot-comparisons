She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who is racist against Black people. He really likes her and is happy with her, but she makes racist comments, like not liking Black people much and not wanting to go to Africa. The author is trying to make her stop being racist around friends and family. However, one of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The author is conflicted because he doesn't want to lose either.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue. The author is aware that his girlfriend's behavior is racist, even if he thinks it might be cultural. But he's choosing to stay in the relationship despite this. The friend is making a strong statement about loyalty, which might be hurtful, but his stance is that racism is unacceptable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by staying with Diana. On one hand, he's not the one being racist, but he's in a relationship with someone who is. Even if he's trying to change her, he's still associating with someone who holds racist views. On the other hand, he might not hold those views himself and is trying to address the issue. However, by continuing the relationship, he could be enabling her behavior or not taking a stand against racism. \n\nAlso, the friend's ultimatum is problematic because \"bros before hoes\" is a phrase that devalues the girlfriend's worth, but the friend is justified in being upset about racism. The author is caught between two people he cares about, but choosing to stay with the racist partner might mean turning against his friend. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one being racist, but by staying with Diana, he's not holding her accountable beyond asking her to stop. The fact that he's aware of her racism and the impact it's having on his friend yet still chooses to stay might imply that he's condoning her behavior, at least to some extent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not taking a stronger stand against racism. Even if he's trying to change her, continuing the relationship without her addressing her racism could be seen as supporting her views. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
