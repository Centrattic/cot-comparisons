She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves dating a girlfriend with racist views and facing an ultimatum from a friend.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with Diana, who expresses racism. The author is trying to help her change, which is a good step. But racism isn't something that can be easily fixed, especially if it's ingrained. The fact that the author is making an effort is positive, but the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite this.\n\nThe cultural context is mentioned\u2014Eastern Europe's history with racism. However, just because it's a cultural norm doesn't excuse it. The author is aware of the problem and is working on it, but the friend is upset, leading to a choice between the relationship and the friendship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The user's friend, who is Kenyan, feels betrayed. The friend's reaction is strong, but the author is trying to address the issue. However, being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be harmful, even if they're trying to change. The author might not be the one being racist, but supporting a partner with racist views could be problematic, especially if those views are causing direct harm to others (like the friend).\n\nBut the user is trying to help the girlfriend, which shows intent. However, the friend's ultimatum is harsh, and the author might feel pressured. The main question is about the author's responsibility. If the author continues the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend's racism, even if it's cultural, they might be enabling it. But if the author is actively working to counter it, maybe they're not at fault. \n\nOn the flip side, the friend's approach is an ultimatum, which is extreme. The author might not be in the wrong for choosing to be with their partner, but they also have a responsibility to stand against racism. However, the friend's inclusion of \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it dismisses the importance of the relationship. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend's racism is still present and affecting others. The author might not be directly racist, but by staying in the relationship, they might be complicit. But since the friend is making the ultimatum, the author is caught between two difficult choices. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author is enabling the racism or actively trying to change it. Since the author is making efforts, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the racism is causing direct harm to the friend, the author's continued support could be seen as wrong. But the friend's approach is also extreme. \n\nConsidering all points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to address the issue. The friend's reaction is more extreme. So, answer B (No).\n"
