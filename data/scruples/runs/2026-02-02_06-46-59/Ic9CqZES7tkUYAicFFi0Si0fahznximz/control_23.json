She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who he really likes, but she's racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, and his friend, who is Black, is upset that he's dating her and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the friend or the girlfriend. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is aware that Diana has racist views. He's trying to change her behavior, which is good. But the problem is that she's expressing racist comments, like saying she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The friend feels betrayed and is using a \"bros before hoes\" argument, which is a problematic phrase itself because it devalues the girlfriend. \n\nThe author is caught in a conflict. On one hand, he's trying to support his girlfriend but also wants to maintain the friendship. The friend is giving an ultimatum, which might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the fact that he's trying to address her racism shows he's aware of the issue. However, just because someone is trying to change a partner's behavior doesn't mean they're not complicit. If her racism is causing harm to others, even if she hasn't acted on it beyond words, supporting her could still be problematic. The author's friend is a direct victim here, being Black and hearing negative comments about his ethnicity. \n\nThe author might not be actively racist, but by continuing the relationship without seeing significant change, he's allowing the racist environment to persist. Also, the friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend in the face of her racism could be seen as choosing the girlfriend over the friend's well-being. However, the friend's approach is also harmful by reducing the situation to \"bros before hoes,\" which oversimplifies the relationship and the issue.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If he's aware of her racism and it's affecting a close friend, and he's not willing to distance himself if she doesn't change, maybe he is complicit. But if he's actively working on it, does that absolve him? It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the author is enabling the racism by continuing the relationship despite the hurt caused.\n"
