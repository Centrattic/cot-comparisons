She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girl is racist towards Black people, and the author is trying to address it, but his friend is giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author likes the girl a lot and is happy with her, but she has racist views. The friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and wants the author to choose between the relationship or the friendship. The author is trying to mediate and help the girl change her views.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's part of cultural background, it's harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. The author is in a position where he's supporting someone with racist tendencies, which can be problematic. The friend's reaction is understandable because racism directly affects him and his community.\n\nThe author's approach to help the girl change is positive, but it's important to recognize that he's also enabling her behavior by staying in the relationship instead of addressing it more firmly. The friend's ultimatum, while harsh, stems from valid hurt and a need for support.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Supporting racism, even if you're trying to change it, can be complicit. The author needs to take a stand against racism, not just for his friend's sake but because it's the right thing. So, the author might be in the wrong by not confronting the racism more effectively and by choosing the relationship over his friend's feelings.\n"
