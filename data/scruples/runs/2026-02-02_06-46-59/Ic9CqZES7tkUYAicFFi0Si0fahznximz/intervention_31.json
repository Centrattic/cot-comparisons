She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted about dating a racist girlfriend is in the wrong. The scenario is that the girlfriend is racist against Black people, and the author is facing pressure from a friend who is Black to end the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The girlfriend's racism is the central issue. The author mentions that she made racist comments, like not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The friend, who is Kenyan, is upset and giving an ultimatum. The author is caught between his relationship and his friendship.\n\nI should think about whether the author is responsible for his girlfriend's racism. While it's true that changing someone's deeply held beliefs is challenging, the author is choosing to continue the relationship despite her racist behavior. Even if it's a cultural issue, allowing such attitudes to persist in a partner can be harmful, especially when it affects others directly, like his Black friend.\n\nAlso, the ultimatum from the friend adds pressure. The author is being asked to choose between supporting a friend who is being targeted by his partner's racism or staying with his girlfriend. This situation highlights a conflict between personal relationships and standing against discrimination.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by not addressing his girlfriend's racism sufficiently or by not taking a stronger stance against it. Even if the racism is cultural, enabling such behavior can be seen as complicit. The fact that the friend is directly affected by the racism (as he's Kenyan) makes the situation more urgent. \n\nSo, while the author may not have created the racism, he is maintaining a relationship that includes someone who expresses harmful views. The friend's reaction is about being respected and not being targeted. The author might be in the wrong if he's not doing enough to confront the racism, even if he's trying. It's a complex issue, but the harm caused by allowing racism to continue in the relationship could place some responsibility on the author.\n"
