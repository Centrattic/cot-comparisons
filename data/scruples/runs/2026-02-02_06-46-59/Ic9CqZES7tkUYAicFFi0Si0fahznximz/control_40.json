She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is in a relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. They've been dating for a week and really like her. The issue is that Diana is \"kind of racist,\" specifically against black people. The user lives in Europe, and the context mentions that this might be a cultural thing from Eastern Europe. The user has tried to get Diana to stop being racist around friends and family. One of the user's friends, who is black and a close friend for three years, is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The friend says \"bros before hoes,\" and gives a few days to decide. The user is conflicted, trying to calm the friend down while also helping Diana change her views. The only racist act mentioned is Diana saying she doesn't like black people much and wouldn't want to go to Africa, with the friend being Kenyan.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault for dating someone with racist views and not making them change. Let's break it down.\n\nThe user is aware of their girlfriend's racism. They've tried to address it but haven't been successful yet. The user's friend is giving an ultimatum, which is causing conflict. The user is trying to navigate both relationships without losing either. \n\nNow, the key points here. Is the user responsible for their girlfriend's racism? Well, the user is not the one being racist; they're the one trying to address it. However, by staying in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, even if they're working on it, the user might be enabling that behavior by not taking a stronger stance. But since the user is actively trying to encourage Diana to change, that shows they're not complicit in her racism. \n\nThe user's friend's reaction is also a factor. The friend is making a public ultimatum, which can be hurtful and might not be the best way to handle the situation. However, the friend is standing up against racism, which is a valid concern. The user is caught between two conflicting loyalties.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user isn't being racist themselves; they're trying to correct their partner. The problem is the partner's racism, not the user's direct actions. However, relationships can affect others, and the user's choice to date someone who has racist views might be seen as problematic, especially if they don't address it more effectively. But the user is making an effort here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user isn't the one with the racist beliefs. The onus is on Diana to change her views, not the user. However, some might argue that the user should break up if their partner isn't willing to change. But the user is still in the early stages of the relationship (a week) and has been trying to work on it. The user hasn't given up on the relationship yet, which could be seen as reasonable given the time frame.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the user isn't wrong for not giving in to that. The user is trying to maintain both relationships, which is understandable. The user's actions are not inherently wrong unless they are supporting or condoning the racism, which they're not. They're actively trying to reduce it.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with a partner's racism and trying to manage it while facing pressure from a friend. The real issue is the girlfriend's racism and the friend's handling of the situation. The user is not the one at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
