She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is dating Diana, a Ukrainian girl, and really likes her. However, Diana is racist against black people. The author mentions that it's a cultural issue in Eastern Europe, and racism isn't easy to fix. The author has been trying to get Diana to not express her racism around friends and family. One of the author's friends, a black person, is upset and wants the author to choose between the friend and the girlfriend, using the \"bros before hoes\" argument. The author is conflicted and trying to manage both relationships.\n\nFirst, I should consider if racism is something that can be overlooked in a relationship. Racism is a serious issue that affects others and can lead to harm. Even if it's cultural, it's important to address because it's a form of discrimination. The fact that the girlfriend says she doesn't like black people and avoids Africa (Kenya) is a clear expression of prejudice. \n\nThe author is trying to change her behavior, but it's not clear if the girlfriend is willing to change. If someone is racist and not making an effort to unlearn it, that can be a red flag. The author's friend is being directly targeted by the girlfriend's racism, so the friend's reaction is understandable. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but the friend has a right to be upset if his race is being disrespected.\n\nHowever, the author might feel that he's not the one being racist and is trying to be a good partner by addressing the issue. But if the girlfriend continues to express racism despite the author's efforts, it might indicate that her views are deeply entrenched and not changeable. In that case, the author might be enabling or excusing her racism by staying with her.\n\nAlso, the author's own stance on racism matters. If he genuinely opposes racism but doesn't take a stand against his partner's views, that could be seen as complicity. The friend's complaint is about being betrayed, which could be valid if the author isn't taking his friend's feelings into account.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. But the key points are: the girlfriend's racism is harmful, the author is aware but hasn't ended the relationship, and the friend feels betrayed. If the author continues to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism and the friend's objections, he might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing the relationship over standing up against racism, especially when it's affecting a friend directly.\n\nAnother angle: cultural background doesn't excuse racism. Even if it's common in her environment, systemic racism is still wrong. The author might be justifying her behavior by calling it cultural, which is a form of relativism that's not acceptable when it comes to human rights issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is trying to address the issue, the fact that he's choosing to stay with a racist partner despite the harm caused to others suggests he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
