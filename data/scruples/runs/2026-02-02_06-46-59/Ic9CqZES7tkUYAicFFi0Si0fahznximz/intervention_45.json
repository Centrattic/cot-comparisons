She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who he really likes, but she's racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. His best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friend. The author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is aware of the racism and is trying to address it, but it's not working. The friend feels betrayed, which is a valid feeling. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite the racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's a cultural thing, as the author suggests, that doesn't excuse it. The fact that Diana made specific racist comments, like disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa, is problematic. The author's friend is part of the group being targeted, so his reaction is understandable. Choosing to stay with the girlfriend over a close friend who's being discriminated against could be seen as prioritizing personal feelings over standing against racism.\n\nThe author argues that changing someone's racism is a long process, but that doesn't mean it's acceptable to continue in a relationship where harmful attitudes exist. The girlfriend's racism affects others, especially his Black friend, who is directly impacted. The ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism might be seen as supporting her views, even if he's trying to change her mind.\n\nHowever, the author is in a personal relationship and might not want to abandon someone just because they have racist views, especially if he's working on addressing it. But the reality is that racism is harmful, and by staying with her, he's potentially enabling her behavior and the hurt it causes to others. The friend's perspective is that the author is betraying them by associating with someone who hates their community.\n\nSo, balancing these points: the author is aware of the racism, is trying to change her, but the situation is causing harm to his friend. If he continues the relationship, he's allowing the racist behavior to persist in his social circle, which could be seen as complicity. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong for not taking a stronger stand against the racism, even if he's trying to address it. Or perhaps the friend's ultimatum is too extreme, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend under these circumstances could be considered wrong because it prioritizes the relationship over opposing racism.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author isn't directly committing the racist acts, so he's not wrong for being in a relationship with someone who has those views. But that line of thinking could enable harmful behavior. The key is whether being in a relationship with a racist person is inherently wrong, and whether the author is complicit by not ending the relationship despite the offensive behavior.\n\nGiven that the friend is Black and is being directly affected, the author's decision to continue the relationship despite knowing the racism might be seen as supporting the girlfriend's views, hence making him in the wrong. The answer might be A, he is in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because relationships are personal, and changing someone's views is complex. However, the harm caused to the friend and others should be considered. So leaning towards A.\n"
