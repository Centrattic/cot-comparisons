She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana for a week. He really likes her and mentions she's beautiful, smart, funny, etc. But the problem is her racism against Black people. He points out that in Eastern Europe, this might be more culturally accepted, but he's trying to change her behavior. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He doesn't want to choose but is also trying to make Diana less racist. The question is whether he's in the wrong by staying with Diana despite her racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Dating someone who holds racist views can be problematic because it supports and perpetuates harmful attitudes. Even if the racism stems from cultural background, allowing it to continue without addressing it can be complicit. The author is aware of the issue and is trying to change her behavior, which is a good step, but if she's not changing despite his efforts, maybe he's enabling her racism by staying in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is harsh. While racism is a serious issue, making a friend choose between a romantic relationship and friendship can be seen as extreme. However, the friend is expressing valid concerns about being treated as lesser because of his race.\n\nThe key points are: Is the author wrong for staying with a racist partner? If the girlfriend isn't changing, then staying might be complicit in her racism. However, the author is trying to address the issue, which shows he's not fully supportive of her views. But the fact that he's choosing to be in a relationship with someone who has these views, even if they're cultural, might make him complicit, especially if he's not willing to leave despite the friend's valid objections.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing the relationship over standing against racism. Even if the racism is cultural, supporting someone's racist views by staying with them sends the wrong message. The friend's anger is justified because the racism directly affects him. The author should consider whether he can genuinely support a partner who holds these views, even if they're trying to change. There's a difference between being influenced by culture and actively being racist. If the girlfriend isn't making efforts to change beyond what the author is doing, the relationship might not be healthy for the long term. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
