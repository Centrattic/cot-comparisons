She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario is that the author is dating a Ukrainian woman named Diana who has racist views against Black people. Some context is given that this might be cultural, especially in Eastern Europe, and the author is trying to address her racism but is facing pressure from a friend who is Black to choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Dating someone with racist views can be problematic because it normalizes harmful attitudes. Racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds such views might support or enable that behavior. Even if the author is trying to change her, it's not the person's responsibility to change another's prejudices. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author is caught in the middle.\n\nOn one hand, the author might not be directly responsible for the girlfriend's racism, as it's part of her cultural background. But being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be hurtful, especially if those views are expressed publicly or affect others. The fact that the friend is Black and feels betrayed suggests that the girlfriend's comments are not just casual but offensive and hurtful.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's racism is the main issue. The author is trying to address it, but if those efforts aren't effective, continuing the relationship might imply acceptance of her racist views. The author might be in a position where they're complicit by not leaving the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend's prejudices.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they are trying to change her, and that the friend's reaction is too harsh. But the fact that the friend is making an ultimatum shows the severity of the situation from his perspective. The author's responsibility could be questioned for not taking a stronger stance against racism in his partner.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, while some might argue that it's a cultural issue, that doesn't excuse the racism. It's important to recognize that racism is a personal choice and can be challenged regardless of cultural norms. The author might be enabling the girlfriend's behavior by not holding her accountable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a tough spot, but by staying with the girlfriend despite her racism and facing conflict with a friend who is directly affected, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not prioritizing anti-racism in their relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
