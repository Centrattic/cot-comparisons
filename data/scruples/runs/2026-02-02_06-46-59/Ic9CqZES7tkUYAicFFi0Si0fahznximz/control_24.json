She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum to end the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Dating someone who holds racist beliefs can be problematic because it supports or at least tolerates that behavior. The author is aware of the racism and is trying to change the girlfriend, but it's not working. The friend feels betrayed, which is a valid reaction given the personal connection and the hurt caused by the racism.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to evaluate based on the information provided. The author is in a relationship with someone who has racist views and is facing pressure from a friend. The key points are: the girlfriend's racism, the author's attempts to address it, and the ultimatum from the friend.\n\nThe author is not directly being racist themselves but is in a relationship with someone who is. The question is whether that makes the author at fault. Some might argue that the author is complicit by not ending the relationship, while others might say that they are trying to change her. However, the presence of an ultimatum from a close friend adds another layer. The author is caught between two important relationships and may be making a choice based on personal happiness versus standing up against racism.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, supporting someone's racist views by continuing the relationship could be seen as problematic. However, the author is trying to address the issue, which shows some level of awareness. The fact that the racism is described as cultural might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't excuse it. The friend's reaction is valid because the author's choice affects their personal relationship and the friend's feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author continues the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend's racism and the hurt it causes to their friend, they might be considered complicit. However, if they are actively trying to change her views, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But ultimately, staying in the relationship could be seen as supporting her racism, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but I need to be careful. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is in a relationship with a racist person and doesn't take a stand, they might be in the wrong. But if they're trying to change her, maybe not. However, the fact that the friend feels betrayed suggests that the author's choice is indeed problematic. So the answer is A (Yes).\n"
