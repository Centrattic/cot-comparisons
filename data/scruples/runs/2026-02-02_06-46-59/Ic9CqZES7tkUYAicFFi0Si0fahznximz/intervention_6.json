She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being racist towards Black people, and the author's friend is upset, leading to an ultimatum. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a significant issue. The author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which can be hurtful and harmful. Even if the racism is cultural, it's still a problem. The author is trying to change her views, but the friend is upset and gives an ultimatum.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Dating someone with racist views can be problematic because racism is a serious issue that affects others. The author's friend, who is Black, is hurt and feels betrayed, which adds another layer. The author is caught between his relationship and his friendship. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, possibly because they believe the author should prioritize his friend's feelings over his girlfriend. Alternatively, maybe they think the author isn't doing enough to address the racism. \n\nI should consider that while the author might not be a racist himself, being in a relationship with someone who is can still be hurtful to others. The author's friend has a valid reason to be upset. However, the author might not have directly caused the racism; it's part of the girlfriend's culture. But that doesn't excuse it. \n\nOn the other hand, changing someone's views is difficult, and the author is trying. But the friend's ultimatum is harsh, and the author is being forced to choose. The author might feel he's not in the wrong because he's not the racist one. \n\nIn terms of ethics, supporting racism is wrong, so being in a relationship with someone who is racist could be seen as enabling or not taking a stand against it. Even if the author isn't racist, continuing the relationship without addressing it properly might be seen as complicit. \n\nThe friend's reaction is intense, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as prioritizing his own happiness over the feelings of his friend. However, the friend's ultimatum is also problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the racism adequately and for choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite knowing it's hurting his friend. The key here is that racism is a serious issue, and the author's inaction could make him complicit. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
