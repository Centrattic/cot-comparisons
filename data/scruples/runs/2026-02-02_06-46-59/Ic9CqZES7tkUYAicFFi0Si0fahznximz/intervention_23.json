She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is facing a dilemma between their girlfriend, Diana, who holds racist views against Black people, and their best friend who is Black and feels betrayed by the relationship. The friend has given an ultimatum: end the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views affect others. The author mentions that Diana's racism isn't overtly aggressive but includes statements like disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. While it's possible that these views are influenced by cultural factors in Eastern Europe, that doesn't excuse the racism. The author is trying to encourage Diana to change, which is commendable, but the persistence of her views and the impact on others is a concern.\n\nThe best friend, who is Kenyan, feels betrayed, which is understandable. Choosing between friends and family is a tough spot, but the friend's ultimatum (\"bros before hoes\") adds a layer of toxicity. However, the friend's stance is also valid in terms of standing up against racism. The author is caught in the middle, trying to navigate both relationships while maintaining their happiness and integrity.\n\nNow, the key question: Is the author in the wrong? The author isn't the one with the racist views, so they can't be blamed for that. However, by continuing to date someone who holds those views despite knowing the impact on their friend, there's a moral consideration. The author has a responsibility to align with their values. If they value their friend's feelings and oppose racism, staying in the relationship despite Diana's views could be seen as complicit, even if they're trying to change her. \n\nOn the other hand, changing someone's deeply held beliefs is difficult and not the fault of the person trying to influence change. The author is making an effort, which is positive, but the situation is complex. The friend's reaction is intense, but the ultimatum is extreme. However, the friend's stance is about personal values and the impact of the relationship on them, which is valid.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for the racism itself, as they're not the one with the prejudiced views. But there's a question about whether they're inadvertently supporting racism by staying with Diana. However, the answer might hinge on whether the author is actively enabling her views or if they're genuinely trying to address the issue. Given the effort to change her behavior, the answer might lean towards \"Not the Asshole,\" but there's a nuance here. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but their feelings are justified. The author is in a tough spot, but ultimately, their stance against racism and efforts to mitigate it could mean they're not in the wrong. However, the decision to stay in the relationship despite knowing the friend is hurt could be seen as a failure to prioritize their values. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're potentially supporting a racist relationship despite knowing the harm it causes to their friend. But maybe not. Wait, maybe the answer is B because they're trying to change her. Hmm. This is tricky. The key is that the author isn't the one being racist, but their choice to stay with her while she's being racist is problematic. However, the friend's reaction is also extreme. I think the author is partially at fault for not recognizing the seriousness of the situation and putting pressure on the friend. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the friend's valid hurt feelings and the author's failure to fully address the racism, maybe A is the answer. Alternatively, B if the effort to change her is enough. I'm torn. But given that the friend is Black and the author is choosing to stay with a racist partner, leading to the friend feeling betrayed, the author is in the wrong. So A.\n"
