She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views against Black people. He really likes her and they've been dating for a week. His friend, who is Black, is upset that he's dating someone racist and is giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that racism in Eastern Europe might be more culturally accepted, but that doesn't excuse it. He's trying to get his girlfriend to stop being racist, which is commendable, but if she's unwilling to change, that's a problem. The friend is making a strong stance, which is understandable given the personal connection. The friend's argument is that the author is betraying him by dating someone racist, which is a serious accusation. \n\nThe author is caught between two important relationships. On one hand, he's in love with Diana, who he describes as great in almost every other way except for the racism. On the other hand, his best friend is feeling betrayed and is cutting him off unless he breaks up with her. The author's stance is that he doesn't want to choose, but his friend is forcing his hand. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, supporting racism in any form is wrong. If Diana is making racist remarks and he's in a relationship with her, he might be enabling her behavior, even if he's trying to change her. But since he's actively trying to get her to stop, maybe he's not fully complicit. However, the friend's position is valid because being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be seen as a betrayal, especially to a close friend who's a victim of that racism. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because he's choosing to prioritize his romantic relationship despite knowing the harm caused by her racism, even if it's a cultural issue. But if he's genuinely trying to address her racism, there's a case for his innocence. However, the fact that he's been dating her for only a week suggests he might be in denial about the seriousness of her views. \n\nAlso, the cultural context is mentioned. The author says that in Eastern Europe, racism is more accepted, but that's not an excuse for the behavior. Racism is wrong regardless of where it's coming from. The fact that his friend is Kenyan and directly affected adds weight to the friend's argument. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's in a relationship with someone who is racist, which could be seen as a personal betrayal to his friend, even if he's trying to change her. But the situation is complex because he's trying to address the issue. However, the ultimatum from the friend complicates things. The author's responsibility includes not supporting harmful behaviors, and if he can't convince his girlfriend to change, maybe he's not in the wrong, but there's a strong case for him being in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite knowing the racist views.\n"
