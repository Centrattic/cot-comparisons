She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that his girlfriend, Diana, is racist against black people, and his friend is giving him an ultimatum to choose between her or the friend. The author is trying to handle it by working on changing her views but the friend isn't budging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views affect how they treat others. The key points are whether the author is complicit in her racism by staying with her, and if he's wrong to prioritize his relationship over his friend's feelings.\n\nThe author mentions that he's trying to get Diana to not be racist, which shows he's aware of the issue and attempting to address it. However, changing someone's deeply held beliefs is difficult and not always possible. The friend, being black himself, is hurt and feels betrayed, which is understandable. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it devalues the friend's concerns and reduces the situation to a trivial choice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's making an effort to change her behavior, which is commendable. On the other, by staying with her despite her racism, he might be enabling her views or not taking them seriously enough. However, the author isn't the one being racist; he's the one trying to address it. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, and the author is caught between two difficult choices. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't the one being racist, so he's not directly at fault. However, the situation is complex because relationships can influence each other's behaviors. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to address the issue and isn't the one holding racist views. The real issue lies with the girlfriend's racism and the friend's ultimatum. The friend's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for staying with Diana if he's making an effort to change her behavior.\n"
