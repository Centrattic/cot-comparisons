She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to change her behavior but faces pushback from friends, especially a close Black friend who gives an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is at fault. The key points here are about racism and personal choices. Dating someone with racist views isn't inherently wrong, but there are implications. The author is aware of the issue and is trying to address it, which shows some responsibility. However, racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds such views can be problematic, especially if those views harm others or are not acknowledged by the person in question.\n\nThe author mentions that some of his friends, including a Black one, are upset. The friend feels betrayed and sets an ultimatum. The author is caught between his relationship and his friendship. The question is whether the author is wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a harmful ideology that can lead to discrimination and exclusion. By continuing the relationship, the author might be enabling or normalizing those views. Even if the author is trying to change her, the presence of racist attitudes can affect others, especially if the girlfriend expresses them in public. The fact that the girlfriend doesn't like Black people and refuses to go to Africa indicates a level of prejudice that could impact the author's relationships and social environment.\n\nHowever, the author isn't the one being racist; he's the one trying to address it. But the responsibility isn't just on the author\u2014it's also on the girlfriend to recognize and change her own behavior. The author's stance here might be seen as not holding his girlfriend accountable enough, especially if her views are causing harm to others. The ultimatum from his friend highlights the tension between personal relationships and standing up against racism.\n\nIn terms of ethics, supporting someone's racist views could be considered complicit in a broader societal issue. Even if the author isn't explicitly racist himself, being in a relationship with someone who is can lead to indirect support of that ideology. The author's decision to stay with the girlfriend despite the conflict with his friend might be seen as prioritizing the romantic relationship over the well-being and feelings of a friend who is directly affected by racism.\n\nOn the other hand, changing someone's deeply held beliefs is complex and not always possible. The author's intention to help her change is positive, but if those efforts aren't effective, he may be in a difficult position. However, the key issue here is whether the author is wrong for not breaking up with someone who is openly racist. Given that racism is a serious issue and the author's friend is being directly impacted, the author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's ultimatum could be seen as a judgment call. \n\nBut considering that the author is aware of the problem and is making an effort, yet the girlfriend's views are causing direct harm to others (his friend's feelings and the potential for more offensive behavior), the author's choice to stay with her could be viewed as enabling the racism. The correct answer might lean towards the author being at fault because he's choosing to remain in a relationship that perpetuates harmful attitudes, even if he's trying to change those views. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's supporting someone with racist views despite knowing the impact on others.\n"
