She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The main points are: the girlfriend is racist against Black people, the user is trying to change her opinions, a friend is giving an ultimatum between the girlfriend and the friendship, and the user is conflicted.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's racism is a significant issue. Even if the user thinks it's cultural, racism is harmful and shouldn't be excused as a cultural norm. The user's friend is a Black person who's hurt and feels betrayed, which is valid. The user is caught between two important relationships. \n\nThe user's argument is that he's trying to help her overcome racism, but that's not enough. Just because someone is \"trying\" doesn't mean the racist behavior is acceptable. The girlfriend's actions are still harmful, and the user might be enabling her by staying in the relationship. \n\nThe friend is right to feel upset because the user is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his feelings are justified. The user is choosing between his girlfriend and his best friend, which is a tough spot, but not necessarily his fault. However, staying with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as supporting her harmful views, which makes him complicit. \n\nBut here's the catch: the user isn't the one being racist; he's the one trying to address it. However, he's also not taking a firm stand against her racism. By not ending the relationship despite her harmful views, he might be in the wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for dating her. If he's aware of her racism and chooses to stay, that's part of the issue. But if he's actively trying to help her change, maybe he's not entirely at fault. \n\nWait, the user is also not the one who is racist. The racism is from the girlfriend. So the user's wrong is more about not addressing the racism in the relationship. But the user is trying to change her. However, just because someone is in a relationship with a racist doesn't inherently make them wrong, unless they are promoting or supporting the racism. But the user is trying to get her to stop. The friend is upset because the user isn't taking a stand, but the user is in a complicated position. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the user isn't in the wrong for dating her, but he's not helping her change enough. But the friend's reaction is also valid. The user is stuck between two wrongs, but he's not the one being racist. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for dating her, but he should consider the impact of staying with a racist partner. So answer B.\n"
