She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy dating a Ukrainian girl who is racist against black people. The guy likes her a lot but is facing pressure from a friend who is black, leading to an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend has racist views, which the guy is trying to address. His friend, who is black, feels betrayed and is giving an ultimatum. The guy is caught between his relationship and his friendship.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's culturally influenced, it's harmful and shouldn't be tolerated. The guy's friend is standing up for himself, which is understandable. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, which makes sense because choosing a racist partner over a close friend who is a victim of that racism could be seen as prioritizing a harmful relationship.\n\nBut wait, the guy is trying to change her behavior. However, that's a complex and long process. The question is whether he's in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite the racism. If he stays with her, he might be enabling her views, even if he's trying to help. On the other hand, his friend is using an ultimatum, which is a strong move but valid given the situation.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the guy's actions (staying with a racist partner) are wrong. If he continues the relationship, he's not just passive; he's in a relationship with someone who holds harmful beliefs. Even if it's not extreme, the act of being in such a relationship can be problematic, especially when others are affected. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's perpetuating a harmful dynamic by staying with her despite knowing the racist views, even if he's trying to address them. The friend's reaction is a consequence of that choice.\n"
