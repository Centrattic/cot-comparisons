She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend, Diana, has racist views against Black people, which the author is trying to address. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: stop the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author is in a relationship with someone who expresses dislike towards a specific racial group. Even if it's a cultural norm in her background, that doesn't justify the racism. The author is trying to change her behavior, which is commendable, but maybe it's not enough. \n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, but \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic phrase that prioritizes friendship over considering the harm caused by racism. However, the friend's concern is valid in that supporting a racist partner can be harmful. The author is caught between two important relationships and is being forced to choose. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's involved with someone who is racist, even if he's trying to address it. But does that make him complicit? It might depend on his level of awareness and actions. He's trying to change her behavior, which shows he's not fully endorsing her views. However, staying in the relationship could still be seen as tolerating racism, which is a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's ultimatum oversimplifies the issue. It's not a simple choice between friendship and a relationship, especially when it's a complex social issue. The author might not be entirely at fault for dating someone with those views, but he could be missing the severity of the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is making an effort to address the racism, he might still be in the wrong by continuing the relationship if it perpetuates harmful attitudes. However, the friend's approach is also flawed. The answer hinges on whether supporting someone with racist views is acceptable, which generally it isn't. So, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the seriousness and choosing to stay in the relationship despite the issues.\n"
