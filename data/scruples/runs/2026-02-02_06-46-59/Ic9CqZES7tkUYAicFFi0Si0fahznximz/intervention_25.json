She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being racist towards Black people, and his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the racism might be cultural, pointing to Eastern European influences. But even if it's cultural, does that justify the racist behavior? Probably not. Racism is a personal choice, even if influenced by upbringing or environment. The author is trying to change her, but if she's unwilling, that could be a problem.\n\nThe friend is Black and is upset because the author is dating someone who expresses racism towards Black people. The friend feels betrayed, which is understandable. The author is caught between his relationship and his friendship. The friend sets an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The author is struggling with this.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, dating someone who is racist can be problematic, especially if that racism affects others around you. The author's friend is directly impacted by the girlfriend's comments. The author might not be a racist himself, but he's choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, even if he's trying to change her. However, changing someone's deeply held beliefs is difficult, and the author might not have control over her behavior in the long run.\n\nThe key points here are the impact of the girlfriend's racism on others (like the author's Black friend) and whether the author should hold his girlfriend accountable. If the girlfriend's racism is causing harm to others, the author might be complicit by not addressing it more forcefully. But if he's actively trying to change her, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, the friend's reaction is about feeling betrayed, which is a valid emotion. The author might be in a tough spot, but he's also enabling the racism by continuing the relationship despite knowing the issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's choosing to be in a relationship with someone whose racism affects others, and he's not fully addressing it, leading his friend to feel betrayed.\n"
