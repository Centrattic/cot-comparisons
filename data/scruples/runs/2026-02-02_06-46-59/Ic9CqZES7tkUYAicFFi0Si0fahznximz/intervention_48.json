She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views against black people, specifically mentioning a Kenyan friend. The author is torn between his girlfriend and a close black friend who is giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the friend's reaction. The author claims that racism in Eastern Europe is cultural and hard to change. But is it acceptable to date someone with racist views, especially when it affects your friendship? The friend feels betrayed and is using a \"bro before hoes\" ultimatum, which might not be the healthiest approach, but his concern is valid.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is a bit tricky. While it's true that changing someone's deeply held beliefs isn't easy, being in a relationship with someone who expresses racism can be hurtful, especially if those views are targeted at a friend you care about. The girlfriend's comments are overtly racist, and even if it's cultural, the author is complicit by not addressing it more effectively. The fact that the author's friend is directly affected by the girlfriend's remarks adds another layer. The author's friends are upset because they see the relationship as a betrayal, which the author might not agree with, but they do have a right to feel uncomfortable.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to balance his feelings for Diana with his friend's values. On the other, staying in a relationship where racism is present could perpetuate harmful attitudes. The author's argument that it's a cultural issue might not justify staying with her if it's causing direct harm to others. Also, the phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it devalues the friend's feelings and implies that the relationship is less important than friendship, but that doesn't mean the author has done something wrong by prioritizing the relationship.\n\nHowever, the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship. Dating someone with racist views can be seen as supporting those views, even if it's cultural. The author has a responsibility to challenge harmful behaviors in a relationship. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's choice to stay with Diana despite her racism might be seen as prioritizing the relationship over standing against racism, which could be considered wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's continuing a relationship that includes racist behavior, which harms others, and not taking sufficient steps to address it.\n"
