She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The main issue here is the girlfriend's racism and the conflict with the user's friends, especially the black friend who's making an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's actions. She's explicitly racist against black people, which is a serious issue. The user mentions that she doesn't like black people and doesn't want to go to Africa. That's a clear expression of racism. Even if it's a cultural thing in some parts of Eastern Europe, racism is still harmful and should be addressed.\n\nThe user is trying to change her behavior, which is commendable, but there's a limit to how much someone can or should tolerate racism in a relationship. The fact that the girlfriend hasn't shown any willingness to change beyond what the user is asking might be a problem. If she's not making an effort to unlearn her racist views, that could be a red flag.\n\nThen there's the conflict with the best friend. The friend feels betrayed because the user is dating someone racist, and he's giving an ultimatum: girlfriend or him. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it dismisses the importance of the relationship and the girlfriend's humanity. However, the friend's stance on racism being a deal-breaker is valid. Supporting a racist partner can be seen as complicity, which the friend is rightfully upset about.\n\nThe user is caught between two people he cares about. But the key point is whether the user is in the wrong. By staying with the girlfriend despite her racism, he might be enabling her behavior and ignoring the impact it has on others, especially his friend. The user's responsibility includes not perpetuating or supporting racism, even if it's part of the girlfriend's culture. Cultural norms don't excuse harmful behavior like racism.\n\nThe user's argument that changing someone's racism is a long process is true, but it's not the sole responsibility of the non-racist person to fix the racist. The girlfriend should take accountability for her own actions. If the user continues the relationship without addressing it properly, he could be complicit in her racism, which makes him at least partially responsible.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the girlfriend's racism is a significant issue, the friend's valid concerns about betrayal, and the user's role in continuing the relationship despite knowing about her racism, it seems the user is in the wrong for not taking a firm stance against racism in his partner. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
