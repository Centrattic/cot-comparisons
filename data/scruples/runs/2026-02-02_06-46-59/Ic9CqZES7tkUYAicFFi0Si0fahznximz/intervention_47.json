She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about dating a girl who's racist, and facing an ultimatum from a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is dating Diana, a Ukrainian girl, and really likes her. However, she's racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. One of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friend. The author is trying to calm the friend down and also work on changing Diana's views.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism. Let's consider different angles. \n\nOn one hand, the author is in a new relationship (only a week) and is clearly invested in her. He's making an effort to address her racism, which is commendable. He might be trying to support her while also respecting his friend's feelings. But here's the thing: racism is a serious issue. If someone is openly racist, especially against specific groups, it's a red flag. The fact that the author's friend is directly affected and is giving an ultimatum suggests that his friend's comfort and safety are at stake. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known about her racism before dating her. He could be in the process of helping her change, but changing someone's deeply held beliefs isn't something a partner can force. It's possible that by staying in the relationship, he's enabling her behavior and not holding her accountable. Also, the fact that she's made racist comments about not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa is direct and harmful. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum, while harsh (\"bros before hoes\"), is coming from a place of concern. If the author continues the relationship, he's prioritizing the romantic relationship over the friendship, which could be seen as choosing the girlfriend over a friend who's being targeted by the girlfriend's racism. That could be hurting the friend and possibly making him complicit in the racism by not taking a clear stance.\n\nBut wait, the author might not be in the wrong if he's genuinely trying to address the issue. However, the key here is that racism is a personal choice and a serious issue. Supporting a partner's racism could be harmful. The author is caught between two people: his girlfriend and his friend. The fact that the friend is Black and directly affected by the racism adds weight to the friend's perspective. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to align your values. If the author values anti-racism, staying with someone who isn't willing to change could mean he's complicit. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as supporting harmful views. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not adequately addressing the racism in his partner, and by staying with her, he's allowing the racist behavior to continue, which affects his friend negatively. Even if he's trying to change her, the reality is that he's in a position where he can't force her to change. The friend's stance, while harsh, is about his right to not be in a relationship where his friend is dating someone who hates his race. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author is in a new relationship and giving her a chance is fair. But racism isn't something that can be easily changed through a new relationship. The author might be ignoring the severity of the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not taking a clear stand against racism, which harms his friend. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
