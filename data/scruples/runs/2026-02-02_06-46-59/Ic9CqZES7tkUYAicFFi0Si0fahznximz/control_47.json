She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views towards Black people. The author likes her a lot, but some friends, including a close Black friend, are upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue. Even if the author believes it's a cultural thing, allowing someone to express racist views, especially towards Black people, can be harmful. The author's friend feels betrayed and is using the \"bros before hoes\" argument, which is a problematic phrase that downplays the value of relationships with people of color.\n\nThe author is trying to change Diana's views, but it's not clear if he's actively challenging her racism or just ignoring it. Justifying it as cultural might be a way to avoid confronting the issue. The fact that Diana makes specific racist comments, like disliking Black people or not wanting to go to Africa, shows a personal prejudice beyond just cultural norms.\n\nThe author is being given an ultimatum by his friend, which is a serious decision. But the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship. Supporting someone's racism, even if it's cultural, can be seen as complicity. The author's responsibility is to stand against racism, especially when it affects a friend's well-being. Choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite the friend's valid concerns might make the author complicit in the racism.\n\nHowever, the author might be in a difficult position, trying to balance relationships. But in terms of right and wrong, allowing racism to persist in his partner and not taking a clear stance against it could place him in the wrong. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he's supporting a racist relationship, which is harmful and perpetuates systemic issues.\n"
