She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who has racist views towards Black people. The author likes her a lot, but some friends, including a Black friend, are upset. The friend is giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Racism is a serious issue. The author is aware that his girlfriend holds racist beliefs and has been trying to change her mind, but she hasn't changed. The friend who is Black feels betrayed by the author for continuing the relationship, which leads to the ultimatum.\n\nThe author is caught between his feelings for his girlfriend and his friendship with someone who is directly affected by the racism. The question is whether he's in the wrong for choosing to stay with his girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that he's not responsible for his girlfriend's views, and that he's not personally racist. He's making an effort to address the issue, which is commendable. But on the other hand, by choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist views and not ending it despite being asked by a close friend, he might be enabling or condoning that behavior. Relationships require mutual respect and values, so if racism is a deal-breaker for the author, he should consider that. However, if he's okay with her views and doesn't see her actions as harmful, that's his choice, but others might see it as supporting a harmful ideology.\n\nThe cultural context is mentioned, with the author suggesting it's part of the culture in Eastern Europe. However, that doesn't excuse racism. Even if it's common, it's still wrong. The author's friend is a direct victim here, so the friendship is being tested. The ultimatum is harsh, but the author might be seen as choosing his girlfriend over standing up against racism, which could be seen as a betrayal of his friend's values.\n\nSo, the author's position is that he's not in the wrong because he's not the one being racist, but he's still choosing to stay with someone who is. The key point is whether one can be held responsible for being in a relationship with someone who has harmful views. In my view, the author is not the one being racist, but by not ending the relationship despite the harm it's causing to his friend, he's allowing the racist views to persist in his circle. That could be seen as complicity, even if he's not personally racist.\n\nBut then again, it's his choice who he dates. However, if he's aware that the person he's dating has harmful beliefs and continues the relationship, he might be contributing to an environment where racism isn't addressed. So, the answer could be that he is in the wrong because he's not standing against racism when he has the power to do so by ending the relationship. Alternatively, if he's making efforts to change her views, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that she hasn't changed and he's still with her might indicate that he's choosing his feelings over the values of his friend.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's actions support or condone racism. If he's aware and chooses to stay, he's implicitly supporting her views. That makes him complicit, even if he's not the one being racist. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not taking a stand when his friend is directly affected.\n"
