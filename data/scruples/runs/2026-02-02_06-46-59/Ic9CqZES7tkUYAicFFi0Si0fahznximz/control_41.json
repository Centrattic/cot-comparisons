She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. So first, I need to look at the details provided.\n\nThe author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman, Diana. She's described as beautiful, smart, funny, etc., but there's an issue with her being racist against Black people. The author mentions that in Eastern Europe, this might be more common, and he's trying to change her views. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The friend uses \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase itself because it devalues relationships and people. \n\nNow, the key points here are about racism. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views are directed at others. The author is trying to change her, but that's not always effective. Also, the friend's reaction, while extreme, is in response to the girlfriend's racism. The author is caught between two important relationships: his girlfriend and his friend. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is aware of the racism and continues the relationship despite knowing the harm it can cause, he might be complicit. However, he's also trying to address it. On the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is harsh, but racism is a significant issue. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in a tough spot. But ultimately, supporting someone with racist views, even if it's culturally influenced, can be seen as wrong because it perpetuates harmful attitudes. The author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite the friend's valid concerns might mean he's prioritizing the relationship over standing against racism. However, the friend's approach is also flawed. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily the one with the racism; he's in a position where he has to decide whether to support a partner with harmful views. But by continuing the relationship, he might be enabling that behavior. So, depending on the perspective, the author could be considered wrong for not taking a firmer stance against the racism, even if he's trying to change her. However, the situation is complex, and the answer isn't black and white. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's racism is a significant issue, and the author is aware of it, continuing the relationship could mean he's complicit. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), but there's nuance.\n"
