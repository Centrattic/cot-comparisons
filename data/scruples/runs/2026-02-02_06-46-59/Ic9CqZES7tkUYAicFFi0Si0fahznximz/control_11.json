She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves cultural context, personal relationships, and the impact of racism.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend is from Ukraine and has racist views against Black people. He's trying to change her views but faces pressure from a friend who is Black. The friend is giving an ultimatum: stop the relationship or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, supporting racism is wrong, but the question is whether he's at fault for dating someone with racist views. If the girlfriend is openly racist and he's aware, continuing the relationship could be problematic. However, he's trying to address it, which shows he's not endorsing her views. But the issue is whether he should be held responsible for her actions. If he's not a racist himself but is in a relationship with someone who is, does that make him complicit? Or is he trying to help her change?\n\nThe friend's ultimatum adds another layer. The author is being asked to choose between the friend and the girlfriend. The friend feels betrayed because of the girlfriend's racism. However, the author isn't the one being racist; he's the one trying to address it. But by not ending the relationship despite knowing her views, he might be enabling it. However, the friend's use of \"bros before hoes\" could be seen as dismissive of the author's feelings and the complexity of the situation.\n\nThe key points: The author isn't the one being racist, but he's in a relationship with someone who is. He's making efforts to change her views. The friend is reacting to her racism, which is justified, but the ultimatum might be too harsh. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not ending the relationship immediately since change is possible, but he should consider the impact of his choice on others. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether he should end the relationship. Since he's not the racist one and is trying to address the issue, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
