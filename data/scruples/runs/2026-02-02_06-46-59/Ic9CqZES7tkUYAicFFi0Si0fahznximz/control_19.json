She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with Diana, who has racist views against black people. They live in Europe, but the author's friend, who is black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points are: Diana's racism, the author's attempts to address it, and the friend's ultimatum. The author mentions that racism in Eastern Europe might be cultural, and he's tried to get her to stop expressing it around his friends and family. But his friend is now threatening to end the friendship if he continues the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is trying to support his girlfriend and address her racism, which is commendable. However, being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author's friend feels betrayed, which adds a social dimension. The author is caught between two important relationships. \n\nBut the main issue is the girlfriend's racism. The author is aware of her views and has tried to change them, but if she's unwilling to address or change her behavior, the author might be complicit by not taking a stronger stance. The friend's reaction is extreme, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase in itself, but the core issue is the girlfriend's racism. \n\nIn this case, the author is not in the wrong for trying to work on the issue, but the problem lies with the girlfriend's views and her willingness to change. If she's not open to addressing her racism, the author might need to consider the long-term implications of being in a relationship with her. However, the immediate question is whether the author is in the wrong right now. Since he's acknowledged the racism and is making efforts, he's not entirely at fault. But the answer depends on whether supporting someone with racist views is considered the wrong thing to do. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her. The friend's ultimatum is a consequence, but the author's choice to be with a racist person, even if he's trying to help, could be seen as problematic. So the answer might be A (Yes) because he's perpetuating the issue by not cutting ties, but maybe B (No) if he's making an effort. Hmm. The community often views choosing a partner's change over a friend's stance as a tough situation where the person isn't necessarily wrong for trying to help, but the girlfriend's behavior is the real issue. The answer is probably B, but I need to be careful here. The key is that the author is not the one being racist, but is in a relationship with someone who is. The question of being \"in the wrong\" would depend on whether one should date someone with racist views regardless of their other qualities. So, the answer is A (Yes), the author is in the wrong because he's choosing to be in a relationship with a racist person despite being aware of the harm it causes to his friend and others. But wait, the author is trying to get Diana to change. So maybe it's not entirely his fault? The line is blurry. The TIFU (This Is Fine, Until) structure is about the person's own actions. The author isn't the racist, but by staying with her, he's not holding her accountable enough. So the answer is A or B? I think the correct answer is A because supporting a racist partner, even if you're trying to help, can be seen as enabling their behavior, especially when the partner is unwilling to change. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author is in the wrong for not taking a stronger stand against her racism.\n"
