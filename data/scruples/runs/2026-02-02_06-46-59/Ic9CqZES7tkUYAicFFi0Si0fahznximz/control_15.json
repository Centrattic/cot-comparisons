She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. So the situation is that he's dating Diana from Ukraine, who has racist views against Black people. He's trying to get her to not express racism, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the man is wrong for being with someone who holds racist beliefs. The friend argues that by not ending the relationship, he's betraying his friend, hence the ultimatum. The man is caught between his two important relationships and is trying to navigate this.\n\nI know that racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be problematic. But the man says that in Eastern Europe, this kind of racism might be more culturally ingrained. However, he's making an effort to get his girlfriend to change her views. But the fact remains that she's expressing racist sentiments, which is harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction with the \"bros before hoes\" ultimatum seems harsh. Friends shouldn't hold ultimatums over each other's romantic choices unless there's a serious, ongoing issue. The man's friend is overstepping by demanding that he choose between his girlfriend and the friendship. That's typically seen as an ultimatum, which is a red flag.\n\nNow, the question is whether the man is in the wrong. If he's aware that his girlfriend is racist and is making efforts to address it, but hasn't taken a firm stance against her behavior, he might be complicit. However, the fact that he's trying to encourage her to change shows he's not endorsing the racism. But if the racism is still present and he's not taking a stronger stand, maybe he's enabling it by not ending the relationship. \n\nBut then again, changing someone's deeply held beliefs is difficult. If the man is doing his best to guide her, maybe that's all he can do. However, the problem is that the girlfriend is making racist remarks in front of friends and family, which is unacceptable. The man has a responsibility to stand against racism, especially if it affects others. By not ending the relationship, he might be supporting her racism, which is why his friend is upset. But the friend's ultimatum is also problematic because it's not his place to demand that.\n\nSo, the man might not be entirely in the wrong if he's genuinely trying to help his girlfriend, but he's also not taking a firm enough stance against her racism. However, the friend is overreacting with the ultimatum. The answer hinges on whether the man is responsible for his girlfriend's views. Since he can't control her beliefs, but he can choose to be in a relationship with someone who expresses racism. That's a complex ethical issue. In many cases, people are expected to not be in relationships with individuals who display harmful, prejudiced views, especially when they're aware of the impact. So the man could be in the wrong for not ending the relationship, but the friend is also in the wrong for the ultimatum.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the author (the man) is in the wrong. If he's in a relationship with a racist person and doesn't take a stand, he's complicit. By not ending it, he's allowing the racism to persist. So maybe he's in the wrong. However, if he's making efforts to change her views, perhaps he's not. It's a bit tricky. But generally, being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be seen as enabling the behavior, even if you're trying to help them. The man might not be the asshole for not ending it immediately, but he's not entirely right either. The friend's ultimatum is definitely wrong, but that doesn't make the man right. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's choosing to stay with someone who is racist despite knowing the harm it causes, and not taking a stronger stand against it, which affects his friend. But maybe the answer is B (No) because he's trying to help her. Hmm. It's a tough call. The AITA community often considers the severity of the issue. Racism is a serious issue, so enabling it by staying in the relationship could make him complicit. Therefore, he's in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since he's making efforts, maybe he's not. The answer might be B (No) if the community leans towards giving him the benefit of the doubt because he's trying to fix things. But in reality, supporting a racist partner can be problematic. So maybe A is correct.\n"
