She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend has racist views against black people, which the author is trying to address. The author's friend, who is black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's responsibility here. Dating someone who holds racist views can be problematic because it's not just about personal beliefs; it affects others and can contribute to a harmful environment. The author acknowledges that the girlfriend's racism might stem from cultural factors, but that doesn't excuse it. Everyone has a choice in how they express their beliefs, especially in relationships.\n\nThe author is trying to change their girlfriend's views, which is commendable, but it's important to recognize that someone's racism can be deeply ingrained and not easily changed. The author's friend feels betrayed, which highlights the impact of the relationship on others. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but the core issue is the girlfriend's racism.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is aware of their girlfriend's racism and continues the relationship without taking significant steps to address it, they might be complicit, even if they're trying to change her. However, the author is making an effort, which complicates things. But racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds such views can be seen as endorsing them, especially if the author doesn't confront it directly.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships are complex. The author might be in a difficult position, trying to balance their feelings for their girlfriend and their friendship. But the friend's reaction, while extreme, points to the real problem: the girlfriend's racism directly affects others. The author's decision to stay with the girlfriend despite this could be seen as prioritizing their romantic relationship over supporting a friend who is a victim of discrimination.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for continuing the relationship if they are aware of the racism and it's causing harm to others. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the core issue is the girlfriend's racism. The author's responsibility is to not support or enable racist behavior, even if it's part of the girlfriend's background. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds harmful views, despite the negative impact on others.\n"
