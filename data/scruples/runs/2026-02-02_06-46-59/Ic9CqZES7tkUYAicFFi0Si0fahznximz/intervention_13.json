She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario involves a guy who's in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl, Diana. He likes her a lot but she's racist against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, but his black friend is upset and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the friend or the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's friend is a Black person who feels betrayed. The friend's reaction is understandable because racism is a serious issue. The friend's statement about \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it downplays the severity of racism. It's not just about choosing friends over a partner; it's about respecting a friend's dignity and not supporting a racist individual who may harm others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to change his girlfriend's views. He's in the early stages of the relationship and has been making efforts to address her racism. However, just because someone is trying to change doesn't mean they aren't currently harmful. The problem is that the girlfriend is expressing racist sentiments, which can create a toxic environment for others, especially the Black friend mentioned.\n\nThe key points here are the impact of racism and the responsibility of the author. By being in a relationship with someone who is openly racist, the author might be enabling that behavior, even if he's trying to change her. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author is caught between two sides. However, the author should consider that supporting a person with racist views, even if trying to change them, can still be harmful to others in his life, particularly his Black friend.\n\nIt's also important to note that the location in Eastern Europe might influence the cultural context of racism. However, racism is a universal issue, and justifying it based on culture is not acceptable. The author's friend is right to take a stand against racism, even if the approach is harsh. The author's responsibility is to align himself with anti-racist values, which might mean distancing from someone who spreads racist views, regardless of cultural background.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because by continuing the relationship despite knowing about the racism, he's not actively opposing harmful behavior that affects his friend. His choice to stay with the girlfriend, even with efforts to change her, doesn't address the immediate harm caused to his Black friend. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
