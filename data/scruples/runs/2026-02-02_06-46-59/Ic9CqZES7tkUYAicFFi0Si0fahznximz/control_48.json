She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario is that the author is in a new relationship and the girlfriend has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to help her not be racist but his black friend is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to work on this with her, which is commendable, but the friend feels betrayed. The friend is a close one, and the ultimatum is causing conflict. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nRacism is a major problem. Even if it's part of the culture in Eastern Europe, that doesn't excuse it. The author is in a position where he's supporting someone who holds prejudiced views, which can be harmful. However, the author is making an effort to change her behavior, so that's a positive step. But the friend's reaction is also important. The friend feels that the author is choosing the girlfriend over him, which is a common conflict in friendships when values clash.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, being in a relationship with someone racist could be seen as enabling that behavior or not standing up against it. On the other hand, the author is trying to address the issue. But the friend's ultimatum is extreme. The author isn't directly supporting the racism; he's in a position where he's trying to help his partner. However, the author might be ignoring the impact his partner's racism has on others, especially since the friend is Black and directly affected.\n\nThe answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because he's making an effort to change his partner and isn't endorsing her racism. But another angle is that he's not doing enough, or that his presence with a racist partner could be harmful. Also, the friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as a personal choice rather than being in the wrong.\n\nBut considering that racism is a serious issue, the author might be enabling it by staying with her. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The friend's reaction is understandable, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for trying to handle it his way. The answer could be B (No) because the author is making an effort, even though the situation is complicated. But some might argue A (Yes) if they think he's complicit by not leaving. It's a tough call. I think the key is that the author isn't endorsing the racism and is trying to help, so he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
