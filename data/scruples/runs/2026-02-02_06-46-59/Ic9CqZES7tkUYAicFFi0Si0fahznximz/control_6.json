She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who they really like. However, Diana is described as \"kind of racist\" against Black people. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to stay with their girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views might be problematic, especially if the person in the relationship is aware of it and it affects others. The author mentions that Diana's racism includes not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The friend is Kenyan, so this is directly relevant.\n\nThe author's friend is upset, which is understandable. The friend might feel that the author is supporting a relationship with someone who holds prejudiced views, which can be hurtful. However, the author is also in a personal relationship and might be trying to work on Diana's views. The author's dad's stories suggest that this might be a cultural issue in Eastern Europe, which could be a factor, but that doesn't excuse racism.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author at fault for being in a relationship with a racist person? The author is aware of the racism and is trying to address it. But the friend is upset because the author isn't cutting the relationship off. However, the author isn't necessarily endorsing the racism; they're trying to work on it. But is that enough?\n\nOn one hand, the author might not be in the wrong because they're in a relationship and trying to address the issue. It's their personal choice to work on the problem rather than ending it immediately. On the other hand, by choosing to stay in the relationship, the author might be enabling or not taking the racism seriously enough, which could be seen as wrong, especially if the racism is causing harm or distress to others, like the friend.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. The ultimatum \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic statement in itself, as it dismisses the value of the relationship and the person's autonomy. But that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of any wrong if they're in a relationship with someone who is racist. The author is caught between two relationships and their values.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to stay with their girlfriend. The answer likely depends on whether the author is actively supporting or condoning the racism. If the author is actively trying to address the racism and not endorsing it, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the author is aware of the racism and is choosing to ignore it or not take it seriously, that could be problematic.\n\nIn summary, the author is in a difficult situation. The racism is a serious issue, but the author is attempting to work on it. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision might not be entirely wrong if they are making an effort. However, the author should be cautious about normalizing or excusing racism in the relationship. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to address the issue, but this is a nuanced situation where the lines can be blurry.\n"
