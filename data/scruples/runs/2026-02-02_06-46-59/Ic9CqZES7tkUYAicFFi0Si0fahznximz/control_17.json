She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman who exhibits racism, particularly towards Black people. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The author is trying to address the girlfriend's racism but feels caught in the middle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The girlfriend's racism is a significant problem. Racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views are expressed and affect others. The author's friend is a Black person who feels betrayed, which is understandable. The friend's reaction is strong, but it's important to validate his feelings as racism directly impacts him.\n\nThe author is trying to work on the girlfriend's behavior, which is commendable. Changing someone's racist views is a long and difficult process, and the author is aware of that. However, the girlfriend hasn't changed her behavior enough to make the author's friend comfortable. The author is caught between supporting his girlfriend and maintaining his friendship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **The girlfriend's racism**: If she's making racist remarks or holding onto prejudiced views, that's a red flag in the relationship. Even if it's cultural, it's still harmful. The author should assess whether these views are something he can accept, especially since they affect others around him.\n\n2. **The friend's ultimatum**: The friend is Black and feels directly impacted by the girlfriend's racism. His reaction, while strong, is a reaction to being marginalized. The author's decision here affects both the relationship and the friendship. However, the friend's stance is about standing against racism, which is a valid position.\n\n3. **The author's responsibility**: By being in a relationship with a racist partner, the author may inadvertently be complicit in the racism, especially if he doesn't challenge it. Supporting a partner's harmful views can be seen as endorsing them, even if the author is trying to help her change.\n\n4. **Cultural vs. personal responsibility**: While the author mentions cultural factors, personal responsibility for one's actions is crucial. The girlfriend's racism isn't just a cultural issue but a personal one that needs addressing. Cultural tolerance doesn't excuse harmful behavior.\n\n5. **The ultimatum's fairness**: The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but it's a reaction to the emotional impact of racism. The author needs to consider where his priorities lie. If the girlfriend's racism is a deal-breaker for the author, he should act on that. If not, he might lose his friend, which is a significant consequence.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being in the relationship, but he is in a morally complex situation. However, the girlfriend's racism is a serious issue that affects others. If the author continues the relationship without the girlfriend changing her views, he might be enabling the racism. The friend's reaction, while extreme, is justified in highlighting the importance of opposing racism. The author should weigh the importance of the relationship against the values of standing against racism. If he values his friendship and doesn't want to support racism, he might be in the wrong for not choosing the friend. However, the question is whether the author himself is in the wrong for being in the relationship. The girlfriend's actions are the main issue, but the author's inaction in addressing the racism could also be problematic. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he is choosing to stay with someone whose racism affects others, despite being aware of it. But it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. However, given the friend's direct impact and the author's role in not confronting the racism effectively, the author might share some responsibility.\n"
