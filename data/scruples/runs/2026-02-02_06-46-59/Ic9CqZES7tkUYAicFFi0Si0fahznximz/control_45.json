She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views against Black people. The author likes her a lot, but some of his friends, including a Black friend, are upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The author is trying to get Diana to stop being racist but hasn't succeeded yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the severity of the racism. The user mentions that Diana says she doesn't like Black people much and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The friend in question is Kenyan, so this is directly relevant. The author is trying to address it, but maybe not effectively. The question is whether the author is wrong to continue the relationship despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's culturally ingrained, it's still harmful. The fact that the author's friend is Black and is affected by this adds weight to the situation. The author is in a position where his actions (dating someone with racist views) are causing harm to his friend. The friend feels betrayed, which is understandable because the author is prioritizing the relationship over their friendship. \n\nThe author might argue that changing someone's racist views is hard and he's trying, but it's also the responsibility of the person holding the racist views to change. The author could be enabling the racism by staying in the relationship without confronting it more directly. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but the author's decision to stay with the girlfriend could be seen as prioritizing his personal relationship over the well-being of his friend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the racism is causing direct harm to his friend and the author isn't doing enough to address it, then yes, he might be. However, if he's genuinely trying and the friend is being too harsh, it's a gray area. But given the context, the author should consider that his choice to continue the relationship is perpetuating the racist behavior, even if indirectly. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), because he's in a relationship with a racist person and not taking sufficient action to address it, thus supporting the harmful views.\n"
