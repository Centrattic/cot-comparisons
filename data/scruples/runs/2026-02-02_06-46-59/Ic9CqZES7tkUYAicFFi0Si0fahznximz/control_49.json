She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being racist towards Black people, specifically mentioning she doesn't like them much and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The author is facing pressure from a friend, who is Black, to choose between the girlfriend and the friendship, leading to an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue, and allowing it to persist in a relationship can have negative consequences. The girlfriend's behavior, even if she doesn't act on it beyond words, is harmful. The author is trying to address it by asking her to stop, but she hasn't changed. The friend's reaction is understandable given the personal offense taken, especially as he's part of the group being targeted.\n\nThe author might not be a racist himself, but by continuing the relationship despite her racist views, he could be enabling that behavior. The fact that his friend is Kenyan and directly affected adds weight to the situation. The cultural argument about Eastern Europe's potential racism doesn't excuse her actions. The author's responsibility here might extend beyond just his own feelings; he's now part of a relationship that includes interactions with others who might be harmed.\n\nThe key points are whether the author is complicit by staying with her despite her racism, and if he's failing to address it effectively. The ultimatum from the friend highlights the conflict between loyalty to a friend and a romantic partner. However, the core issue is the girlfriend's racism. If the author values his friend's well-being and the principles of equality, continuing the relationship could be seen as supporting her views indirectly.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if he continues the relationship without addressing her racism more decisively. His current approach of trying to change her isn't working, so staying could perpetuate the problem. The friend's ultimatum, while harsh, stems from a place of being directly affected. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's maintaining a relationship with someone who holds harmful views, which can be seen as complicity.\n"
