She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The main points here are about racism, personal relationships, and the conflict between friends.\n\nFirst, the person's girlfriend is racist against Black people. Even though they live in Europe and the user mentions it's a cultural issue from Eastern Europe, racism is still a serious problem. The user is trying to address this by encouraging their girlfriend to not express racist views in front of their friends and family. That's a good step, as it shows they're aware of the issue and trying to mitigate it.\n\nBut the key issue is the girlfriend's racist statements. The user's black friend is upset and giving an ultimatum, which is a significant problem. The friend's reaction is understandable because being called a racist is hurtful, especially when it's directed at their identity. The user is caught between two people they care about, which is tough.\n\nThe user might not be directly racist themselves, but they are in a relationship with someone who is. Supporting a partner's racist views, even if they're trying to change, could still be problematic. The girlfriend's comments are harmful, and the friend's reaction highlights the importance of standing against racism. If the user continues the relationship despite these issues, they might be seen as condoning her racism, which is a big problem.\n\nAlso, the user says that curing racism isn't simple because they've done it before. That part is confusing. Maybe they meant they've tried to address it in the past? But regardless, the fact remains that the girlfriend is making racist remarks, which is unacceptable. The user might need to consider whether they can handle the ongoing conflicts and if the relationship is healthy, especially with the ultimatum from their friend.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't directly in the wrong for dating her, but they should definitely address the racism. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer might be more about their actions. Since the girlfriend is racist and the user is continuing the relationship despite the friend's hurt, it's possible the user is enabling the racism. So, the answer might be A (Yes), because they're in a relationship with a racist person and not taking a stronger stance against it.\n"
