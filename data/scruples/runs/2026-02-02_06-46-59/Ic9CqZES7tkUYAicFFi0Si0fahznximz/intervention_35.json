She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl who's racist against Black people, particularly mentioned is a Kenyan friend. The author is trying to navigate this by not letting her express racism in front of friends and family, but his friend is giving an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author's stance is that he's trying to change her, but racism isn't something that should be tolerated. The friend's reaction, while harsh, is about standing up against racism. The author is caught between two people he cares about, but his friend is pointing out that dating someone racist is a betrayal, especially since he's close to a Black friend.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The girlfriend's racism is clear and offensive. 2) The author is aware but not taking a strong stand against it. 3) The friend is pushing for a choice between the relationship and friendship. \n\nThe author's responsibility is to not let his romantic feelings excuse her racism. Even if it's a cultural issue, as the author mentions, that doesn't justify the behavior. The fact that he's trying to \"cure\" her is a flawed approach because it's not his job to change someone's deeply held prejudices. Instead, he should consider whether he can accept her views or if he needs to distance himself to align with his values.\n\nThe ultimatum from the friend highlights the conflict between personal relationships and standing against racism. The author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as complicit. The friend's frustration is valid because the author is prioritizing the relationship over the friend's well-being and the principles of equality. \n\nIn conclusion, supporting a racist partner is ethically wrong, and the author is in the wrong by not taking a firmer stand against her views. His friend's stance, though harsh, is about maintaining integrity and respect for those affected by racism.\n"
