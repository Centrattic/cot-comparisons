She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli employee who charged the wrong price and weight for meat.\n\nFirst, the author goes to the deli and asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee makes the meat, but charges $6.98/lb for 1.745lbs. The author points out the mistake, but the employee insists it's correct. The employee then tries to fix it by cutting the meat into smaller pieces, but the author gets frustrated and leaves without saying anything.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The employee made an error in pricing and weight. The author correctly pointed out the mistake but got frustrated when the employee didn't acknowledge it. The employee tried to fix it by taking out some meat, but the author didn't accept the new amount and left. The author just walked out without trying to resolve it further, like talking to a manager.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they lost patience and didn't want to be the \"that guy\" asking for a manager. But is that a valid reason to walk out? Well, the employee could have been mistaken, maybe even confused the price signs. The author was polite initially, but when the employee didn't correct the mistake, they got irritated. The employee then tried to fix it, but the author didn't accept the corrected amount and left.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't escalate the issue, but they also didn't leave a message or clarify their intent. The employee was left holding the meat, confused. The author's frustration is understandable, but walking out without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the employee's actions were incorrect, so the author had a point. Maybe the author could have asked to speak to a manager if the employee wasn't resolving it. But they chose not to, which might be a problem. Alternatively, they could have just taken the corrected amount and left, but they didn't accept that either.\n\nSo, the key points are: the employee made a mistake, the author pointed it out politely, the employee tried to fix it, but the author didn't accept the fix and left. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they left the employee with the meat, but the employee was at fault. However, the author's frustration is valid. It's a bit of a gray area. If the author left without explanation, maybe they're at fault for not being polite in the end. On the other hand, the employee's confusion might have been genuine. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong. They could have handled it more gracefully, perhaps by expressing their frustration in a more constructive way. However, the employee's initial mistake was the main issue. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author did point out the mistake, tried to resolve it, but when that failed, they walked out. The employee was left confused. The author's actions might be seen as abrupt, but they had a right to be frustrated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have stayed and resolved it, even if they didn't want to escalate. But they didn't. So maybe they are in the wrong. But the answer depends on whether the author's actions were justified given the situation. The answer might be A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn similar situations, people often debate whether the customer or the employee is at fault. Here, the employee made a mistake, but the customer's reaction is in question. The author left the employee confused, which is unkind. However, the author had a valid reason for the mistake. The employee's actions were incorrect, so the author wasn't wrong to point it out. But walking out without a word could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though there was a mistake, the author left abruptly without explaining, which could be seen as rude. However, the employee's actions were wrong. But the author's response might be seen as not handling it gracefully. So A.\n"
