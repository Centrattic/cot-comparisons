She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli where there's a price discrepancy and the employee's handling of it caused the customer to leave without saying a word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The customer asked for 1 lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee corrected it by removing meat, but the customer left without further interaction.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know. So, I need to assess both sides. \n\nFrom the customer's perspective: They asked for a specific weight and price. The employee initially said it's okay if it's a little over, but then charged them almost double the rate. The customer politely pointed out the error. The employee's response was dismissive, leading to the customer losing patience. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, just left.\n\nFrom the employee's perspective: The price had increased, but the sign wasn't updated. They might have been trying to adjust the amount to match the new price. However, the way they handled it\u2014arguing about the weight and then taking out the meat and reweighing it\u2014could be seen as defensive or unprofessional.\n\nThe customer's actions: Leaving without saying a word might be seen as rude, as they didn't address the issue further or inform the employee. However, the employee's behavior was also unprofessional, which could justify the customer's frustration.\n\nIs the customer in the wrong? If they were polite, tried to resolve it, but the employee was uncooperative, then the customer's reaction might be understandable. However, walking away without any communication could be seen as a lack of responsibility to resolve the issue. But maybe they just wanted to avoid conflict.\n\nThe key factors are: Did the customer have a valid reason to leave? The employee made a mistake in pricing, and the customer pointed it out. The employee's response was poor. The customer's response was abrupt. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The customer might not be in the wrong because the employee was at fault for the pricing error. However, the customer left without trying to resolve it further, which could be seen as rude. But considering the employee's unprofessional behavior, maybe the customer's reaction is justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the employee was primarily at fault, and the customer's frustration is understandable. However, if the customer should have at least spoken to a manager, then maybe A. But the story says the customer didn't want to be that guy, so they left. \n\nIn many similar situations, the customer is expected to resolve the issue, even if the employee is wrong. So, by leaving without addressing it, the customer might be in the wrong for not trying to resolve it properly. On the other hand, if the employee was clearly wrong and uncooperative, the customer's actions are more defensible. \n\nI think the answer is B. The customer was correct in pointing out the mistake, and the employee was in the wrong. The customer's frustration is valid, but leaving without words might be rude. However, the main fault lies with the employee. So, the customer is not in the wrong.\n"
