She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee made a mistake, charged them $6.98/lb for 1.745lbs. The customer pointed out the error, the employee tried to fix it by taking out slices, but the customer got frustrated and left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the employee's mistake is clear. They charged the wrong price and gave more weight than requested. The customer was polite when pointing out the issue. The employee's response was dismissive and maybe not helpful, taking out the meat and trying to adjust it in a way that might not have been correct. The customer lost patience and left. \n\nNow, is the customer in the wrong for leaving abruptly? Well, they didn't confront the employee further, didn't ask to speak to a manager. They wanted to avoid conflict. The employee made an error, and the customer wasn't being rude beyond expressing irritation. The customer's action of leaving without a word might be seen as rude, but given the situation, maybe they just wanted to cut their losses. \n\nBut the key points are: Did the customer handle it in a reasonable way? They did point out the mistake, the employee tried to fix it but maybe not correctly. The customer might have been right to leave if they felt it was a losing battle. However, leaving without saying anything could be seen as abrupt. But considering the employee's actions, maybe the customer had enough. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then the customer should have handled it differently, maybe waited for a resolution. If B (no), then the customer's frustration is justified, and leaving wasn't wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is the employee's error and their handling of it. The customer's frustration is understandable. Leaving without a word is impolite, but given the circumstances, maybe it's excusable. The answer might lean towards B because the employee was at fault. However, the customer could have politely asked for a correct price or just paid the correct amount and left. But in the situation, the customer was overwhelmed and left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer should have stayed and resolved it properly. But the employee was already trying to fix it. The customer might have been in the right to leave if they felt it was too much. The answer could be B, not the customer's fault.\n"
