She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter mishap. Let's go through the details.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1 lb of oven-roasted turkey meat at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The employee made a mistake, charging $6.98/lb instead. The customer noticed and pointed it out. The employee tried to explain the price change, then when the weight was wrong, the employee rebagged the meat improperly. The customer became irritated and left without speaking to a manager.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the customer handle this situation appropriately? The employee made errors, but the customer walked out. The customer was polite initially but lost patience. The employee's mistake cost the customer more money. The customer didn't escalate the issue, which might be understandable if they were frustrated. But leaving the employee confused might be seen as rude. However, the employee's actions could be the main issue here. The customer's right to get what they paid for is important. The employee's poor handling of the situation might justify the customer's reaction. But did the customer owe the employee an explanation or at least a word? The customer left the meat and walked out. That's abrupt. But maybe given the employee's mistakes, it's understandable. The customer's frustration is valid. So, is the customer the asshole? It's a judgment call. The customer had a right to be upset about overcharging and incorrect weight. The employee's actions were unprofessional. However, the customer could have asked for a manager instead. But the customer didn't want to be \"that guy.\" Still, leaving the employee in the lurch might be inconsiderate. But given the circumstances, maybe the customer's actions are justified. So answer B, the customer isn't in the wrong.\n"
