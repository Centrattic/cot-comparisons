She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (who wrote the story) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl in a confused state without saying a word. The situation involves a pricing discrepancy and some back-and-forth.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had gone up but hadn't updated the sign. Then the customer mentioned the weight was over a pound, and the employee tried to fix it by taking out meat. The author got frustrated and left without finishing the transaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The employee made a mistake in the price and weight. The customer tried to correct it politely. The employee's response that the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated might be a problem if it's true. But the customer is being charged more than they expected. \n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable because they were misled. However, leaving without resolving the issue might be seen as abrupt. But considering the employee's actions\u2014arguing about the weight, not clearly explaining the price change, and then trying to repackage the meat by tearing slices\u2014could have added to the customer's irritation. \n\nThe key points are: Did the customer have a right to leave? If the employee was not resolving the issue correctly, the customer might feel justified in leaving. However, not speaking to the manager or clarifying could be seen as not giving the store a chance to fix the problem. But the customer also mentioned not wanting to be the \"Can I speak to your manager?\" guy, indicating they didn't want to escalate it. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee's mistake and the customer's reaction are both part of the scenario. The customer's actions might be seen as impolite because they left abruptly, but their frustration is valid due to being overcharged. So, is the customer in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the store was indeed overcharging due to an error, the customer isn't wrong for not wanting to pay more. However, leaving without resolving or at least a clear communication could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut looking at the situation from the customer's perspective, they were trying to get a fair price and were met with confusion and possibly incorrect handling by the employee. The customer's decision to leave might be seen as a reasonable reaction to prevent being overcharged, even if the method was abrupt. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, the customer didn't address the issue properly, so maybe it's A. \n\nWait, but the employee admitted the price had gone up, so maybe the sign was incorrect. If that's the case, the customer was right to point out the weight, and the employee's actions in re-slicing were not resolving the issue. The customer might have felt that further interaction would be pointless if the employee was not handling it correctly. So maybe the customer isn't in the wrong.\n"
