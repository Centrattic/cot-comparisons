She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) was wrong to leave the deli counter after an incident with the employee. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, and after the author pointed out the higher price, the employee said the price had increased. Then, the author noticed the weight was over 1.7lbs, so they pointed that out too. The employee tried to adjust the weight by removing slices, but the author walked out.\n\nSo, the key points here are the price discrepancy and the overage in weight. The employee admitted the price had gone up, which might be an error in signage. The weight issue is the author being charged for 1.745lbs when they asked for 1lb. The employee tried to fix it by taking out meat, but the author left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: They tried to politely point out the errors, got into a back-and-forth with the employee, and then left without addressing it further. The user is wondering if that's inconsiderate or if the author had a right to leave.\n\nThe employee might have been making a mistake, either with the price or the weight. The author's frustration is understandable, but walking out without resolving the issue could leave the employee confused or in a difficult position. However, the author might have felt that the employee wasn't handling it correctly, so leaving to avoid confrontation could be seen as their right.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store might be at fault for the pricing error, but the employee was trying to fix the weight. The author's irritation led them to leave, but not necessarily in a way that's their fault. The question is whether they had an obligation to wait for a resolution. Since they already pointed out the issues, maybe they weren't wrong to leave if the employee wasn't resolving it satisfactorily.\n\nOn the other hand, walking out without a word might be considered rude if the employee was genuinely trying to correct things. But given the employee's confusion and the author's frustration, it's a bit of a gray area. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author tried to address the issues and left without escalating further, which could be seen as reasonable under stress.\n"
