She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter in frustration. \n\nFirst, the situation: The customer ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave him 1.745lbs but priced it at $6.98/lb, which is almost triple the expected price. The customer points out the error, but the employee insists the price has increased without updating the sign. The customer then gets increasingly frustrated when the employee takes the order back, starts reweighing, and cuts the meat into slices. The customer leaves without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, the key points. The employee made an error in pricing, charging the higher rate without the customer's knowledge. The customer is trying to correct the mistake but is met with what seems like defensiveness. The employee's actions of taking the order back, reweighing, and cutting the meat might have been an attempt to fix the error, but the method was confusing and possibly incorrect. The customer's frustration is understandable given the price discrepancy and the employee's handling.\n\nThe author's actions: They left without saying a word, not even to the manager. The question is whether this is justified. The customer's patience was lost, which is a common reaction in stressful situations. However, not speaking to the manager might have been a mistake, as that could have resolved the issue. But the customer didn't want to escalate, so they left instead.\n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the employee should have handled the situation better\u2014apologized, corrected the error, and offered a refund for the overcharge. The customer's right to question the pricing is valid. The author's choice to leave might be impulsive, but it's not necessarily wrong. The employee's actions contributed to the problem, so the blame isn't entirely on the customer. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
