She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left in frustration after an employee made a pricing mistake.\n\nFirst, let's recap the key points. The customer asked for 1 pound of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 pounds but charged $6.98 per pound, leading to a total of $12.18. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee tried to fix it by taking out the meat, but the way she handled it (only putting 2 slices plus half another) seemed to the customer like she was being inconsiderate or not properly addressing the issue. The customer then left without saying anything else.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The customer was polite initially when pointing out the mistake. The employee's response that the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated could be a valid explanation, but the customer is right to question the weight as well\u2014they asked for 1 pound, but got almost double. The employee's actions in rebagging the meat by taking out slices and tearing one in half might come off as dismissive or not taking the customer's concerns seriously. The customer felt the employee was not addressing their issue properly, so they left. \n\nThe question is whether the customer was wrong to leave without further action. The customer didn't confront the employee further or ask to speak to a manager, instead just walking out. However, given that the employee's response was incorrect (the price was supposed to be $3.98, not $6.98), the customer is justified in pointing out the mistake. The employee's handling of the situation might have been poor, leading to the customer losing patience. \n\nFrom a customer service perspective, mistakes happen, and employees might make errors. But when a customer brings up a mistake, the employee should correct it properly. In this case, the employee charged the wrong price and then tried to adjust the weight, but it seems like she didn't actually fix the pricing issue. The customer, frustrated by the employee's incorrect handling, decided to leave. \n\nThe customer's actions could be seen as justified because they were dealing with a mistake in pricing and weight, and the employee's response was inadequate. Walking out might be seen as impolite, but given the situation and the employee's behavior, it's understandable. The customer wasn't aggressive or abusive; they just left when they realized the employee wasn't addressing their concerns properly. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the customer should have stayed and insisted on speaking to a manager to resolve the issue. However, the customer's decision to leave could be seen as a result of frustration with the employee's inability to handle the situation correctly. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee made a mistake in pricing and then handled the correction poorly. The customer was correct to point out the mistake and was reasonable in their response. Leaving might not be the ideal way to handle it, but in the heat of the moment and given the employee's behavior, the customer's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
