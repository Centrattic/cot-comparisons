She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The person goes to the deli, orders a pound of turkey meat. The employee makes a mistake in pricing, charging $6.98 per pound instead of $3.98. The customer points out the error, and the employee tries to correct the weight but seems confused. The customer gets frustrated, walks out without completing the transaction.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The key points are the employee's mistake in pricing, the customer noticing and trying to correct it, and the customer's decision to leave. The customer was polite initially, but the employee's confusion and incorrect actions (like taking out meat and trying to rebag it) likely led to the customer's irritation. The customer didn't confront the manager but chose to leave, which might be seen as avoiding conflict, but was also a personal choice to not deal with the situation further.\n\nThe question is if the customer is in the wrong. The employee made a pricing error, which is on the store. The customer tried to address it but became frustrated. Walking out might be seen as a way to avoid further conflict, which isn't necessarily wrong. The customer isn't responsible for the employee's mistake. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
