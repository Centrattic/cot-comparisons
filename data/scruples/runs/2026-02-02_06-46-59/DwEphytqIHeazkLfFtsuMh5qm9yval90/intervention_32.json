She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) was wrong in walking out on the deli girl without saying anything.\n\nSo, the situation: The author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but the deli employee charges $6.98/lb and gives almost two pounds. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, the author is upset because the weight is over a pound, the employee checks and rebags it to what seems like a very small amount. The author then leaves without further interaction.\n\nFirst, the employee made an error in pricing. The author correctly pointed out the mistake. The employee then tried to correct the weight, but the author seems to be upset about the small amount. However, the original request was for 1lb, and the employee provided almost 1.75 pounds at the higher price. When the author questions it, the employee corrects it by taking out meat to make it the correct weight. But the author, now irritated, just leaves.\n\nNow, the key points: The author was correct in pointing out the mistake. The employee tried to adjust, but maybe not effectively. The author's reaction was to leave abruptly. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nThe author's actions: They left without resolving the issue, didn't speak to a manager, and walked out. However, they were correct in identifying the price discrepancy. The employee's actions might have been confusing or incorrect. The author's reaction, while abrupt, might be due to frustration with the employee's handling of the situation. \n\nPossible angles: Was the author wrong to leave? Or was the employee's behavior the main issue? The author's tone suggests they were upset, but their initial complaint was valid. The employee might have been defensive or not helpful, leading to the author's impatience. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author had a valid reason to question the price and weight. The employee's response might have been inadequate, leading to the author's decision to leave. However, not following up by speaking to a manager could be seen as the author not fully resolving the issue. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, it's about whether their actions (leaving) were inappropriate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and whether the person had a right to be upset. The author's main issue was the incorrect charge and the confusion from the employee. The author's reaction, while maybe abrupt, might be justified given the frustration. The employee's behavior (defensive, maybe not properly trained) could be the bigger issue. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's actions were a result of a service mistake and the employee's unhelpful response, leading to the author's frustration and decision to leave. The author isn't necessarily wrong for walking out in that situation, especially if they felt the employee wasn't adequately addressing the problem.\n"
