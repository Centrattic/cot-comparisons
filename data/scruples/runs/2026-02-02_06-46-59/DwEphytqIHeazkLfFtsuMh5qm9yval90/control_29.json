She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli to buy turkey meat. The price was listed as $3.98 per pound. They asked for a pound, so they expected around $4. But the employee gave them two pounds (1.745 lbs) at the wrong price of $6.98/lb, totaling $12.18. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee explained the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author then questioned the weight, as they had asked for a pound but got almost two. The employee then tried to correct the weight by taking out more meat and rebagging it. The author got frustrated and left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? Let's break it down. The employee made a pricing error. The author noticed and tried to correct it. The employee then tried to adjust the weight instead of the price. The author became irritated and left. \n\nIn a retail setting, customers expect accurate pricing. When a mistake occurs, it's the employee's responsibility to correct it. The employee here changed the weight instead of adjusting the price, which seems incorrect because the price had actually increased. The author's frustration is understandable because they were being overcharged. However, the employee might have been following company policy or making an honest mistake. \n\nThe author didn't escalate by asking to speak to a manager, which could have resolved the issue. Walking out might have left the employee confused, but the author had every right to be concerned about being overcharged. The employee's approach to adjust the weight instead of the price was incorrect, so the author's irritation was justified. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here because the employee made the error, and the author was trying to address a legitimate concern. The author's actions, though abrupt, were a response to being overcharged. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
