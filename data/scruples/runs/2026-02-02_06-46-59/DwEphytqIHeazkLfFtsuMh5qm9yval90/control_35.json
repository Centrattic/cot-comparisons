She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter where the customer ends up leaving without resolving the issue. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the customer went to buy some turkey meat. They asked for 1lb at $3.98 per pound. The deli girl made it with slices that were too thin, but the customer agreed to the overage. Then, when the total came out to $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound, the customer noticed the price discrepancy. The deli employee says the price has increased but the sign hasn't been updated. \n\nThe customer points out the weight is over a pound, but the employee starts rebagging the meat by taking out slices, even tearing one in half to make the weight come out. The customer then leaves without saying anything else, feeling irritated. The question is whether the customer is the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nNow, considering the employee's actions: she might have made a pricing error. The customer is correct in pointing out the weight was over a pound, which they agreed to. However, the price per pound was higher than advertised. The employee's response that the price went up but the sign wasn't changed seems like an error on the store's part. \n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable. When the employee starts rebagging the meat in a way that seems unprofessional (tearing slices in half), the customer loses patience and leaves. The key point is whether the customer should have handled it differently. \n\nThe customer did try to address the issue politely, but when the employee didn't resolve it correctly, they left. The question is if leaving abruptly without seeking a manager is wrong. Some might say the customer should have asked to speak to the manager to get a resolution. Others might argue that after the employee's behavior, the customer had the right to walk out, especially if they didn't want to escalate the situation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the store made a pricing error, and the employee handled the correction poorly. The customer's main issue was the incorrect pricing and the employee's unprofessional handling. Walking out might be seen as a reasonable reaction if the customer felt they couldn't trust the employee to correct the mistake properly. However, not following up might leave the issue unresolved, but the customer might not want to deal with the hassle. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the customer had an obligation to stay and fight for a resolution or if they were justified in leaving after the employee's actions. Since the customer was the victim of the store's error, they might not be in the wrong for leaving out of frustration, especially if they didn't want to escalate to management. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
