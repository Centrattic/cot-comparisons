She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person went to the deli and ordered a pound of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 pounds but charged them at $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to justify the higher price by saying the sign wasn't updated. The customer then got frustrated when the employee didn't immediately correct the issue and left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The customer correctly pointed out the discrepancy. The employee's response was dismissive, which probably escalated the situation. The customer was being patient initially but lost patience when the employee didn't resolve the issue. Walking out without paying the correct amount could be seen as wrong because the correct price wasn't paid. However, the employee was at fault for the mistake and the poor handling of the customer's concern. The customer might have had the right to question the charge but leaving without addressing it could be problematic. The key is whether the customer intended to pay the correct amount. If they didn't, that's an issue. But if they were just frustrated and left to avoid confrontation, maybe not. The employee's actions also contributed to the situation. So the answer might be B, the customer isn't in the wrong because the employee made the mistake and handled it poorly, leading to the customer's frustration.\n"
