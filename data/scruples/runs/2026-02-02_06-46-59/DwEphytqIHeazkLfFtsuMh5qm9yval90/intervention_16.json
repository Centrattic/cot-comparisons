She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli where the author ordered turkey meat, expecting a certain price and weight, but the employee messed up the pricing and weight.\n\nFirst, the employee messed up the price. The author asked for $3.98/lb but the total came out to $6.98/lb. Also, the weight was over 1.7 pounds, which is more than the 1lb the author ordered. The employee tried to justify the weight by saying they asked if it was okay if it was a little over. But the author points out that the employee didn't check the weight before giving the total. Then, when the author pointed out the issues, the employee started cutting slices and trying to rebag it, but the author just left.\n\nThe author is defensive, saying they didn't want to be \"that guy\" who asks for the manager. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. So, what's the right call here?\n\nThe employee made a mistake in both price and weight. The author caught the mistake and tried to correct it politely. The employee then tried to fix it by reducing the amount, but the author left. The author didn't escalate the situation by asking for management, but they also didn't leave the issue unresolved. They just walked out. \n\nIs the author wrong for not dealing with the situation? Well, the employee was incorrect in their actions. The author had every right to question the mistake. However, walking out without addressing it fully might leave the employee confused. But considering the author's irritation and the employee's confusion, maybe the author's reaction is understandable. They might not be in the wrong for not dealing with a clearly confused employee, especially if the main goal was to get the correct product and the author was done with the interaction. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say the author should have at least spoken to a manager to correct the mistake. But the author's reasoning is that they didn't want to be confrontational. So, in this case, the author's actions were to protect their own patience and not escalate, but maybe they should have followed up. However, given the confusion and the employee's own mistakes, perhaps the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to leave given the employee's errors and inability to resolve the issue properly.\n"
