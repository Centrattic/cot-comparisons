She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. So, first, I need to go through the situation step by step.\n\nThe author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The girl slices it, asks if it's okay if it's a bit over. The author agrees, but then the bill comes out to $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The author points out the mistake, the girl says the price went up but didn't update the sign. The author is confused about the weight being over a pound and the price being higher. The girl then takes the meat back, starts taking slices, cutting them, and trying to rebag. The author gets irritated, puts the basket down, and leaves without saying anything.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the price discrepancy and the weight discrepancy. The author ordered at a specific price per pound, but the actual price was higher. The girl's explanation is that the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. That's a problem. Then the weight was over a pound, which the girl had asked if that's okay. The author points out the weight, and the girl seems to not realize the mistake.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because they were overcharged and given more product than requested. The girl's mistake was making the price higher than the posted price and not correctly handling the weight. When the author confronts her, she tries to fix it by cutting the meat, which is a poor solution. The author leaves in frustration.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was trying to correct the mistake. The deli employee made errors in pricing and weight. The author's reaction was to leave without finishing the interaction. The question is whether that's being an asshole. The author didn't escalate the situation to the manager, which is a valid step, but they were within their right to point out the errors. Walking out without resolving it might be seen as not giving the employee a chance to correct it properly. However, the employee was already making mistakes, and the author might feel that dealing with it further was pointless. The author's options were to either take the time to resolve it or leave. Since the employee was already confused, the author's decision to leave might be justified as not wanting to engage further. But the etiquette might suggest staying and asking for a manager if the employee can't handle it. However, the author mentions they didn't want to be \"that guy\" asking for the manager, so they left. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were correct in pointing out the errors. The store made a mistake, and the employee wasn't handling it well. The author's frustration is valid. However, leaving without resolving it could be seen as not giving the store a chance to fix things. But considering the employee's confusion and the author's irritation, maybe it's a reasonable reaction. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
