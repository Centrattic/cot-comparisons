She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where there was a pricing discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the user went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee made a mistake, charged them $6.98 per pound for 1.745 lbs. The user pointed out the mistake. The employee tried to justify it, saying the price had gone up but the sign wasn't changed. The user got irritated when the employee didn't acknowledge the weight being over a pound. Then the employee tried to rebag it, cutting slices to make it weigh less. The user left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the user is in the wrong for leaving without resolving the issue. \n\nThe user's actions: they tried to point out the mistake politely. The employee was unhelpful and maybe even tried to shortchange them by cutting the meat. The user became frustrated and left. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the employee was at fault for the pricing error and not handling the customer's concern properly. The user had the right to question the price and the weight. However, leaving without saying anything might be considered abrupt. But given the employee's behavior, maybe the user's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn many cases, customers are expected to handle such issues by escalating to a manager. But the user didn't want to cause a scene. The key here is whether the user was wrong for not trying to resolve it further. \n\nThe employee's actions were unprofessional. The user's reaction, while abrupt, was a response to poor service. So the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
