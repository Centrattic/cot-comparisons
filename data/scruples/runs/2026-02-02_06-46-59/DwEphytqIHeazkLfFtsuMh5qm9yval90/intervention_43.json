She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word.\n\nSo, the situation: The author went to the deli and asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee initially sliced it, asked if it's okay if it's a bit over, and the author agreed. Then the author notices the price is $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but didn't update the sign. The author insists on the weight, the employee challenges where the weight is mentioned, becomes irritated, the employee starts rebagging with 2 slices and a half of another, leading the author to leave without a word.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The sign was incorrect, leading to the customer being charged more. The customer politely pointed out the mistake. The employee then tried to correct the weight by removing meat, but the method seemed haphazard (using 2 slices and tearing another), which might have made the customer feel disrespected or that the employee wasn't taking it seriously. \n\nThe author's reaction was to leave without saying a word, not finish the transaction. The author claims they were irritated and didn't want to escalate by asking to speak to a manager. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee made a mistake, the customer tried to correct it. The employee's response may have been unprofessional. However, the customer left without completing the transaction. The question is whether the author had a right to walk out. \n\nIn customer service scenarios, customers often have the right to correct pricing errors. If the employee was being dismissive or incorrect, the customer might be justified in walking out, especially if they felt disrespected. But the author did leave without trying to resolve it further (like speaking to a manager or refusing the incorrect charge). \n\nHowever, the author did point out the mistake and the employee tried to fix it, but the method was unsatisfactory. The author's final action was to leave, which is their right. But in terms of being in the wrong, perhaps the employee was at fault for the pricing error and the handling of it. The author's irritation is understandable given the situation. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the employee confused. The employee was confused because the customer left without a word. But the author's frustration might have been justified. So the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the employee made a mistake and the handling was poor, so the author's action was a reaction to that.\n"
