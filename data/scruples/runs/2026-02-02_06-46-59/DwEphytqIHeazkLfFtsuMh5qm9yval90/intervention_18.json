She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left the employee confused and walked out without finishing the transaction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer noticed the price discrepancy and pointed it out. The employee explained the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, and the employee tried to fix it by rebagging with fewer slices. The customer then left without finishing the transaction.\n\nNow, considering the customer's actions. They did point out the mistake politely initially. The employee's response that the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated might be confusing. The customer then noticed the weight was over a pound, which they had agreed to be okay if it was a little over. The employee tried to adjust the weight, but the customer became irritated and left without finishing. The key here is whether the customer handled it appropriately.\n\nThe customer's main issue seems to be with the higher price and the weight being more than a pound. They had agreed to a \"little over,\" but the employee charged for 1.745lbs. The customer might feel they were overcharged. However, the employee made a mistake in applying the correct price. The customer's reaction was to walk out, which might be seen as abrupt. They didn't ask to speak to a manager or resolve the issue further. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the employee made an error in pricing and possibly in the weight. The customer brought it up, which is the right thing to do. However, when the employee tried to correct the weight, the customer decided to leave. The customer didn't finish the transaction, which might leave the employee with an incomplete order. But the customer's frustration is understandable given the confusion and overcharge. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? They did try to address the issue. The employee might have been negligent in updating the price and accurately measuring the weight. However, the customer's exit left the employee with a partial transaction. But given the situation, the customer's frustration is justified, and walking out might not be the best approach, but it's not necessarily wrong. \n\nThe employee's response that the price had changed but the sign wasn't updated is a bit of an excuse. The customer's reaction to the weight being over a pound and the incorrect pricing led to a breakdown in communication. The customer, while frustrated, did try to address the issue. The employee's actions in rebagging might not have resolved the customer's concerns about the price discrepancy. \n\nIn conclusion, the customer is not in the wrong. The employee made mistakes, and while the customer's exit was abrupt, it's a reaction to being overcharged and not being properly addressed beyond the initial correction attempts. The customer's actions are a result of frustration and trying to avoid further conflict. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
