She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after an argument over pricing and weight.\n\nFirst, the situation: The AITA went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The AITA points out the mistake, and the employee says the price has increased but the sign wasn't updated. The AITA then notes the weight is more than a pound. The employee checks and starts rebagging by cutting slices, leading the AITA to leave without a word.\n\nNow, the key points here. The AITA was polite in pointing out the discrepancies. The employee made a mistake, possibly due to not updating the price sign. The AITA tried to resolve it, but the employee's method of rebagging (cutting slices) might have been time-consuming or unprofessional. The AITA lost patience and left, not saying goodbye.\n\nIs the AITA in the wrong? Well, the employee made an error. The AITA was trying to get a correct amount and price. They were polite but eventually left when the employee didn't handle it smoothly. The AITA didn't escalate it to a manager, which they considered but didn't want to do. The main question is whether leaving without a word was wrong.\n\nIn similar situations, people might get frustrated with poor customer service. The AITA's decision to leave could be seen as justified if the employee wasn't helpful. However, not saying anything might be considered rude. But given the context of the employee's unprofessional response, maybe it's understandable. The AITA didn't cause harm; they just left. The employee was the one who made the mistake. So, the AITA isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
