She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl with the meat without saying anything. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, the employee claimed the price had gone up but didn't change the sign. Then the author pointed out the weight was more than a pound, the employee asked where it said that. The author got irritated, the employee tried to rebag it by taking some slices and cutting one in half. Then the author just walked out.\n\nSo, the key points here: the employee made a pricing error and possibly a weight error. The author tried to correct them politely but the employee was dismissive. The author's patience wore thin, and they left without finishing the transaction.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee made a mistake in both price and weight. The author tried to communicate the error and was met with confusion or deflection. The author's frustration is understandable. Walking out might be impulsive, but given the employee's unhelpfulness, maybe it's a reasonable reaction. However, the author didn't resolve the issue and left the employee with the meat. But the employee was incorrect in their actions, so the author isn't entirely at fault. The employee should have corrected the mistake immediately. The author's action, while abrupt, might be justified given the situation. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
