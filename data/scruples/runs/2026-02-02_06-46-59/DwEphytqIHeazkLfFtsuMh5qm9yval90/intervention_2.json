She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving a confused deli employee without explaining the issue.\n\nFirst, the situation: The customer ordered 1 lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee initially denied it but then corrected the weight. The customer got frustrated with the employee's handling and left without paying, even though the employee tried to fix it.\n\nThe key points here are the customer's actions. When the employee corrected the weight, they gave the customer a second bag that was properly weighed. The customer took the new bag, which was 1.009 lbs and priced correctly. But instead of paying for the correct amount, the customer left without paying, even after the issue was resolved. \n\nNow, the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. The customer's frustration is understandable because they were overcharged initially and had to deal with a confusing situation. However, once the employee corrected the mistake and provided the correct amount at the right price, the customer should have proceeded to pay for the corrected item. By leaving without paying, the customer is essentially stealing the correctly priced meat. \n\nEven if the customer was irritated, the appropriate action would have been to either pay the correct amount or return the item and leave. Taking the item without paying is not acceptable, regardless of the frustration. The author's choice to walk out without paying makes them responsible for the item's cost, hence being in the wrong.\n"
