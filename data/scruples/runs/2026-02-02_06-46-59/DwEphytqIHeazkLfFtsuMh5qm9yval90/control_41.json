She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli where the customer left without resolving the pricing issue.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced it, asked if it's okay if it's a bit over, the customer agreed. Then the employee charged $6.98 per pound for 1.745lbs, totaling $12.18. The customer noticed the discrepancy and pointed it out, the employee said the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer was told it was over a pound, then the employee took the meat back, rebagged it, and ended up with 2 slices plus a half-slice. The customer then left without saying anything else. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The employee made a mistake in the price, charging the higher rate without updating the sign. The customer tried to correct it, the employee was dismissive. Then, when the employee tried to adjust the weight, the customer was annoyed and left. \n\nThe key points here: The customer was polite initially. The employee's response was \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\" That's a bit confusing. If the price was actually $6.98, then the sign is wrong, but the employee is applying the new price. The customer is being charged more than the listed price. That's a store error. The customer had the right to question it. \n\nThen the employee asks if it's okay if it's a little over, the customer says yes. But the weight was 1.745lbs. The employee then takes the meat back, but when rebagging, she puts 2 slices and tears another in half. The customer is then told the total is adjusted. But the customer is frustrated by the employee's confusion and leaves. \n\nThe customer didn't confront the manager, but the user mentions they \"just wanted to buy groceries.\" The employee's handling of the situation wasn't clear. Maybe the employee was trying to adjust the weight to match the higher price? But the customer is the one who's being overcharged. \n\nSo, the author's actions were leaving without resolving. In AITA contexts, sometimes people are expected to handle it calmly. But the employee's response was incorrect. The customer is in a position where the store is charging the wrong price. The customer could have pointed out the new price is wrong, but the employee was already incorrect. \n\nWait, the employee said the price went up but the sign wasn't changed. The customer was asking for the listed price. So the employee is trying to apply the new price. The store might have a policy where if the price is incorrect, they charge the listed price. But the employee is charging the higher price. \n\nBut the customer was told the weight was 1.745lbs. The customer agreed to the weight being a little over, but the price discrepancy is larger. The customer caught the mistake and tried to correct it. The employee then tried to adjust the weight, which made the customer even more frustrated. \n\nIn this case, the customer wasn't wrong to point out the error. The employee's handling was unprofessional and confusing. The customer left to avoid further confrontation, which is understandable. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the store made the pricing error, the employee was unhelpful, and the customer had the right to leave. However, the customer could have tried to speak to a manager, but the user says they didn't want to be confrontational. Still, the employee's actions were the main issue here.\n"
