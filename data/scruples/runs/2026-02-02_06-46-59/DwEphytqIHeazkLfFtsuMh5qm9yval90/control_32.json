She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to the deli to buy turkey meat. They asked for 1lb at $3.98/lb. The employee made a mistake, charged them for 1.745 lbs at $6.98. The customer points out the error, the employee says the price increased but didn't update the sign. Then the employee tries to fix the weight by taking out slices, but the customer gets frustrated and leaves.\n\nSo, the customer is upset because the price was wrong and the employee handled it poorly. The employee didn't correct the price correctly, maybe didn't communicate well. The customer left without finishing the interaction. Now the question is whether the customer is in the wrong.\n\nFrom what I read, the customer was polite at first, noticed the mistake, tried to correct it. The employee's response might have been confusing. The customer's irritation is understandable because they were being overcharged. When the employee tried to fix it by removing slices, the customer walked out. Maybe they felt it was taking too long or the employee wasn't resolving the issue properly. \n\nIs the customer wrong for leaving? They didn't escalate to a manager, but maybe they could have handled it more politely. However, the situation was likely frustrating. The customer might not be in the wrong because they were a victim of a pricing error and the employee didn't handle it well. The customer's actions were a reaction to poor service. Maybe the employee should have offered a refund or correction immediately. So the answer might be B, the customer isn't in the wrong.\n"
