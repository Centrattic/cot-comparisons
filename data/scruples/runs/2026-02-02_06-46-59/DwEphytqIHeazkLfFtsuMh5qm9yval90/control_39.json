She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli employee who charged the wrong price for sliced turkey meat. The author noticed the error, confronted the employee, but got frustrated with the employee's response and just left without resolving it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The employee made a pricing error, perhaps due to not updating the sign. The customer pointed it out, and the employee tried to correct it but in a way that the customer found unsatisfactory. The customer then left without finishing the transaction. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong for leaving abruptly. To determine this, I need to think about the employee's actions and the customer's response. The employee might have been confused or untrained, leading to the mistake. The customer tried to correct the price but got irritated when the employee didn't handle it properly. The employee then tried to fix the weight by removing slices, but the customer didn't accept the new amount, which was priced at $6.98 per pound instead of the original $3.98.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be losing patience due to the employee's inadequate response. The customer left instead of escalating to a manager. Now, whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn such situations, the customer's responsibility is to handle the issue properly. If there's a pricing error, pointing it out is the right thing to do. However, when the employee corrects the error but the customer is unhappy with the new price (since $6.98 is higher than $3.98), the customer might feel they have to pay more than expected. The employee might have made an honest mistake, but the customer could be justified in not wanting to pay the higher price. \n\nThe author's action of walking out without resolving it might be seen as a failure to follow up. Typically, if there's a problem with pricing, the next step is to talk to a manager or supervisor. By not doing so, the author might be denying the employee the chance to correct the issue properly. However, the author might argue that the employee wasn't cooperating and that dealing with the situation was too frustrating.\n\nOn the other hand, the employee might have been acting in good faith but was confused. The customer's frustration is understandable if they felt the employee was not helpful or if the new price was unexpected. The original request was for a lower-priced item, and the employee mistakenly charged the higher price. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author's decision to leave is a justified response. Since the employee corrected the weight but not the price, or maybe the employee couldn't adjust the price and had to charge the higher rate, the author might have the right to decline the product if they don't agree with the new price. \n\nAlternatively, if the employee was supposed to charge $3.98 but mistakenly charged $6.98, the author is right to point it out. If the employee can't correct the price, the author might not want to proceed with the purchase. In that case, leaving might be a reasonable response. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for leaving because they made a valid point about the price discrepancy and the employee's response didn't resolve the issue to their satisfaction. The author could have escalated, but they chose not to, which is their right if they're not happy with the employee's handling. The employee might not have the authority to adjust the price, so the author may have correctly identified that further action wasn't possible and decided to walk away rather than argue. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
