She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole for leaving the deli girl confused and not explaining the situation further. So, the situation is they asked for a pound of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound, but the employee gave them almost 1.7 pounds priced at $6.98 per pound. They politely pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then when the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee took the meat back, took slices out, tore one, and tried to give it back. The customer then left without saying anything else.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether the customer was wrong for just walking out. Let's break it down. The employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The customer tried to correct it politely. The employee then tried to fix it by reducing the amount of meat. The customer was clearly frustrated and left. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, the employee might have been making a mistake, but the customer's response was to leave without resolving the issue. However, the customer was trying to correct the overcharge and the overage in weight. The employee's actions of taking out slices and tearing one might have been confusing or unsatisfactory. The customer didn't escalate to a manager, which could be a proper step. But the customer felt they didn't want to be \"that guy\" and just left. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the customer's frustration is understandable, but walking out without trying to resolve it could be seen as not standing up for their rights. However, the employee's behavior might have contributed to the customer's loss of patience. The customer was polite initially but then left. The employee's actions might have been inefficient or confusing, leading to the customer's decision. \n\nSo, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to address a mistake. The employee's handling of the situation was poor. However, the customer could have tried to speak to a manager. But since they left, maybe they're not the asshole. Alternatively, maybe they should have stayed and followed up. \n\nI think the key here is whether the customer had a duty to confront the error. Since they noticed an overcharge and the employee was correcting it by reducing the amount, but the customer was left confused and frustrated. The customer's reaction was to leave. The employee's mistake was the root cause. The customer's actions might be seen as justified given the employee's unprofessional handling. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because leaving without resolving it could be seen as not trying to fix the issue. However, the customer was polite and tried to correct it, and the employee's response was unhelpful. So maybe the customer is not the asshole.\n"
