She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a customer interaction at a deli. The author went to buy some turkey meat, asked for 1lb at $3.98 per pound, but ended up with 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The employee made a pricing mistake, then there was some back and forth about the weight and price. The author got frustrated and left without finishing the transaction.\n\nFirst, I should consider the facts. The employee initially priced the meat at $3.98, but the actual price was higher. The author noticed the error and tried to point it out. The employee then tried to fix it by removing some meat, but the way they did it (taking out slices, tearing one in half) might have seemed haphazard or unprofessional to the author. The author felt that the employee wasn't addressing the issue properly and lost patience, so they left.\n\nNow, from the customer's perspective, the author is justified in pointing out the price discrepancy. The employee's mistake was valid, and the customer has the right to question that. However, when the employee tried to correct it by removing meat, the author might have been frustrated if the employee wasn't being transparent or efficient in resolving the issue. The employee's method of removing slices and weighing them might have been unprofessional, but it's also possible they were trying to correct the weight while adjusting to the new price.\n\nThe key here is the author's reaction. They walked out without finishing the transaction. Is that reasonable? The author was irritated, but is it their responsibility to stay and deal with the situation? If the employee was in the process of correcting the mistake, leaving might be seen as abandoning the employee, but the author might feel that the employee wasn't handling it correctly. However, the author could have waited for the employee to resolve the issue or asked to speak to a manager if they felt it was taking too long or being handled improperly.\n\nOn the other hand, the employee's actions could have been more efficient. Tearing a slice in half to adjust the weight might not be the best way to handle it, and the initial confusion about the price could have been handled better. If the employee had a manager present or a more systematic way to correct the error, the situation might have been resolved without the author leaving.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but walking out without resolving the issue might be seen as the author being in the wrong if the employee was genuinely trying to fix the mistake. However, if the employee was being unhelpful or dismissive, the author's actions could be justified. The story says the employee started rebagging and pricing again after the author pointed out the weight. The author might have felt that the employee wasn't addressing the core issue (the price discrepancy) and was just going through the motions. In that case, the author's decision to leave might be seen as a reasonable choice, especially if they were stressed or in a hurry.\n\nIn retail situations, customers are expected to handle minor issues, but when there's a clear mistake by the employee, it's the store's responsibility to correct it. The author was pointing out a legitimate issue, and the employee's response might not have been satisfactory. If the employee was taking too long or not solving the problem, the author might have felt it was better to step away. However, walking out without trying to resolve it completely might leave the employee in a difficult spot, but the author might not have wanted to engage further.\n\nIn summary, the author pointed out a mistake, the employee tried to correct it, but the method wasn't satisfactory. The author left, which could be seen as a personal choice but might not be the wrong thing to do if they were frustrated. However, the best practice would be to either wait for the employee to resolve it properly or ask for a manager. Since the author didn't go to a manager, and just left, that could be considered in the wrong. But the employee's handling of the situation wasn't great either. So it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author was the one who walked out and didn't seek to resolve it, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but some might argue they're not in the wrong (B) given the employee's actions."
