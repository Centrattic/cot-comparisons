She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after an argument over pricing and weight.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee overcharged by pricing it at $6.98 and gave almost 1.75lbs. The author pointed out the mistake, but the employee was dismissive, leading to frustration.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author handle the situation appropriately? The employee made a mistake in pricing and weight. The author correctly noticed the error and tried to address it. The employee didn't acknowledge the mistake and was unhelpful, which escalated the situation.\n\nThe author became irritated and left without resolving it. Now, the question is whether that makes the author the asshole (ITA). \n\nOn one hand, the employee was in the wrong by overcharging. The author was right to point out the mistake. However, the author's reaction\u2014leaving the employee with the meat and not speaking\u2014could be seen as abrupt. But considering the employee's dismissive behavior, maybe the author felt justified. \n\nIs walking out without a word inconsiderate? It's possible, but the author was frustrated. The employee was already not helpful, so the author might have wanted to avoid further conflict. \n\nSo, the main factors: The error was the employee's, and the store's responsibility. The author tried to correct it but was met with resistance. The author's decision to leave might have been impulsive, but the fault primarily lies with the employee and the store. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
