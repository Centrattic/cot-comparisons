She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about someone going to a deli, getting overcharged, and then leaving without saying anything. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The person asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli worker gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb. The person pointed out the mistake, the worker said the price increased but didn't change the sign. Then when the person noticed the weight was over a pound, the worker took the meat back, tried to rebag it by taking out slices and weighing them. The person got frustrated and left without dealing with it further.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The worker made a pricing error. She first charged the higher price without updating the sign, then when the weight was over a pound, she tried to adjust by taking slices out. The customer tried to correct her politely but was met with defensiveness. The customer then lost patience and left.\n\nIs the customer wrong for leaving without resolving it? Well, the worker was in the wrong for the pricing mistake and not handling the situation properly. The customer tried to point it out, but the worker's response was dismissive. The customer's frustration is understandable. They didn't escalate by talking to a manager, but they also didn't pay the incorrect price. They left, which might be seen as not standing up for themselves, but maybe they just wanted to avoid a conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store made the error, the worker handled it poorly. The customer isn't obligated to accept the wrong charge. The author left, maybe out of frustration, but isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to correct the issue but couldn't handle the worker's response. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
