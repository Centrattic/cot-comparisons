She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without explaining. So, first, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The employee sliced it, then charged $6.98/lb for 1.745lbs, totaling $12.18. The author pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee said the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author then questions the weight, the employee checks, takes out the meat, and the author leaves without paying or clarifying.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The employee made a mistake in pricing, charging double the rate. The author caught this and tried to correct it politely.\n2. The employee then tried to justify the price by saying the sign wasn't updated. The author then noticed the weight was over a pound, which they had agreed to be okay if it's a bit over. However, the employee then took the meat back, started weighing and rebagging, but the method (using 2 slices, tearing another) might have been incorrect.\n3. The author became frustrated and left without finishing the transaction.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The author did point out the mistake. The employee's response was to correct the price without acknowledging the error. Then, when the author brought up the weight, the employee started rebagging but possibly incorrectly. The author's frustration led them to leave without resolving the issue.\n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the employee should have resolved the pricing error first. The author had the right to question the incorrect charge. However, when the employee started rebagging, maybe there was confusion. The author walking out might have been an overreaction, but the employee's actions (tearing slices, not explaining clearly) could have contributed.\n\nBut legally and ethically, the author is not at fault for noticing the pricing mistake. The employee made an error, and the author tried to correct it. The employee's handling of the situation might have been poor. The author leaving without paying might be an issue if they took the product without paying, but in the story, they left the basket and walked out. Wait, the author says they put the basket down and walked out. So they didn't take the product? Then maybe they just left the employee without clarification. \n\nIn that case, the author is not paying for the incorrect charge but also not taking the product. So they're not in the wrong for refusing to accept the incorrect charge. The employee's mistake was on their end. The author's frustration is understandable given the confusion and the employee's response. The author isn't obligated to stay and argue; they can choose to leave. \n\nHowever, the author could have informed the employee that they were leaving and not proceeding with the purchase. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving without explaining. The answer would be no because the employee made the error, and the author's actions, while abrupt, were a result of the employee's poor handling. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
