She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. Let me read through the situation again to understand both sides.\n\nThe author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, and the price ended up being over $12 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the author got frustrated when the employee didn't immediately realize the weight discrepancy. The employee tried to rebag it by cutting slices to make it exactly 1lb, and the author just left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The employee might have made a pricing error, which is on the store. The author is a customer who's being overcharged. The employee's response that the price went up but the sign wasn't changed\u2014that's a store policy issue. The employee then didn't handle the situation well, maybe not trained properly. The author tried to point out the mistake politely, got irritated when the employee didn't catch the weight issue, and decided to leave. \n\nIs leaving without saying a word wrong? The author's frustration is understandable, especially when dealing with a confusing or incorrect situation. The employee was trying to fix it by cutting slices, which might have been time-consuming or unprofessional. The author didn't want to escalate to talking to a manager, so they left. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one who made the pricing error. The employee and the store are responsible for accurate pricing and clear communication. The author's frustration is valid given the situation. While it's polite to clarify and perhaps give the employee a chance to correct the mistake, the author's reaction is a personal choice. They didn't harm anyone by leaving; they just chose not to engage further. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have given the employee more time to resolve the issue or at least communicated their dissatisfaction. But the employee was already aware of the pricing error and started to rebag, which might not satisfy the author's request for exact weight. The author's main issue was the weight being over a pound, not just the price. The employee's method of rebagging might not have been efficient, leading to the author's loss of patience. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because the mistake was on the store's side. The author's response, while abrupt, was a reaction to the employee's handling of the situation. They didn't engage in confrontation but chose to leave, which is a personal decision. The store is at fault for the pricing error and employee training. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
