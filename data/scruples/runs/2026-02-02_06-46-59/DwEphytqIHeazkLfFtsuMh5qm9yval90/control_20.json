She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a deli counter where the customer ordered a pound of turkey meat. The deli worker messed up the price and weight. The customer pointed out the mistake, the worker tried to fix it by taking out some meat, but the customer got so frustrated they just left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb at $3.98/lb. The worker gave 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer correctly noticed the discrepancy. The worker said the price had gone up but didn't change the sign. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, the worker took the meat back and tried to adjust by cutting slices. The customer was irritated and left without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the customer (the author) is wrong for not engaging further. The key points here are the worker's mistake and the customer's reaction. The worker made an error in both price and weight. The customer tried to bring it up politely. The worker then tried to fix it by reducing the amount, but maybe not adequately. The customer, frustrated, left without confrontation.\n\nIs the customer wrong for not standing up for themselves? Well, the worker was incorrect in the charge and the amount. The customer had the right to question that. But when the worker tried to fix it, maybe the customer could have been more patient. However, the worker seems to be in the wrong for not addressing the issue properly. The customer's frustration is understandable given the confusion and incorrect pricing. Walking out might not be the best approach, but it might not be entirely their fault. The worker was unhelpful and possibly dismissive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is responsible for accurate pricing and weight. The customer is right to point out the mistake. The worker's response was inadequate. The customer might have escalated the issue to a manager, but they chose not to. However, the customer's reaction of leaving might be seen as a personal choice, but they weren't rude beyond expressing irritation. The worker was holding the meat and trying to fix it, but the customer left. So, maybe the customer is not in the wrong because the worker was unresponsive. But is leaving without a word wrong? It could be seen as abrupt, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The main issue is the worker's mistake. The customer acted within their rights to challenge the error. The worker's response was insufficient, so the customer's frustration is justified. Therefore, the customer is not in the wrong.\n"
