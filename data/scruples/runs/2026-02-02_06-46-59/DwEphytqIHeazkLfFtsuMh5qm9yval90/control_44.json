She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli counter interaction where the customer is charged a higher price than what was displayed and ends up leaving without resolving the issue.\n\nFirst, the customer ordered turkey at $3.98 per pound but was charged $6.98 per pound for 1.745 pounds. The employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, and the employee took out the meat, cutting it down to what the customer considered too thin. The customer then left without finishing the interaction, feeling unable to handle the employee's actions.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The customer is right to notice the price discrepancy. If the sign says $3.98 but the actual price is higher, that's a problem for the store. However, the customer was initially polite but became irritated. The employee may have made a mistake in overcharging, but the customer's reaction was to leave abruptly. \n\nThe key points are: Did the customer act in an unreasonable way? The customer tried to resolve the issue, but when the employee was cutting the meat into very thin slices (which might be the correct weight but not what the customer wanted), they lost patience. The customer could have asked to speak to a manager or waited for the employee to correct the weight properly. By leaving without resolving it, the customer might be seen as avoiding conflict, which is understandable, but not necessarily wrong. \n\nThe employee's behavior\u2014taking the meat back, cutting it, and not addressing the price issue satisfactorily\u2014probably contributed to the customer's frustration. The customer's main issue was being overcharged and then not getting the correct amount of product. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a last resort after the employee's uncooperative attitude. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving. The store made a mistake in pricing and the employee's handling of the situation was poor. The customer's actions were a response to being overcharged and not being satisfied with the resolution attempt. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
