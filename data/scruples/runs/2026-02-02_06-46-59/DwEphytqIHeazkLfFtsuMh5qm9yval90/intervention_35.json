She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter without confronting the employee further. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee made a bag with 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the discrepancy, pointed it out, and the employee corrected it by removing some meat to get the weight down. However, the author left without saying anything else.\n\nNow, considering the employee's actions. The employee initially gave more meat than requested and at a higher price. When confronted, the employee tried to correct the weight, but maybe not adequately. The author felt frustrated and left. \n\nThe key points here are the employee's mistake in pricing and quantity. The employee admitted the price had increased but didn't update the sign, leading to confusion. The author tried to point out the weight issue, and the employee attempted to fix it. However, the author left abruptly, which could be seen as impolite. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The employee made an error, and the author tried to correct it. The employee then tried to correct the weight. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with the employee's dismissive attitude. Walking away might be a reasonable reaction to avoid conflict, but leaving without addressing the issue could mean the problem isn't resolved. However, the author didn't escalate it to a manager, which is a valid choice if they didn't want to cause a scene. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't being greedy; they're pointing out a mistake. The employee's mistake cost the customer money (higher price per pound and more weight than requested). The author's reaction, while abrupt, was a personal choice to walk out rather than engage further. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might say they should have stayed to ensure the correct price and weight. Others might see it as a reasonable exit due to frustration. But the author isn't the one at fault for the mistake; that's the employee. The author's main fault is the abrupt exit, which could be seen as rude, but given the context, it's a judgment call. The key is whether the author acted wrongfully by leaving. Since the employee made the error, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it and then choosing to leave. So, the answer is B.\n"
