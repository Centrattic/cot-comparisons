She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter in confusion. The situation involves a pricing discrepancy and a confusing interaction with the deli worker.\n\nFirst, the author goes to the deli to buy oven-roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee asks if it's okay if it's a bit over a pound, implying the price might go a bit over. The author agrees. However, the final product is over 1.7 pounds and priced at $6.98 per pound, which is a significant increase. The author points out the discrepancy, and the employee claims the price has gone up but the sign wasn't updated. The employee then tries to adjust the weight by tearing slices and rebagging, but ends up with a much smaller amount. The author leaves in frustration.\n\nNow, considering the actions of both parties. The deli worker made a mistake in pricing and then tried to correct the weight by removing meat, which seems like an attempt to avoid charging the higher price. However, the author's reaction was to leave without further confrontation. The author did try to politely point out the issue but became frustrated after the employee's responses. The key here is whether the author had an obligation to stay and address the issue, perhaps by speaking to a manager.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't want to be the \"guy who's like 'Can I speak to your manager?'\" and chose to walk out. The question is about whether this action makes the author the asshole. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: The store is at fault for incorrect pricing and the employee's mishandling of the situation. The author tried to address the issue calmly. However, by leaving without resolving it, the author might be avoiding a necessary confrontation. But given the employee's confusion and the store's error, the author's frustration is understandable. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to escalate further, especially if they felt their complaint wouldn't be resolved. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to find a resolution, like talking to a manager. But since the employee was the one who made the mistake, the author's reaction is more about self-respect and not wanting to be taken advantage of. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for walking out after the employee failed to correct the issue properly. The author's actions were a response to the store's mistake and the employee's incompetence, not the other way around. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
