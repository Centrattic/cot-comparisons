She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the author of the story did the right thing by leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author went to the deli counter and asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced the turkey and asked if it being a little over was okay. The author agreed. The employee then bagged it, but the price was $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98. The author points out the discrepancy, the employee says the price sign hasn't been updated. The author checks the weight, gets frustrated when the employee seems confused, and ends up walking out without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author's actions led to the employee being left holding a pile of meat without a word. But the employee made a pricing error, and the author was clearly frustrated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not dealing with the situation properly.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's mistake and the author's reaction. The employee might have made an error in pricing, not correctly updating the sign, and possibly miscalculating the weight. The author, feeling wronged, tried to correct the issue but became frustrated when the employee didn't understand. The author then left, which might be seen as abandoning the employee in the middle of a transaction.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were dealing with a confusing situation and chose to leave to avoid an argument. The employee might have been at fault for the pricing error, and the author was trying to correct it but got fed up. \n\nBut from a customer service perspective, the author could have asked to speak to a manager or perhaps calmly explained the issue again. Walking out without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate, leaving the employee confused and without a customer. \n\nOn the other hand, if the employee was unable to resolve the issue, the author might have been within their right to leave, especially if they felt they were being overcharged. However, the proper approach would have been to address the problem more constructively.\n\nIn summary, while the employee made a mistake, the author's abrupt departure without resolution could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not handling the situation more politely, even if they were frustrated.\n"
