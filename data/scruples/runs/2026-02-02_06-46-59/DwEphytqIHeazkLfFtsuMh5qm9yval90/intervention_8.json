She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for walking out on the deli girl without saying anything further.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author asked for a pound of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee made a mistake and charged $6.98 per pound, but the weight was over a pound. The author pointed out the discrepancy, but the employee was uncooperative, didn't correct the price, and kept trying to give a smaller portion. The author got frustrated and left without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The author was correct in noticing the pricing error. The employee's response that the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated might be a valid reason for the higher price, but the weight was also more than a pound. So the total charge seems off because both price and quantity were issues. The employee's actions of taking the meat back and reweighing it in a way that might still be incorrect could have frustrated the author.\n\nIs the author wrong for leaving? Well, the employee didn't resolve the issue. The author tried to point out the error politely but the employee was dismissive. The author felt they couldn't handle the situation, especially since they didn't want to escalate to talking to the manager. Walking out might be seen as not trying hard enough to resolve the problem. However, the author's frustration is understandable given the employee's unhelpful behavior. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: The store made a pricing error and the employee didn't correct it. The author is not at fault for noticing the mistake. However, leaving without addressing it might be seen as not taking the necessary steps to correct the issue. But the author's main goal was to buy groceries, and when that became impossible due to the employee's actions, walking out could be justified as they were done trying to resolve it.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the store was at fault. However, their abrupt exit without trying to resolve it further might be seen as not fully addressing the problem. But given the employee's uncooperative behavior, the author's decision to leave could be seen as a reasonable response to an unsolvable situation.\n"
