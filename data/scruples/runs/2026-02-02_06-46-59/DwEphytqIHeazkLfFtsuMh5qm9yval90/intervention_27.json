She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter without resolving the pricing issue.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The author noticed the discrepancy, pointed it out politely, but the employee was dismissive and tried to fix it by cutting the meat into slices to make the weight match. The author then left without finishing the interaction.\n\nThe key points to consider are the actions of both parties. The deli employee made a pricing error, which the author correctly identified. The employee's response was problematic\u2014denying the mistake initially, being uncooperative, and then attempting to correct the weight in a way that didn't seem right. The author felt frustrated and left without engaging further.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to walk out. The employee's behavior was unprofessional and incorrect. The author tried to address the issue politely but faced resistance. Given that the author's goal was to purchase groceries and they were met with hostility, their frustration is understandable. Walking out to avoid an argument or further frustration isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the author felt that the employee wasn't trying to resolve the issue honestly. The author isn't obligated to stay in a situation that's causing stress if they believe they're being treated unfairly.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried to escalate the issue by speaking to a manager. But the author mentions not wanting to be \"that guy\" and just wanting to buy groceries. In a real-life scenario, people do have different thresholds for confrontation, and choosing to leave could be a valid decision based on personal judgment.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the deli made the initial mistake and the employee's handling of it was poor. The author's response, while abrupt, was a result of being pushed beyond their patience. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving, especially since the employee didn't act in a helpful manner.\n"
