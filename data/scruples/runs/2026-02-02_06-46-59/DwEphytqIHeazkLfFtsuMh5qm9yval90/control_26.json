She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. The situation involves a price discrepancy and a weight issue.\n\nFirst, the key points: The customer asked for oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound, but the deli employee gave them meat priced at $6.98 per pound. The weight was also over a pound, which the customer pointed out. The employee initially said the price had gone up without changing the sign, which might be a valid reason, but the customer was confused. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight, the employee took the meat back and started rebagging it into a smaller amount. \n\nThe customer then left without speaking further. Now, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nThe deli employee made a mistake in pricing and possibly in the weight. The customer was polite in pointing out the errors. The employee's response about the price change might be true, but it's a common tactic to avoid responsibility. When the customer pointed out the weight, the employee tried to fix it by cutting the slices, which could be seen as trying to cover up the mistake or not being transparent. \n\nThe customer left because they were frustrated. The employee's behavior\u2014like asking where the weight was indicated and then cutting the meat\u2014might have been confusing or insincere. The customer wasn't aggressive; they just walked out. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the customer isn't wrong for pointing out the mistake. The employee's actions might have been unprofessional. The customer's frustration is understandable given the situation, and walking out instead of escalating to a manager might be a personal choice, but not necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the customer isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves against a mistake and leaving when they felt the situation wasn't being handled correctly.\n"
