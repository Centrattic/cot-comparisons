She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused after a pricing issue. \n\nFirst, the author went to the deli to buy turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee mistakenly charged $6.98 per pound, resulting in a higher price for almost two pounds. The author politely pointed out the mistake, and the employee corrected it by taking out the meat, adjusting the weight, and trying to give back the product.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's error in pricing and the author's reaction. The employee's response that the price had gone up but the sign wasn't updated might be a problem, but the main issue here is the incorrect charge. The author was frustrated because they were overcharged and had to deal with the employee's mistake. \n\nThe author's irritation seems reasonable given the error. However, the way they left, putting down the basket and walking out without communicating further, might be seen as abrupt. The employee was confused and left holding the meat, which could be considered impolite. \n\nBut considering the employee's mistake in both price and weight, the author had valid reasons to be upset. The question is whether the author handled it inappropriately. While the employee was at fault for the error, the author could have handled it more diplomatically, like asking to speak to a manager. However, the user's decision to leave might be justified if they didn't want to escalate the situation. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a toss-up. The employee made the mistake, but the author's reaction might have been too abrupt. However, given the employee's explanation and the author's frustration, it's possible the author is not entirely at fault. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), as the author had valid reasons to be upset, though they could have handled it better. The employee's errors contributed significantly to the situation.\n"
