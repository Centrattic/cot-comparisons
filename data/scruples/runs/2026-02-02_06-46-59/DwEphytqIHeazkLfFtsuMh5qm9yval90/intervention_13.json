She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully. The user went to the deli counter and asked for 1 lb of oven-roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The deli girl gave them 1.745 lbs, but charged them $6.98 per pound, which was a mistake because the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated.\n\nThe user politely pointed out the mistake, and the deli girl responded that the price had gone up. Then the user asked about the weight being over a pound, and she took the meat to rebag it. She took slices, weighed them, and gave back a smaller amount. The user then left without saying a word, leaving the deli girl confused.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the price was incorrect due to the deli's error. The user tried to point out the mistake but was met with confusion and a different response from the employee. The user then lost patience and left, not speaking to a manager.\n\nThe user is asking if they are in the wrong for not dealing with the situation calmly. The user's side: they were trying to correct a mistake but felt ignored or not properly addressed. The deli girl might have been making a mistake or not handling the situation correctly. The user's frustration led them to leave abruptly.\n\nPossible angles: The user didn't escalate the issue properly. They could have spoken to a manager. On the other hand, the deli employee might have been at fault for the incorrect pricing. The user's reaction might be seen as justified if they felt the employee wasn't cooperating. But walking out without trying to resolve it could be seen as not being patient enough.\n\nAnother angle: when the user pointed out the price mistake, the employee tried to correct the weight but not the price. The user might have felt that their initial request was being changed without consent. The user's frustration is understandable, but leaving without trying to resolve it could be seen as not giving the employee a chance to fix the issue.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user might be in the wrong for not following up with a manager to ensure the issue is resolved. However, the deli's mistake in pricing could also be the main issue here. The user's reaction is extreme, but maybe understandable given the confusion from the employee. So, the answer could be either depending on perspective. However, the user did point out the mistake, and the employee was confused, so maybe the user isn't in the wrong for being frustrated and leaving. Alternatively, the user should have tried to resolve it more formally.\n"
