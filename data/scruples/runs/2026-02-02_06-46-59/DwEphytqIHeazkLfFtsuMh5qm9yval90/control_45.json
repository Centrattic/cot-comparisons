She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is at a deli. The person went to buy some turkey meat. The deli girl gave them almost two pounds, but charged them at a higher price. The customer pointed out the mistake, the deli girl said the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then the customer asked about the weight, she tried to check, and the customer walked out.\n\nFirst, let's look at the customer's actions. They politely told the deli girl about the price discrepancy. Then when the weight was wrong, they got irritated and walked out. The deli girl's behavior seems confusing and possibly incorrect\u2014overcharging, not confirming the correct weight, and then handling the meat in a way that might be incorrect again when rebagging.\n\nThe customer's main issue was the overcharge and incorrect weight. They tried to address it politely but the employee's response was unhelpful. The customer might have felt that the situation was not being resolved properly. The author walked out without paying, which is a problem because they didn't settle the payment. If they walked out without paying for the correct amount, that's theft. But if they paid the correct amount and left, that's different. The story says they put the basket down and walked out. It's unclear if they paid anything. The key point is whether the customer left without completing the transaction. If they didn't pay at all, that's definitely wrong. However, if the deli girl was trying to fix it and the customer left before resolving, maybe the customer is at fault for not following through. Also, the deli girl might have made a mistake, but the customer's action of walking out could be seen as abandoning the purchase, which is their right but leaving without paying would be wrong. The story is a bit ambiguous, but if the customer didn't pay and left, they're in the wrong. If they just left the basket and walked out, perhaps they were done and not paying, which is theft. So the answer might be A, but need to see if they paid.\n"
