She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for walking out on the deli girl. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli to buy turkey meat. The price was supposed to be $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 pounds, but charged $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee initially denied it, saying the price had gone up but the sign wasn't changed. Then, when the author mentioned the weight being over a pound, the employee tried to fix it by cutting slices and putting them in a new bag.\n\nNow, the author got really frustrated and just left. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nHmm. So, the employee made a pricing error, overcharged the customer, and didn't handle the situation well. The author tried to point out the mistake but the employee was dismissive and didn't resolve it properly. The author then left without paying, which might be a problem.\n\nWait, but the author didn't steal. They tried to get the correct price. The employee might be at fault for the mistake, but the author's actions of walking out could be seen as not standing up for themselves properly. But maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nThe author didn't confront the employee further or go to management. They just left the situation. The employee was incorrect in both the price and the weight. The author's frustration is understandable, but leaving without completing the purchase might not be the right approach. However, is it the author's fault for being fed up?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have asked to speak to a manager or refused to pay the incorrect amount. But they chose not to be the guy who asks for the manager. So, is the author in the wrong for not standing up for their rights, or is the deli employee in the wrong for making the mistake?\n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't actually pay the incorrect amount. They just left the deli without paying. That's a problem. Even if the employee was wrong, the author still needs to resolve the issue properly. By leaving, they might be considered in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation appropriately. However, the employee's mistake was significant, and the author's frustration is valid. But legally and ethically, the author should have either paid the correct amount or left the store. If they left without paying, that's theft. But in this case, the author might not have had a choice if the employee was not cooperating.\n\nWait, but the author didn't take the meat. They put their basket down and walked out. So maybe they didn't take the overpriced meat. Therefore, they didn't pay, but didn't take the item either. So perhaps they didn't commit theft. But the situation is still unresolved. The author probably should have insisted on the correct price or left the store without the product.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the deli made the mistake. The author tried to correct it but was met with resistance. The author's reaction was to leave, which might be seen as not handling it constructively. However, the deli employee is clearly at fault for the pricing error. The author's frustration is justified, but their action of leaving might not be the right approach. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not, because they were the victim of the mistake, but their method of resolving it was poor. Alternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because the employee was incorrect, but they handled it poorly.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether not paying and leaving is considered wrong. If the author left the store without the product and without paying, maybe they aren't at fault. However, if they left the store without resolving the payment, perhaps they are. It's a bit of a gray area. But given that the employee made the mistake, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the correct action would be to either pay the correct amount or not take the product. The author didn't take the product, so maybe they aren't at fault. But maybe the question is more about their emotional reaction and not following up.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation properly, even though the employee was wrong. The author should have either paid the correct amount or left the store without the product. By leaving without dealing with it, they might be seen as not standing up for themselves correctly. Alternatively, if they just left without the product, they aren't in the wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, the author didn't take the meat. They walked out. So they didn't pay, but they didn't take the meat. Therefore, they didn't commit theft. So maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the problem is that they didn't resolve the issue. They could have gone to management or at least ensured that the mistake was corrected. But they just left, which might be considered not taking responsibility. However, given the employee's behavior, maybe the author's reaction is understandable. I'm a bit torn here.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the main issue is the deli's mistake. The author tried to correct it but was met with resistance. The author's frustration is valid. Their action of leaving might be seen as not the best approach, but they aren't in the wrong for being upset. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But I'm not sure. The author didn't pay, but they didn't take the meat either. So they didn't make a mistake in terms of paying for it. The employee is in the wrong for the mistake. The author's reaction might be poor, but they aren't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
