She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction. \n\nFirst, the person ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee admitted the price was increased but hadn't updated the sign. Then, the employee took the meat, reweighed it, and tried to give back about 0.7lbs, leading the customer to walk out in frustration.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The customer initially noticed the pricing discrepancy. The employee made a mistake by charging the higher price without informing the customer properly. The customer was polite in pointing out the weight being over a pound. The employee then tried to fix it by removing slices, but maybe didn't explain the price change clearly. The customer walked out without speaking to a manager. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Well, they did try to address the issue politely. The employee's response might have been confusing or dismissive. The customer's frustration led them to leave, which is understandable given the confusion and the employee's handling. However, walking out without resolving the issue might be seen as not following up, but the employee might have been at fault for the pricing error. \n\nThe key points: the employee's mistake in pricing and the way they handled the correction. The customer's reaction, while abrupt, was a result of the employee's error and their own frustration. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
