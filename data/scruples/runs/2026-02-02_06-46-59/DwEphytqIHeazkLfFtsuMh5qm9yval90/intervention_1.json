She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. I need to figure out the answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then the author got frustrated because the weight was over a pound, and the employee tried to adjust the weight by taking out slices. The author left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, maybe a weight error too. The author tried to correct it but got annoyed. The employee might have been trying to fix it by reducing the weight. The author left without finishing the interaction.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did confront the employee politely first. The employee seemed to make mistakes in both price and weight. The author was right to notice the discrepancy. However, when the employee tried to adjust the weight, the author just left. The employee might have been trying to correct the error, but the author's reaction was abrupt. \n\nBut wait, the employee initially charged the wrong price, then the weight was more than asked. The author had a right to question both. The employee's response about the price change not being updated on the sign is a valid explanation, but the weight being over a pound wasn't addressed properly. The employee tried to fix it by removing slices, but the author didn't engage further. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is responsible for accurate pricing and weight. The author is within their rights to check both. However, the author's reaction was to leave without resolving the issue. The employee might have been confused or making a mistake, but the author could have waited for her to finish adjusting the weight. Leaving abruptly might not be the best approach, but the employee was at fault for the initial errors. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They wanted to buy groceries without hassle. The employee's actions led to confusion. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the mistake, but maybe could have handled it more patiently. However, considering the employee's errors, the author's actions might be justified. So, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
