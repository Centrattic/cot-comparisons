She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for leaving the deli counter abruptly after a confusing interaction. \n\nFirst, the situation: The writer went to the deli, ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but priced it at $6.98/lb, which is higher than the original price. The writer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to justify it by saying the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, when the writer noted the weight was over a pound, the employee took the meat back and tried to adjust it by removing slices.\n\nThe writer got irritated, left the basket there, and walked out. They're now wondering if they were wrong to do that instead of confronting the manager.\n\nSo, the key points here. The employee made a pricing error, which is on them. They also gave more weight than requested but charged a higher price. The writer is correct in pointing out the mistake. However, when the employee tried to correct it by removing slices, the writer walked out without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, considering what the right action should be. The writer is a customer who was overcharged and given incorrect weight. They have the right to question the error. The employee's response seems dismissive and incorrect. The writer's frustration is understandable. But when the employee tried to fix it by removing slices, the writer just left. \n\nLeaving without resolving the issue might be seen as not giving the employee a chance to correct the problem. Maybe the employee was making another mistake, or maybe they were trying to fix it. However, the writer's approach was abrupt and left the employee in a bad position. \n\nBut on the other hand, the employee had already made two mistakes (price and weight), and the writer was clearly wronged. The writer's frustration is justified, but walking out without a resolution could be seen as not taking the proper steps to address the issue. The correct step would be to speak to a manager or at least ensure the employee corrects the mistake properly.\n\nSo, the writer is not in the wrong for pointing out the error, but in the way they handled the resolution. By leaving abruptly, they didn't follow up to ensure their issue was resolved properly. They could have asked to speak to a manager instead of just walking out. Therefore, the answer might be that the writer is slightly in the wrong for not following through properly, even though the employee made the initial mistakes.\n"
