She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where there was a pricing discrepancy.\n\nSo the author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee makes a mistake, charges them $6.98 per pound for 1.745 lbs. The author points out the mistake politely. The employee claims the price has gone up but didn't change the sign, then starts reweighing the product but ends up with a smaller amount. The author walks out without finishing the interaction, leaving the employee confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was correct to notice the error. The employee made a mistake in pricing and quantity. The author tried to correct it politely. However, when the employee corrected the weight but not the price, maybe there's confusion. The employee might have intended to charge the higher price for the extra weight. But the author was upset because the weight was over a pound, which wasn't expected. Then the employee tried to give a smaller amount, but the author walked out.\n\nSo the key points: The author's actions\u2014leaving without resolving the issue or speaking to a manager. Did they have the right to walk out? The employee was trying to fix it by reducing the amount. The author might have been frustrated, but walking out without completing the transaction could be seen as abandoning the employee in a confusing situation. However, the author might feel they were being overcharged and didn't want to deal with the hassle.\n\nIs the author the asshole? Well, they did try to correct the mistake and then left. They didn't cause harm, but left the employee with an incomplete transaction. The employee might be left with an awkward situation. But the author was within their rights to walk out if they didn't want to proceed. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Maybe not, because they were trying to correct an error and then left. Alternatively, maybe they could have handled it better by speaking to a manager instead of walking out. But the author's justification is that they didn't want to be \"that guy\" causing trouble. \n\nSo, the employee made a mistake. The customer caught it, tried to correct it. The employee tried to adjust the weight but perhaps not the price correctly. The customer was frustrated and left. The author's actions could be seen as impulsive, but maybe not wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author is at fault for not dealing with it properly. The answer depends on whether the author had the right to leave, considering they were trying to get the correct price. Since they were being overcharged, maybe leaving was a way to avoid paying more. The employee might have been trying to fix it, but the customer didn't want to engage further. \n\nIn the end, the author might be considered in the wrong because they left the employee in a confusing situation without resolving the issue. But maybe they're not in the wrong because they were trying to get the correct price and couldn't handle the situation. It's a bit of a toss-up. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but the answer might be the other way. Hmm.\n"
