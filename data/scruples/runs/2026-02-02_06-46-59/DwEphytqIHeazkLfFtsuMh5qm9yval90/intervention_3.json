She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli counter where the customer got overcharged and then left without resolving it.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for a specific product at a certain price. The employee gave them a different price and more weight than requested. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee tried to justify it, then when confronted with the weight, the employee reweighed it incorrectly. The customer got frustrated and left without finishing the transaction.\n\nThe key points here are whether the customer had a right to be upset and if their actions were appropriate. The employee made a mistake in pricing and weight, which is the store's responsibility. The customer did approach the issue politely, but the employee's response was dismissive. The customer then lost patience and left. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the employee's actions were unprofessional and incorrect. The customer's frustration is understandable given the situation. However, leaving without addressing it might have left the employee confused, as the customer didn't explain why they left. But the customer isn't at fault for being upset with poor service. The main issue is the store's mistake, not the customer's temporary exit. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
