She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving a confused deli worker holding a pile of meat without speaking. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author goes to the deli, asks for 1 lb of oven-roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee slices it, asks if it's okay if it's a bit over, and then hands over a bag that's 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound, totaling $12.18. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author then points out the weight discrepancy, leading to a back-and-forth where the employee removes slices to get the right weight. The author, frustrated, leaves without speaking further.\n\nNow, considering the employee's actions: she initially priced the meat at the wrong price, didn't correct the weight when the customer pointed out the issue, and tried to adjust it by removing slices. The customer tried to politely address the mistake but became irritated. The key points here are the employee's errors and the customer's reaction.\n\nThe author was trying to bring up the mistake in a polite manner. The employee's response about the price sign not being updated and then handling the weight incorrectly might have escalated the situation. The author, feeling frustrated, decided to leave instead of engaging further. The question is whether this makes the author the asshole.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the employee made errors (pricing and weight) and didn't handle the customer's concerns appropriately. The customer, while frustrated, attempted to address the issue before walking out. Walking out without further confrontation could be seen as a way to avoid escalating the situation, especially if the customer felt their concerns weren't being addressed. However, leaving without resolving the issue might be seen as not giving the employee a chance to correct it properly. But considering the employee's actions, the customer's frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), as the author was trying to address a mistake made by the employee and choosing to leave out of frustration isn't necessarily their fault. The employee's errors and handling of the situation contributed significantly to the conflict.\n"
