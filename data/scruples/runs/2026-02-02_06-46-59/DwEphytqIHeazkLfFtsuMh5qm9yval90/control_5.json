She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli and asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb, which is more weight but a higher price. The author noticed the discrepancy and politely pointed it out. The employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the author had an issue with the weight being over a pound, which the employee said was okay since they asked if it was okay if it was a bit over. But the author was concerned because the price ended up higher, and the employee rebagged it with only a few slices, which the author found confusing and frustrating. The author then left without saying a word, feeling irritated.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The employee made an error in pricing, which the author correctly pointed out. The employee's response about the sign not being updated might be the store's fault, but the author had a right to question the price. However, when the employee tried to fix it by giving a smaller portion, the author became frustrated and left abruptly. The key here is whether the author's reaction was justified. The author was polite initially but became irritated. They could have either accepted the correction, asked to speak to a manager, or left. By leaving without a word, they might have been rude, but considering the confusion and the employee's error, the author's frustration might be understandable. However, the author's actions (leaving without a word) could be seen as impolite. But the main issue is the employee's mistake. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the error but might be in the wrong for the abrupt exit. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. The answer is B (No) because the author was dealing with a confusing situation caused by the employee's error, and while their reaction was abrupt, they were trying to resolve a billing issue. The responsibility isn't entirely on the author; the employee should have been more helpful and accurate. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
