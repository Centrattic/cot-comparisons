She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused and without resolving the issue.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author ordered a pound of turkey at $3.98/lb but ended up with 1.745 lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The employee initially said the price was increased but hadn't updated the sign. Then, when the author pointed out the weight discrepancy, the employee started weighing slices and tried to rebag it. The author left in frustration without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was the customer, and the employee made a mistake in pricing and possibly in the amount of meat given. The author noticed the error and brought it up politely. However, the employee's response was confusing\u2014saying the price went up but not the sign, and then trying to reweigh the product. The author felt the employee was unhelpful and left in irritation.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, customers do have a right to expect correct pricing and amounts. The employee's actions were part of the problem. The author tried to address it calmly but got frustrated. Walking away is not illegal, but is it wrong? The author didn't escalate, which could be seen as reasonable. However, leaving the employee holding the meat without resolution might be considered poor customer conduct, but the employee was also at fault. \n\nThe story mentions the employee was confused and possibly made errors. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation. The question is about whether the author is the asshole for leaving without resolving it. The author's intent was just to buy groceries and not make a scene. They didn't cause harm, but they also didn't resolve the issue. \n\nIn similar situations, people often have different thresholds for dealing with customer service issues. The author's action of leaving might be seen as a personal choice rather than being in the wrong. The employee's mistakes contributed to the problem. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author had the right to leave if the situation was too frustrating, and the employee was part of the problem. However, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve it further. But given the details, the author's actions seem justified.\n"
