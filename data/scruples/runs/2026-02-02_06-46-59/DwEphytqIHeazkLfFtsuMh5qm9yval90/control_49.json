She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98. The employee slices it, asks if it's okay if it's a bit over, which the author agrees to. But then the bill comes to $12.18 for 1.745lbs at $6.98. The author points out the price discrepancy and weight. The employee says the price went up but didn't update the sign. The author points out the weight is over a pound, and the employee starts rebagging, putting only a few slices and cutting one. The author then leaves without dealing with her further.\n\nSo, the key points here. The employee made a mistake in pricing, either not updating the sign or charging the wrong price. The author correctly pointed out the error. The employee then tried to fix the weight by reducing the amount, which is problematic because the original request was for a pound, but they ended up with 1.75lbs. The employee's actions of rebagging and cutting slices might have been to adjust the weight to avoid overcharging, but it's unclear if that's the case. The author, frustrated by what seems like incompetence or dishonesty, leaves without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the employee made an error. The author tried to correct it politely. The employee then acted in a way that might have been trying to fix the weight but ended up giving less product for a higher price. The author's frustration is understandable. They didn't escalate the issue to a manager, but instead left, which the author justifies by not wanting to be a hassle. \n\nFrom a customer's perspective, it's reasonable to expect correct pricing and accurate weight. The employee's mistake led to confusion. The author's actions of pointing out the mistake were correct. However, leaving without addressing it further might be seen as not holding the store accountable. But the author argues they didn't want to be confrontational. \n\nThe employee was likely at fault for the pricing error and the mishandling of the product. The author's frustration is valid, but leaving without resolving it could be seen as not taking responsibility. However, the author didn't yell or cause a scene; they just left. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the employee is in the wrong for the mistake, but the author's reaction is a matter of personal choice. Since they didn't escalate, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might say they should have dealt with it. But given the tone of the story, the employee's response was unhelpful and the author's patience was lost. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
