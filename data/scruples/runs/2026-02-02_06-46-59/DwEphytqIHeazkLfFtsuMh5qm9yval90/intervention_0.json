She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a deli counter at a store. The person went to buy some meat, asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee made a mistake, pricing it at $6.98 per pound and giving almost 1.75 pounds instead of the requested 1lb. The customer pointed this out, the employee admitted the price change wasn't updated on the sign, and then there was some back and forth about the weight. The employee started reweighing by taking slices, tearing them, and the customer left without saying anything, leaving the employee confused.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They left without saying a word. They were irritated, didn't speak to the manager, and just walked out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLet's break it down. The employee made a mistake in both price and weight. The customer politely pointed out the price error and the weight being over. The employee tried to correct the weight by removing meat, but the customer was annoyed. The key here is whether the author's reaction was appropriate.\n\nThe customer has a right to question the price and weight. When the employee said the price had increased, the customer might have been confused but then noticed the weight was more than they asked for. The employee then tried to adjust the weight, but the method was perhaps haphazard (tearing slices), which could have frustrated the customer further.\n\nLeaving without saying anything\u2014could that be inconsiderate? The employee was already confused, and the customer didn't clarify the issue. The customer might have been annoyed, but walking out without resolving it could be seen as not standing up for oneself responsibly. However, the customer did try to address the issue initially and then left when it wasn't resolved satisfactorily. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong? Maybe not. The employee made a mistake, and the customer was trying to correct it. If the employee wasn't handling the correction properly, walking out might be a reaction to frustration. But the customer could have asked to speak to a manager, which is a standard way to resolve such issues. However, the customer didn't want to be \"that guy,\" so they left instead.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions left the employee confused and without closure. The employee might be left wondering what the problem was. But the customer's frustration is understandable given the employee's handling of the situation. The key points are whether the customer had a right to be upset and whether their action (leaving without word) was the wrong move.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is at fault for the pricing error and the employee's mishandling. The customer was within their rights to question the price and weight. By leaving, the customer didn't escalate the issue, which could leave the problem unresolved. However, the customer might have felt it wasn't worth the hassle. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. The customer isn't necessarily wrong for being frustrated, but leaving without resolution could be seen as not taking responsibility to address the issue properly. However, the employee's actions contributed to the problem. The answer might depend on cultural norms regarding customer service interactions. In some cases, leaving without a word could be seen as rude, especially if the employee was trying to fix the issue. But if the employee was being dismissive or not helpful, the customer might have a valid reason to leave.\n"
