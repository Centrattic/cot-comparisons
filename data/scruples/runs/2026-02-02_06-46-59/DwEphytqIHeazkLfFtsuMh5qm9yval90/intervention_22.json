She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author went to a deli, asked for 1 lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced the meat, asked if it's okay if it's a little over, the author agreed. Then the employee bags it, and the price is $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price has gone up but the sign wasn't changed. The author points out the weight is over a pound, the employee takes it back, cuts it down to just a few slices, and the author walks out without saying a word.\n\nSo, the key points here are the pricing discrepancy and the employee's handling of the situation. The author noticed the price was higher than the sign indicated and the weight was more than they asked for. The employee seems to be making a mistake in charging the higher price and possibly giving more product than necessary. \n\nThe author tried to point out the mistake politely but got frustrated. The employee then tried to correct it by reducing the amount of meat, but the author left without completing the transaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for walking out.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, when a customer points out a mistake, it's up to the employee to correct it. If the employee is charging the wrong price, the customer has the right to question that. However, the author's reaction was to walk out without further communication. The employee might have been confused or made a mistake, but the author could have waited for the corrected amount or asked to speak to a manager. By leaving, the author didn't resolve the issue and left the employee with the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the employee might have been defensive or unhelpful, which could justify the author's frustration. The situation escalated because the employee didn't handle it well, leading the author to lose patience. However, the author could have at least tried to resolve it further instead of just walking away. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is responsible for accurate pricing and weights. The employee made a mistake in charging the incorrect price and then adjusting the product without proper communication. The author was within their rights to point out the error. However, leaving without resolving the issue might be seen as abandoning the problem, which could be considered inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the mistake, but walking out without addressing it might be seen as inconsiderate. The answer depends on whether the author's actions are justified. If the employee was acting in good faith but made a mistake, the author could have waited for the corrected amount. However, if the employee was being dismissive, the author's frustration is understandable. The key is whether the author had a duty to resolve the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for being frustrated, but walking out without trying to resolve it further could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the employee's actions also contributed to the problem. The answer might be a bit of both, but the question is a binary choice. Since the author left the employee with the problem and didn't attempt to resolve it, that could be seen as inconsiderate, making the author in the wrong to some extent. But if the situation was so frustrating that it was reasonable to leave, then maybe not. I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they could have at least tried to resolve the issue further instead of leaving the employee in a difficult position.\n"
