She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a deli counter interaction. The person went to get turkey meat, asked for a pound at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them almost 1.75 pounds but charged $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee initially denied it, then tried to fix it by taking out slices and tearing them into halves to make it the right weight. The customer got fed up and left without saying anything.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, the customer noticed and pointed it out, the employee tried to correct the weight but not the price per pound. The customer left in frustration. \n\nFirst, the customer isn't at fault for noticing the mistake. The employee was the one who messed up the price. The customer was polite in pointing out the error. But when the employee tried to correct the weight, maybe they didn't actually fix the price per pound? If the customer left without resolving it, maybe they left the employee with meat but didn't pay the right amount. Wait, the employee was trying to rebag it as 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound, which is the same as the mistake. So the customer might not have accepted the corrected weight but left the employee with the problem. \n\nThe customer left the meat with the employee and walked out. So the question is whether the customer was wrong to not resolve it properly. Did they leave without paying the correct amount? If the employee was charging the wrong rate, the customer could have insisted on the correct price. But by leaving, the customer might not have ensured that the correct amount was paid. However, the customer might have thought that the employee was still charging the higher rate even after correcting the weight. \n\nAlternatively, the customer might have been in a hurry or frustrated and decided not to deal with it. But in terms of responsibility, the customer might have a point in trying to get the right price, but leaving without resolving it could be seen as abandoning the employee in a tricky situation. The employee might be stuck with the meat and no payment, or have to eat the loss. \n\nBut the customer's main issue is the price discrepancy and the incorrect weight. They were polite, tried to correct it, but when the employee didn't fix the price, they left. The employee might have been at fault for not correcting the price per pound, but the customer left without ensuring that the correct amount was paid. So maybe the customer is in the wrong because they didn't finish the transaction properly. But if the employee was still charging the wrong rate after correcting the weight, then the customer might have no obligation to stay. \n\nAlternatively, the customer could have left the meat and walked out, but maybe they should have at least communicated their intention to not proceed with the purchase if the price wasn't corrected. The customer left the employee holding the meat without saying a word, which might be the \"asshole\" part. So even if the employee was wrong, the customer's action of walking out without resolution might make them the asshole. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they left the situation unresolved and the employee in a difficult position, even if the employee made a mistake. They should have communicated their refusal to proceed properly rather than just leaving.\n"
