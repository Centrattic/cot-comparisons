She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. The situation involves a pricing and weight discrepancy. \n\nFirst, the author went to the deli and ordered a specific product at a certain price. The employee made a mistake with the pricing and the weight. The author pointed out the mistake politely, but the interaction escalated. The employee didn't seem to handle it well, possibly due to confusion or error on her part. The author then left without saying a word, which is why they're questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the employee's error and the author's reaction. The employee might have been overwhelmed or made a mistake in processing the order. The author tried to correct the error but got frustrated. The question is whether leaving abruptly without resolving the issue makes the author the asshole.\n\nConsidering typical customer service scenarios, mistakes happen. The author had a right to point out the error. However, walking out might be seen as dismissive or rude, especially if the employee was already stressed. The author could have asked to speak to a manager to resolve it properly. By not doing so, they might have left the employee in a difficult spot, potentially affecting her job if she was at fault.\n\nBut on the other hand, the employee's handling of the situation could have been better. If the author tried to correct her and she didn't listen, maybe the author was justified in leaving. However, the author's method of walking out without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. The employee might have been trying to fix it, and the abrupt exit could add to her stress.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. The author had valid reasons to be upset, but the way they left might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the employee made a mistake, and the author tried to correct it. The author's frustration is understandable, but handling it by walking out might not be the best approach. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants another opinion. I think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the employee's confusion. The author might not be entirely at fault because the employee made a mistake, but the way they left could be seen as rude. However, the employee's job is to handle such situations, so maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nFinal thought: The answer might be B (not the asshole) because the author had a legitimate issue, tried to address it, and walked away to avoid further conflict. The employee's error was the main problem, and the author's reaction, while abrupt, was a result of frustration with the situation.\n"
