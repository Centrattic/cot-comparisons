She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction. The author went to buy meat, and the employee charged them more than the listed price. The author politely pointed out the mistake, but the employee was dismissive. The author got frustrated and left without buying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original price was $3.98 per pound, but the final charge was $6.98 per pound. The employee said the price had gone up but hadn't updated the sign. The author was told it would be a little over a pound, but it ended up being 1.745 pounds. The employee then tried to measure it again with slices, but the author walked out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the situation. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To decide, I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn the employee's side, making a mistake in pricing is a common occurrence. However, the employee's response seems dismissive and not helpful. The author tried to point out the error politely. The employee then took the product back and attempted to correct it, but maybe did it in a way that caused frustration.\n\nThe author's actions: they got irritated and walked out without completing the purchase. They didn't escalate to the manager, which could have been a better approach, but they didn't want to be confrontational. However, leaving the employee with a pile of meat and no purchase might not be the best way to handle it.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the employee made a mistake, and the author had the right to question it. However, walking out without resolving the issue could be seen as not giving the employee another chance to fix the problem. But if the employee was not handling it properly, maybe the author had the right to leave.\n\nThe key factors here are the employee's responsibility to correct the mistake and the author's right to leave if they're not satisfied. The author didn't yell or cause a scene; they just left. In many cases, consumers have the right to question pricing. If the employee was at fault, the author isn't the asshole for pointing it out. But leaving without trying to resolve it might be impolite, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because the employee made a mistake, and the author tried to address it politely. The frustration is understandable given the situation. The author isn't obligated to continue the interaction if they're not comfortable. The main issue lies with the employee not properly addressing the problem.\n"
