She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. Hmm. So the situation is that the author went to buy some turkey meat. The deli girl made a mistake with the price and the weight. The author noticed the price was higher than expected and the weight was over a pound. The girl tried to fix it by taking some meat out, but the author got fed up and left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the author acted appropriately. The key points here are the mistake in pricing and the weight. The author pointed out the mistake politely, which is reasonable. The deli girl explained that the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated yet. That's a common issue, so maybe the author should have been understanding. However, the weight was over a pound, which the author was concerned about. The girl asked if it was okay if it was a little over, so the author agreed. But then she messed up the slicing and had to adjust the amount, which was confusing.\n\nNow, the author left without saying a word. The question is if that's wrong. The author was irritated and didn't want to escalate the situation by talking to the manager. But maybe they should have at least said something to the employee, even if they didn't go to the manager. The girl was trying to fix it, and leaving abruptly might have left her in an awkward position. However, the author might have felt that the process was taking too long and they wanted to avoid a confrontation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the deli made a mistake. The author wasn't the one at fault there. But the way they handled it\u2014leaving without a word\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they weren't wrong in their actions. So the answer might be B (Not the asshole) because the mistake was on the store's side, but the author's reaction could be seen as a bit hasty. However, the main issue is the store's error, not the author's actions. They did point out the mistake and tried to resolve it. The exit was abrupt, but maybe justified given the frustration. So probably B is correct.\n"
