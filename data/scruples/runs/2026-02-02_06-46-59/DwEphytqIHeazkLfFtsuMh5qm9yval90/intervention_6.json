She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a deli employee making a pricing error and the customer's reaction.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for oven-roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The employee made a mistake and charged $6.98 instead, ending up with over a pound. The customer pointed out the error, but the employee tried to justify it by saying the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, when the customer noted the weight was over a pound, the employee tried to adjust by taking some meat off, but the customer became irritated and left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the employee make a mistake, and was the customer justified in leaving without resolving the issue?\n\nThe employee admitted the price was higher but hadn't updated the sign, which is an error on their part. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight issue, the employee tried to adjust the amount, which might have been confusing. The customer, feeling frustrated, walked out. \n\nThe customer didn't engage further, didn't ask for a manager, and left the employee confused. The question is whether the customer was wrong for doing that. \n\nThe customer's main issue was the pricing and weight discrepancy. They were polite initially but became irritated. Walking out might be a reaction to frustration. However, the employee was incorrect in charging the higher price without updating the sign. The customer's right to point that out is valid. But leaving without resolving the issue might be seen as not holding the employee accountable, but maybe they just wanted to avoid a confrontation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the employee made a mistake, and the customer had the right to correct it. The customer's choice to leave instead of escalating might not be the wrong thing if they felt it wasn't worth the hassle. However, in some cases, it's expected to follow up to ensure the error is corrected. But the customer's frustration is understandable given the situation. \n\nSo, is the customer in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the customer left without addressing the pricing error despite pointing it out, maybe they could be seen as not taking it seriously. But since the employee was already adjusting the weight, perhaps the customer felt the issue was being handled, and the frustration came from the initial mistake. Alternatively, the customer might have been overwhelmed and chose to leave to de-escalate. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they left the situation unresolved after pointing out the error, which could have been addressed by speaking to a manager. However, another angle is that the employee was already correcting the weight, so the customer might have thought that was the resolution. But the pricing was still incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the customer might have been right to leave due to the stress of the situation. But from a retail perspective, not following up on a pricing error could be seen as complicit. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. The employee made the mistake, and the customer pointed it out. The customer left, not getting the correct price. So perhaps the customer is not in the wrong because they tried to address it and left when the employee was being uncooperative. \n\nWait, the employee said the price had gone up, even though the sign was wrong. So maybe the customer was correct in pointing out the discrepancy. The employee might be trying to cover up the error. So by leaving, the customer might be avoiding a conflict but also not getting the correct price. \n\nIn that case, maybe the customer is in the right (B) because the employee made the mistake, and the customer did address it and chose to walk away rather than escalate. The customer's frustration is valid. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
