She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli employee starts slicing and asks if it's okay if it's a bit over. The author agrees. Then the employee bags it, but the price is $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The author points out the mistake, the employee says the price increased but didn't update the sign. The author then points out the weight is over a pound, the employee checks with the customer, then starts rebagging by taking out slices, weighing them, and trying to correct the weight. The author gets frustrated, puts the basket down, and leaves without saying a word.\n\nSo, the main points here are the pricing error and the incorrect weight. The author was correct to notice that the price had changed and the weight was over. The employee admitted the price had gone up but didn't fix the sign. Then the author noticed the weight was over a pound, which the employee had previously asked if it was okay. The employee then started rebagging, but in a way that seems haphazard (taking a few slices, tearing one in half). The author, frustrated, left without dealing with the employee.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee made a mistake in pricing and then in the weight. The author tried to correct it politely. The employee's response about the price not being updated is a bit confusing. The author points out the weight issue, which the employee had previously mentioned. The employee's actions during rebagging seem incorrect, leading to the author's frustration. The author left without confrontation, but the question is whether that's the wrong thing to do.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store is responsible for accurate pricing and correct weights. The author is a customer, and it's reasonable to expect them to point out discrepancies. However, the author's reaction might be seen as abrupt by just leaving. But considering the employee's behavior\u2014starting to rebag in a confusing way, perhaps making the situation worse\u2014the author might feel it's not worth dealing with further. The author's frustration is understandable given the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the author isn't in the wrong because the mistakes were on the store's side. The author tried to address it but was met with unclear responses and then an improper rebagging. Walking away might be seen as a reasonable reaction to avoid further conflict or to not be \"that guy.\" Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
