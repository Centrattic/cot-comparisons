She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) in the situation described. The scenario involves a person at a deli counter who got charged a higher price than expected and then had an argument with the employee.\n\nFirst, the author asked for 1lb of turkey, which is priced at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745lbs, but charged $6.98 per pound. The author pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee explained the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author was confused because they were charged more despite getting more weight, but the price per pound was higher than what was advertised.\n\nThe employee then tried to adjust the amount by taking slices out, but the author left in frustration. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving without saying anything further.\n\nI need to consider the details. The employee admitted there was a pricing error, but the author was confused because the total ended up being higher even with more weight. The employee tried to fix it by reducing the amount, but maybe the author felt frustrated by the process. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were being overcharged, and the employee's explanation might not have been clear enough. The author might have felt that the employee was not resolving the issue properly, leading to their decision to leave. However, walking out without addressing the issue could be seen as not standing up for themselves or not seeking a proper resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, the employee might have been trying to correct the mistake, but the way they handled it (taking out slices, tearing them) could have been stressful for the author. The author might have felt disrespected or that the employee wasn't taking the issue seriously.\n\nThe key points are: was the author's action of leaving without further communication justified? Generally, when there's a billing error, it's reasonable to want to resolve it. However, if the employee was trying to correct the mistake and the author was too frustrated to continue, maybe the author is not entirely at fault. But the author also didn't follow up with a manager or another employee, which could have been a better course of action. So, the author might be in the wrong for not attempting to get a resolution, but the employee's handling of the situation could have been better too.\n\nBut according to the story, the employee was the one who made the mistake and tried to adjust it, but the author left. The author's actions could be seen as not wanting to deal with the hassle, which might be a valid response to a poor customer service experience. However, the author could have left a note or something instead of just walking out. \n\nIn the end, the author's choice to leave might be seen as not the asshole's fault because the employee's explanation was confusing and the situation was frustrating. The author's irritation is understandable, and walking out might be a reaction to poor service rather than being in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
