She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person went to the deli to buy some turkey meat. They asked for 1 pound at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 pounds but charged $6.98 per pound. The customer points this out, and the employee says the price went up but didn't change the sign. Then the employee tries to recut the meat by putting only a few slices and tearing one in half to make a smaller weight. The customer gets frustrated and leaves without saying anything.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the customer was wrong to just leave without resolving the situation. Let's break it down. First, the employee made a pricing error. The customer noticed and tried to correct it. The employee then adjusted the amount given but didn't fix the price. The customer was upset because they were being overcharged. They didn't confront the manager, just walked out.\n\nIs the customer wrong? Well, the employee was being uncooperative and trying to cover up the mistake. The customer's frustration is understandable. When someone is being charged a higher price without notice, and the staff isn't helping, it's reasonable to get upset. However, leaving without resolving it might be seen as not giving the store a chance to fix it. But the customer did try to address the issue, and the employee was dismissive. In such cases, people do have the right to leave if they feel they're being treated unfairly. The customer isn't an asshole for standing up for themselves when the store isn't being transparent. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
