She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli counter where there was a pricing error and some confusion.\n\nFirst, the author ordered 1lb of turkey meat, which is priced at $3.98 per pound. The deli worker gave them 1.745 pounds, but charged $6.98 per pound, making the total $12.18. The worker explains that the price has gone up but the sign wasn't updated. The author points out the weight discrepancy, and the worker starts slicing the meat to get the correct weight. The worker tears a slice in half to get the right amount, which seems odd. The author then leaves without saying anything, feeling frustrated.\n\nNow, the key points here are the pricing mistake and the weight discrepancy. The customer noticed both issues and tried to address them politely. The worker was dismissive, which led to the author losing patience. The author didn't confront the manager but walked out instead.\n\nFrom a customer's perspective, it's reasonable to expect accurate pricing and correct weight. The store made errors in both. The worker's explanation that the sign wasn't updated is an internal error they should handle. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially since the worker was unhelpful. The author's actions might be seen as a last resort after trying to resolve the issue but being met with uncooperative behavior.\n\nHowever, walking out without saying a word could be seen as abrupt. The author might have been justified in their frustration but could have tried to speak with a manager if the worker wasn't helpful. But given the worker's actions (tearing the meat, which might be unhygienic or just odd), the author's decision to leave might be a reasonable reaction to the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the store is at fault for the pricing error. The author is not in the wrong for pointing out the mistake. The way they handled it could be debated, but given the worker's response, their frustration is valid. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
