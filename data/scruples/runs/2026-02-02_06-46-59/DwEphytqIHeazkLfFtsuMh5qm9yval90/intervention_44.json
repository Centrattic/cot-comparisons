She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli worker who charged the wrong price and weight for the turkey meat.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1 lb at $3.98/lb. The employee gave 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is way over the price. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee claimed the price had increased but didn't update the sign. The customer got frustrated when the employee took out the meat and tried to repackage it with only a few slices, which seemed like an attempt to fix the weight but still charge more. The customer left without saying anything else.\n\nNow, the key points here: The employee made a pricing error. The customer noticed and tried to correct it. The employee's response was confusing\u2014they said the price increased but didn't adjust the weight. Then, when the customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, the employee tried to repackage it by taking out slices. This could be seen as the employee trying to correct the weight but not the price, or maybe not understanding the issue. The customer, frustrated by the employee's actions and lack of resolution, left without further confrontation.\n\nThe question is whether the customer is in the wrong for leaving without resolving the issue. The customer's actions: they tried to point out the mistake, were polite, but when the employee didn't handle it properly, they lost patience and left. The customer didn't escalate to a manager or argue further. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the customer had a valid reason to notice the error. The employee was at fault for the initial mistake. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially if they felt the employee wasn't addressing the issue correctly. Leaving without a confrontation isn't necessarily wrong, especially if they felt there was no point in continuing. However, some might argue that the customer should have tried to resolve it by speaking to a manager. But given the employee's confusion and the customer's possible irritation, it's a hard call.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. Considering the employee's error and the customer's attempt to correct it, the customer isn't entirely at fault. However, the customer could have handled it more politely or escalated if necessary. The main issue is the employee's responsibility for the mistake and not being able to resolve it. The customer's reaction, while abrupt, might be justified given the employee's confusing response. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's close. The customer's choice to leave doesn't make them the asshole if the employee was unhelpful. So I think the answer is B.\n"
