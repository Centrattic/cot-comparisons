She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer feels overcharged and leaves the employee confused.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee made it over a pound, but charged at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, but the employee was dismissive and even more confusing. The customer got frustrated and left without finishing the interaction.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the employee made an error in pricing and weight. The customer tried to point out the mistake politely. The employee didn't acknowledge it and even acted confused. The customer lost patience and left, not saying a word.\n\nThe question is whether the customer is in the wrong. Well, the customer was correct in pointing out the error. The employee's response was unhelpful. The customer didn't attack the employee, just left after being told that the price had gone up without the sign changing, which is a bit strange. The customer's frustration is understandable given the situation. However, leaving without resolving it could be seen as not being fair to the employee. But given the employee's behavior, maybe the customer felt justified.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the customer isn't at fault because the mistake was on the employee's side. The customer tried to address it calmly but the employee's response escalated the issue. The customer's decision to leave might be a bit abrupt, but it's a reaction to poor customer service. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
