She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. Let's start by looking at the situation.\n\nThe author went to the deli to buy oven roasted turkey meat. They asked for 1lb at $3.98 per pound. The deli employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is more expensive. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee initially said the price had gone up but hadn't changed the sign. Then, when the author mentioned the weight being over a pound, the employee took the meat back and tried to re-weigh it by cutting slices. The author got frustrated and left without saying anything.\n\nSo, first, the employee made a pricing error. The price tag was wrong, and the weight was more than the requested amount. The author is correct in pointing out both the price and weight issues. The employee's response was to try to justify the higher price and then correct the weight by removing some meat. The author's frustration is understandable here because they were being overcharged both in weight and price per pound.\n\nThe key points are whether the author acted inappropriately. The author tried to resolve the issue politely but became irritated when the employee didn't address both issues. The employee's actions of re-weighing by cutting slices might have been confusing or unsatisfactory, leading the author to leave. Since the employee didn't resolve the issue and the author didn't escalate it further (like asking for a manager), the author's decision to leave seems reasonable given the circumstances. The employee was in the wrong for the pricing error and not properly addressing the customer's concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving, as they were trying to get a fair price and weren't abusive. The answer should be B.\n"
