She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who went to a deli and ended up leaving in frustration because there was a pricing discrepancy and some confusing handling of the meat.\n\nFirst, the user ordered oven-roasted turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee sliced it, asked if it was okay if it was a bit over a pound, and the customer agreed. But then the total came out to over $12 for 1.7 pounds at $6.98 per pound. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. The customer then got more annoyed when the employee took the meat back, took out slices, and tried to adjust the weight by cutting slices into halves. Finally, the customer just left without saying a word, leaving the employee confused.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The customer noticed a mistake in pricing and weight and pointed it out politely. The employee didn't immediately correct it, which might have been the store's error. However, when the employee tried to adjust the weight by cutting slices, maybe that was causing confusion or not addressing the core issue of the price discrepancy. The customer, frustrated, left without further confrontation. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the customer act appropriately when they noticed the error? The customer tried to point out the mistake, but the employee didn't correct it. The customer's frustration led them to leave instead of escalating to a manager. Is leaving the scene without resolving the issue considered wrong? On one hand, you could argue that the customer didn't handle it calmly and might have caused the employee to be left in an awkward situation. On the other hand, the customer might feel that the employee wasn't resolving the issue, so walking out was their way of dealing with the stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the store's mistake in pricing and not updating the sign is on them. The employee might not have known about the price change. The customer's frustration is understandable because they were charged more than expected. However, the customer could have spoken to a manager instead of just leaving. By leaving without addressing it, the customer didn't give the store the chance to correct the mistake. \n\nBut was the customer in the wrong for leaving? Maybe not. They were entitled to the correct price. The employee's actions didn't resolve the pricing issue, just the weight. So the core problem (price) wasn't addressed. The customer might have felt that further discussion would be unproductive, hence leaving. However, leaving without a word might not be the best approach, but it's not necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense. The customer's actions are more about personal frustration than malicious intent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They tried to correct the issue but left when it wasn't resolved. However, some might argue that they could have handled it better by speaking to a manager. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If \"wrong\" means being morally at fault, maybe not. They were a customer facing a mistake and handled it in a way that suited their stress level. The employee's confusion is more on the store's part for the error. So I think the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
