She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli counter interaction where the customer, the author, ends up leaving without resolving the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author goes to the deli, asks for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The employee slices it and asks if being a bit over is okay. The author agrees. Then the bagged meat is priced at $6.98/lb for 1.75lbs, totaling $12.18. The author points out the mistake, but the employee says the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. The author then gets the weight issue, and the employee starts re-slicing, putting 2 slices and half another, which seems too little. The author then leaves, not speaking to a manager.\n\nNow, who's at fault here? The employee made a pricing and weight error. The author tried to point it out politely. The employee's response was dismissive and then started to re-slice, which might be a way to make up the weight but the method seems questionable. The author, frustrated, leaves without further action.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the employee was incorrect on both price and weight. The author's reaction was to leave out of frustration. While not resolving the issue could be seen as not standing up for oneself, the situation escalated due to the employee's unprofessionalism. The author might have been right to leave given the employee's confusing handling of the situation. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
