She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is at a deli, asks for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gives them 1.745 lbs but charges $6.98/lb. The customer points out the discrepancy, the employee says the price has gone up but the sign wasn't changed. The customer is frustrated when the employee then takes out the meat, starts rebagging, and the customer leaves without saying anything.\n\nFirst, the employee made a pricing error. The customer was correct in pointing out the weight and price. The employee's response that the price increased but the sign wasn't updated might be valid, but not explaining that clearly is an issue. Then, when the customer is confused about the weight being over a pound, the employee questions the customer's knowledge of the weight label, which is unprofessional and could be seen as dismissive. The employee then starts rebagging with fewer slices, which might not actually correct the price. The customer, feeling disrespected and frustrated, leaves.\n\nThe customer's reaction is a bit strong. They could have asked to speak to a manager or at least clarified further, but the employee's behavior was unprofessional and confusing. The customer's frustration is understandable, but walking out without addressing it might not be the best approach. However, the employee's actions were the root cause. So, is the customer in the wrong? They made a valid point, but their response was abrupt. The employee is more at fault here. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
