She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The person went to a deli, asked for a specific amount and price, but the employee messed up the pricing and weight. The person tried to point out the error, but the employee was uncooperative. In the end, they left without finishing the transaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author was a customer who was charged more than expected. The deli employee made an error in pricing and weight. The customer tried to address it politely, but the employee didn't handle it well. The customer got frustrated and left without resolving the issue.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the customer act appropriately when confronted with the error? The customer didn't confront the employee aggressively. They pointed out the mistake, but when the employee was uncooperative, they decided to leave. The user is asking if the customer was wrong to do that.\n\nIn terms of store policies, if there's a pricing error, the customer has the right to dispute it. However, the employee's job is to resolve such issues. The customer might be within their rights to leave if they're not comfortable with how the situation is being handled. The employee's behavior could have been more professional, like offering to correct the mistake or escalating to a manager.\n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable. They were overcharged and given a larger quantity than requested. The employee's response, such as not acknowledging the weight issue and handling the meat in a way that seemed dismissive, likely escalated the situation. The customer's decision to leave might be seen as a reasonable reaction to the employee's poor customer service.\n\nBut was the customer in the wrong? They didn't confront the employee further, didn't yell or cause a scene. They simply left after the employee didn't address the mistake properly. So, the customer isn't at fault here. The employee made the error and didn't handle the customer's concerns adequately. The customer's actions were a response to being mistreated, not the initial problem.\n"
