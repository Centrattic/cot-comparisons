She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author goes to the deli and asks for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98 per lb. The employee starts slicing and says it's okay if it's a bit over. The author then points out the price was wrong\u2014it was actually $6.98 per lb, and the weight is over 1.7 lbs. They politely mention the mistake, but the employee insists the price is correct. The author is frustrated when the employee doesn't acknowledge the price discrepancy and the weight. The employee then starts cutting the meat into very thin slices, which makes the author lose patience and leave without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points here: the employee made a pricing error. The author tried to correct it politely. The employee didn't acknowledge the mistake and instead focused on the weight, even though the price per pound was wrong. The author got frustrated and left. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they tried to address the issue, but when the employee didn't correct it, frustration led them to walk out. The author didn't escalate the situation by talking to a manager, which they considered. The employee was incorrect in the pricing and didn't correct it, leading to the author's decision to leave. \n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to poor customer service. They didn't act aggressively or be rude; they just got fed up and left. The employee's mistake was significant, and the author's patience was lost. So, the answer is B\u2014author isn't in the wrong. They had a right to be upset about the pricing error and the employee's unhelpful response.\n"
