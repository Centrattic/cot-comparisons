She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl in confusion after a pricing dispute.\n\nFirst, the author went to the deli and asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee gave them 1.745lbs priced at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the discrepancy. The employee said the price had gone up but didn't update the sign. Then, the author questioned the weight, and the employee took the meat, rebagged it with only a few slices, making the weight much less. \n\nThe author got frustrated, put their basket down, and left without saying a word. The key points here are whether the author's actions were justified. The employee made a pricing error and then tried to correct the weight by taking out most of the meat, which might not be fair to the customer. The author was trying to get the correct price they were quoted. \n\nThe employee's behavior seems unprofessional, especially not updating the sign and then removing most of the product. The author's frustration is understandable. However, walking out without any communication could be seen as rude. But given the employee's actions, maybe the author felt there was no resolution. \n\nThe author didn't escalate to a manager, which they could have done. But they might have felt it was a waste of time. The main question is whether the author was wrong. The employee made mistakes, so the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
