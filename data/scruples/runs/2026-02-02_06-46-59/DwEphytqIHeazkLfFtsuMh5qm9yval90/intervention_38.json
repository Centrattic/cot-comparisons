She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli counter in a huff after a pricing error. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author went to the deli, ordered 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee made a mistake, charged $6.98/lb for 1.745 lbs. The author noticed, pointed it out, and the employee tried to correct it by removing slices. The author then left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the main points here are the employee's error and the author's reaction. The employee messed up the price and the weight. The author tried to correct it politely, but when the employee took the meat, started reweighing, and tried to give a smaller amount, the author lost patience and left.\n\nNow, considering the employee's actions: They didn't correct the price to $3.98 as originally stated. Instead, they changed the price to $6.98, which was higher than the original $3.98. That's a problem. The author is correct to point that out. The employee then tried to adjust the weight by taking out slices, but the total weight was still over a pound. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014they expected a specific price and amount.\n\nThe author's reaction was to leave without further engagement. The question is: Was that wrong? Well, the employee was in the wrong by charging the higher price. The author tried to correct it but when the employee didn't resolve it properly, their patience broke. Walking out might be seen as not helpful, but the author didn't engage in a confrontation or yell. They just left. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the employee made the mistake. The author's actions were a reaction to poor customer service. However, the author could have spoken to a manager to resolve the issue. But since they didn't want to be \"that guy,\" they left. Is that acceptable? It's a judgment call. The author isn't in the wrong for being frustrated, but maybe they could have handled it more constructively. However, given the employee's incorrect actions, the author had a right to be upset.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The employee made the error, and the author tried to address it. The author's reaction was extreme but not entirely unreasonable given the situation. So the answer is B (No).\n"
