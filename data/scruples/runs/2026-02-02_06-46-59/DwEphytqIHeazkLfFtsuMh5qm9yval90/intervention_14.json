She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So the situation is about a deli worker who messed up the price and weight of the meat. The customer points out the mistake, the worker corrects it, but the customer walks out in frustration. \n\nFirst, the deli girl made an error. She priced the turkey at $6.98 instead of $3.98 and gave almost 1.75 pounds instead of 1 pound. The customer points out the mistake politely. The worker says the price increased but didn't update the sign, which is a valid reason. Then the customer says the weight is wrong. The worker checks, maybe didn't clarify properly, then starts to correct it by taking the meat apart.\n\nNow, the customer is irritated and leaves without saying anything. The key question is whether this is the customer's fault. The customer could have asked to speak to a manager or waited for the corrected amount. But the worker was being unprofessional in her responses, maybe not clarifying enough. The customer's frustration is understandable, but walking out without a word might be seen as leaving the worker in the lurch, especially since she was trying to fix it. However, the initial mistake was hers, so the customer had a valid reason to be upset. \n\nIs the customer wrong for not dealing with the situation? If the worker was trying to correct it, leaving might be abrupt. But the customer's main goal was to buy groceries, and if they didn't want to deal with the hassle, maybe it's not their fault. The worker's mistake set the tone. However, the customer could have handled it more politely instead of walking out. Still, the worker's actions were the root cause. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to be polite but gave up due to irritation. The answer might be B.\n"
