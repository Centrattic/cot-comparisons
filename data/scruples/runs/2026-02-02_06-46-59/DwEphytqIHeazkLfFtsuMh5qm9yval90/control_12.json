She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a deli counter where the customer gets charged more than expected because of a pricing error.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb. The deli employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged them at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the employee tried to adjust the weight by taking out slices, but the customer got frustrated and left without paying.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether the customer had a right to leave without paying and if their reaction was justified. The customer initially caught the error, which is reasonable. The employee's response might not have been correct. If the price was actually $6.98/lb, the sign should be updated, but the customer was being charged double the price they were told. The employee then tried to fix the weight instead of addressing the price discrepancy.\n\nThe customer got fed up and left. But if they left without paying, that's stealing, right? Because they didn't settle the payment. The author mentions leaving the basket and walking out. If they didn't pay anything and left the item, that's definitely wrong. However, if they tried to return the item and left, maybe it's different. Wait, the customer was given the wrong price and wrong weight. The employee tried to correct the weight but not the price. The customer might have thought they were being overcharged in both weight and price. But the correct action would be to either pay the correct amount for the correct weight or return the item. If the customer left without paying, that's theft. But if they returned the item and left, maybe not. The narrative isn't entirely clear, but the customer's shopping basket is mentioned as being put down, perhaps implying they left the meat there. If they left the meat and didn't take it, then they didn't steal. But if they took the meat and left without paying, then yes.\n\nThe author says they \"just walked out the door\" after putting the basket down. If they left the basket with the meat at the store, then they didn't take the meat home. So they didn't steal. Therefore, the author's action was leaving the item behind and walking out, which isn't stealing. However, the employee might have overcharged due to an error. The customer's frustration led them to abandon the transaction. But is it the customer's fault? The employee made a mistake in pricing and then tried to adjust the weight instead of addressing the price increase. The customer's reaction, while abrupt, might be justified given the confusion and the employee's incorrect handling of the situation. The customer didn't confront the manager, which could have resolved it, but they were frustrated. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but perhaps should have resolved it properly instead of leaving. But if they didn't take the meat, then leaving isn't theft. So the answer might be B (No), because the author didn't take the item home and was pointing out a mistake. The employee's actions were at fault here.\n"
