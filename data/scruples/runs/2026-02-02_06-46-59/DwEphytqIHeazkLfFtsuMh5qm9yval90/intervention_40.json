She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where the customer left without resolving the pricing error.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The customer asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb, thinly sliced. The employee gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, which is over $12 total. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee initially denied, then took it back and tried to fix it by putting 2 slices and halving another, but the customer just walked out without saying anything else.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. So I need to weigh both sides. The customer had a right to be concerned about overcharging. The price sign was wrong, and the employee might have made an honest mistake. The customer was polite when pointing out the error, but the employee was dismissive and didn't acknowledge the mistake immediately. \n\nWhen the employee tried to fix it by rebagging, perhaps the customer felt it wasn't a proper resolution. The customer left the basket and walked out, which could be seen as rude or impolite. The customer might have been stressed or frustrated, but is walking out the appropriate response? \n\nOn the other hand, the employee's behavior might have been part of the problem. If they were defensive and didn't handle the situation well, maybe the customer's patience ran out. The customer didn't escalate to the manager, which some might argue is a valid step, but others might say that leaving without resolving could be the customer's fault. \n\nThe question is whether the customer was wrong for leaving abruptly. The employee was trying to correct the mistake, but the customer might have felt that the employee wasn't being transparent or that the process was too slow. However, the customer could have at least thanked the employee or left a note instead of just walking out. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the customer acted inconsiderately. Since the employee was in the process of correcting the issue, the customer walking out without communication might be the asshole. But maybe the employee's initial mistake and handling made the customer act that way. \n\nI need to decide if the customer's action was justified. The customer was polite when pointing out the error, but the employee's response was dismissive. The customer might have felt like there was no point in staying, but not saying anything at all is rude. The answer could be A (customer is in the wrong) because they left without resolution or communication, but some might argue the employee's fault for the mistake. However, the question is about the customer's actions. \n\nI think the answer is A. The customer left without any explanation, which is impolite. Even if the employee was at fault, the customer's response is what's being judged here. Walking out in that way without at least expressing their concerns to a manager or leaving a note might be considered the asshole behavior.\n"
