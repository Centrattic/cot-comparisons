She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without speaking. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author went to the deli and asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, mentioned it might be a bit over, and then charged over $6 per pound. The author pointed out the price mistake and the incorrect weight. The employee tried to explain the price increase and the weight discrepancy. The author got irritated when the employee didn't seem to understand the weight issue and left without finishing the transaction.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the price discrepancy and the incorrect weight. The employee made a mistake in pricing, applying the higher rate without updating the sign. Also, the weight was over a pound. The author tried to correct her politely but got frustrated when the employee didn't grasp the weight issue. Then the employee started rebagging, which might have been a mistake again\u2014putting only 2 slices and half another, which seems like under 1lb. The author left, not wanting to deal with it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to correct the mistake, but when things didn't go smoothly, they left. The employee might have been in a confusing situation, possibly overwhelmed. But the author's frustration is understandable. However, walking out without addressing it completely could be seen as not standing up for oneself properly. On the other hand, the employee's actions (like tearing the slice) might have annoyed the author further. The author didn't confront the manager, which could have resolved the issue. But maybe the author felt it wasn't worth the hassle. It's a bit of a gray area. The employee made mistakes, but the author's response might have been abrupt. I think there's a case for both sides. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The employee was confused, but the author could have handled it more patiently. Alternatively, the employee's actions might have justified the author's frustration. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the employee made multiple errors and wasn't helpful. So the answer might be B (No). But maybe the author should have at least tried to speak to the manager. Hmm. The user is asking if the author is wrong, and the options are A (Yes) or B (No). I think the answer is B because the main issue was the store's mistake, and the author's reaction, while abrupt, is understandable given the confusion and errors.\n"
