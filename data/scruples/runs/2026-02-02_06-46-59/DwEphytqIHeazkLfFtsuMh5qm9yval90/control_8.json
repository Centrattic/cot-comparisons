She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author went to the deli to buy turkey meat. They asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound, thinly sliced. The employee made a mistake by charging $6.98 per pound and gave almost two pounds. The author pointed out the price discrepancy, the employee corrected the price but then disputed the weight. The author got frustrated, the employee tried to fix it by taking out some meat, but the author left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error, the author noticed and tried to correct it, but then the employee was dismissive or incorrect in their response. The author's frustration led them to walk out.\n\nNow, considering the employee's actions. She initially charged the wrong price and gave more product than requested. When the author pointed out the weight was over a pound, she didn't seem to handle it well. She took the product, checked the weight, but then tried to rebag it by cutting slices to meet the weight. The author found this unprofessional and left.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, when the author realized the mistake, they tried to point it out politely. The employee's responses were incorrect or dismissive. The author got irritated, which is understandable given the situation. However, walking out without saying a word might have left the employee confused, but from the author's perspective, they were trying to avoid a confrontation. The employee's actions were the initial problem here\u2014charging the wrong price and then not properly addressing the weight issue. The author's main issue was the employee's incorrect pricing and handling of the situation. The author's frustration is justified because they were paying more than intended and getting more product than they wanted. The employee's actions led to the problem, so the author leaving in frustration might not be their fault. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently by speaking to a manager or at least informing the employee that they were leaving. But in the heat of the moment, maybe they weren't in the right frame of mind. \n\nBut considering the employee's actions, it's possible the store made an error, and the employee didn't handle it correctly. The author's response was a reaction to the employee's mistakes. So, in terms of right and wrong, the mistake was on the employee's side. However, the author's choice to leave abruptly might have been inconsiderate to the employee, who was left confused. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. If the author is wrong, it would be because they didn't communicate their intent to leave, causing confusion. But if the employee was at fault for the initial mistake, the author's actions are a result of that. \n\nIn many cases, when someone makes a mistake, the person pointing it out isn't in the wrong. The employee here was the one who messed up the price and then didn't handle it properly. The author's frustration is valid, and their decision to leave, while possibly abrupt, might not make them the asshole. However, maybe they could have done better by not leaving without a word. But given the employee's incorrect responses and the author's desire to avoid conflict, it's understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The employee was at fault, and the author's actions were a reaction to that. The confusion left to the employee is a consequence of the situation, but the primary fault lies with the employee's mistakes.\n"
