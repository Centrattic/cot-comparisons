She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went to buy deli meat. The employee made a pricing error, charging $6.98 per pound instead of $3.98. The author pointed this out politely. The employee then had to adjust the weight to match the incorrect total. The author got frustrated with the process and left without resolving the issue.\n\nNow, let's consider both sides. The employee made a mistake, which is understandable. However, the author did point out the error in a polite manner. The employee's response about the price change might have been confusing, leading to further issues with the weight. The author's frustration is valid because they were being overcharged and the process was taking time. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's reaction was appropriate. The author chose to leave instead of escalating the issue, which could be seen as a reasonable response given their frustration. However, leaving without resolving the matter might have left the employee in an awkward position, possibly without knowing how to correct the error. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, they were dealing with an incorrect charge and a confusing process. Their irritation is justified, and walking away might be a way to avoid a confrontation. The employee's job is to handle such situations, so the author isn't entirely at fault for not dealing with the stress of the situation. \n\nOn the flip side, the author could have asked to speak to a manager or at least communicated their intention to leave. However, the story states that the author didn't want to be \"that guy\" causing a scene, so walking out was a way to avoid further conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while abrupt, are a result of being overcharged and frustrated with the process. The employee's mistake and the subsequent handling of the situation contributed to the author's decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving the way they did. The answer should be B.\n"
