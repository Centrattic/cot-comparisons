She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter interaction where there was a pricing and weight discrepancy.\n\nFirst, the author went to buy turkey meat at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs at $6.98 per pound. The author pointed out the mistake, and the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then, the author was upset about the weight being over a pound, and the employee tried to fix it by cutting slices. The author left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the author acted appropriately. The employee made a mistake in pricing, which is on the store. The author tried to point out the issue but got frustrated with the employee's handling. The employee's response about the sign not being updated might be valid, but the weight issue is also a problem. The author left without confronting the manager or resolving it, which could be seen as abandoning the employee to handle it. However, the employee might have been in over their head, and the author's frustration is understandable given the confusion and incorrect billing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't physically harm anyone or yell, just walked out. They tried to communicate the issue, but when the employee started redoing the order, maybe the author could have waited for the manager. But walking out might not be the asshole move here. The employee's actions might have contributed to the author's decision. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong because the store made a mistake and the employee didn't handle it well.\n"
