She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a deli counter where the customer got charged a higher price than expected and ended up leaving without resolving it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb, but the deli employee gave them 1.745lbs at $6.98/lb. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee said the price had increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then there was a dispute over the weight. The customer got frustrated and left without further action.\n\nSo, let's consider the responsibilities here. The customer's main issue was being charged a higher price than the sign indicated. The employee admitted the price had gone up but didn't change the sign. That's on the store's part\u2014they should have accurate signage. The customer is within their right to question the price discrepancy.\n\nThen there's the weight issue. The customer asked for a pound, and the total was 1.745lbs. The employee allowed it to be a bit over, but then the customer pointed out the weight. The employee tried to fix it by taking out slices, but the customer was upset with the handling. The customer's frustration is understandable because they were being overcharged both in price and weight.\n\nNow, the customer left without confronting the manager. The employee might have made errors, but the customer's approach was to just walk out. Is that the customer's fault? Well, the customer has the right to challenge incorrect charges. But the way they handled it\u2014leaving without trying to resolve it\u2014could be seen as not taking responsibility to address the issue properly. However, the employee's behavior (tearing meat, not providing clear info) also contributed to the problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the store is at fault for incorrect pricing and weight. The customer, while frustrated, had a legitimate reason to question the charges. Not speaking to a manager might prevent the issue from being resolved, but the customer's impatience is understandable given the situation. The main question is if the customer is in the wrong for leaving. Since the store made the error, the customer isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves, even if they didn't follow up. But if the customer didn't try to resolve it, maybe that's a minor fault. However, the primary responsibility for the error is the store's, so the answer might lean towards the customer not being in the wrong.\n"
