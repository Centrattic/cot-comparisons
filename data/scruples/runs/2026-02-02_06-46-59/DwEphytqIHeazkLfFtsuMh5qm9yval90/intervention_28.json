She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The situation involves a pricing error and the customer's reaction.\n\nFirst, the deli girl made a mistake by charging the higher price of $6.98 per pound instead of the $3.98 listed. The customer politely pointed this out, which is reasonable. The girl then tried to fix it by rebagging, but the customer was irritated and walked out. \n\nThe customer's main argument is that they lost patience and didn't want to escalate by asking for the manager. They felt the interaction was frustrating and just wanted to buy groceries. However, the deli girl had already acknowledged the error and was in the process of correcting it. The customer didn't give her a chance to resolve the issue fully, and left before the transaction was completed. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the customer wrong? Well, they did confront the employee politely first, which is the right step. The employee made a mistake and was trying to correct it, but the customer, due to irritation, didn't stick around. The customer's action might be seen as abrupt, but they were trying to avoid confrontation. On the other hand, the employee might need the customer's presence to finish the transaction properly. \n\nThe key points are: the customer tried to address the issue respectfully, the employee was correcting the mistake, but the customer left before the issue was resolved. The customer might have been in a hurry or had enough, but leaving without any communication could cause confusion. The deli girl might be left in an awkward position, not knowing if she should put the meat back or charge the correct price. \n\nHowever, the customer's primary responsibility is to ensure they're charged correctly. Since they did point out the error and the employee was handling it, the customer might have a right to leave if they felt the situation was under control. But maybe they should have waited a moment to confirm the correction. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's generally considered good to resolve the issue with the employee or at least inform them if you're leaving. The customer didn't do that, which is why the deli girl was left confused. So, the author might be at fault for not communicating properly even after the employee was addressing the mistake. \n\nBut the employee's response could have been better too. Taking out the meat and starting to rebag might have made the customer feel like it's taking too long. Still, the customer's exit without any explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. They didn't say they were leaving because they didn't want to be \"that guy,\" but leaving without a word might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the customer had a right to be upset about the pricing error and tried to address it. The employee made a mistake and was correcting it. The customer's action of walking out was abrupt and left the employee in an awkward spot. However, the customer's intention wasn't to be malicious but to avoid further conflict. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the action's impact on others. The customer's exit without communication might be seen as wrong because it's confusing and unprofessional. The employee might be left unsure if the customer is coming back or if the issue is resolved. Therefore, the customer should have at least informed the employee before leaving.\n"
