She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli where there was a pricing mistake, and the employee handled it poorly. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli girl gave them 1.745lbs but charged $6.98/lb, which is way more expensive. The customer pointed out the mistake. The employee initially said the price had gone up but hadn't updated the sign. Then the customer mentioned the weight being over a pound, and the employee seemed confused, asking where that was stated. The customer got irritated, the employee took the meat, but then cut slices and re-bagged it. The customer then left without saying anything else.\n\nSo, the employee made a pricing and weighing error. The customer tried to correct it politely but the employee was uncooperative and possibly incorrect. The customer then left in frustration. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe main issue here is how the customer handled the conflict. The customer was polite initially, pointed out the mistake, but the employee didn't address it correctly. The employee then started to repackage the meat in a way that seemed like another error. The customer lost patience and left. \n\nIs leaving without further confrontation wrong? Well, the customer had the right to question the pricing and weight. The employee's behavior was unprofessional, and the customer didn't escalate the issue further than pointing out the mistake. Walking out could be seen as a reasonable reaction to an uncooperative employee, especially if the customer felt it would take too long to resolve or didn't want to argue. \n\nIn some cases, people might say the customer should have gone to the manager, but the customer admitted they didn't want to be that person. However, the employee's actions (not correcting the price, not properly addressing the weight) were the main issues. The customer wasn't necessarily in the wrong for not dealing with the situation further, especially given the employee's response. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the customer was trying to address a legitimate mistake, and the employee was at fault for the errors and poor handling of the situation. The customer's reaction, while abrupt, was a result of the employee's unresponsiveness and the customer's frustration with the unnecessary hassle.\n"
