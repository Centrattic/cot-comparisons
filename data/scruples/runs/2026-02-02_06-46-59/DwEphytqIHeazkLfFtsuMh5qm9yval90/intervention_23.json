She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a customer at a deli counter. The person ordered 1 lb of turkey meat at $3.98 per pound but was given a bag that cost $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98. The employee initially said the price had increased but hadn't updated the sign. The customer tried to point out the weight discrepancy, but the employee was dismissive, leading the customer to walk out without finishing the interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The customer noticed a mistake in price and weight. The employee might have made an error, either in pricing or in the amount of meat given. The customer tried to bring it up politely, but the employee was uncooperative. The customer then left in frustration without resolving the issue.\n\nThe main question is whether the customer was wrong to leave without word. The customer's actions could be seen as abandoning the employee, which might not be professional. But considering the employee's dismissive behavior and the customer's frustration, maybe the customer had a reason to walk out. However, leaving without addressing it properly could mean the mistake isn't corrected, and the customer might end up paying more or the store might lose money if the customer didn't pay correctly.\n\nBut in the story, the customer didn't pay at all and just left. So the customer didn't pay for the meat. If the customer left without paying, that's theft. However, the customer was trying to correct a pricing error. But in the end, the customer left the bag, so maybe they didn't take the meat. Wait, the story says the employee put the rebagged meat into a new bag and tried to hand it to the customer, but the customer walked out. So the customer didn't take the meat, just left the store. But the customer didn't pay, so perhaps the customer is in the wrong for not completing the transaction.\n\nAlternatively, if the customer was trying to correct the error and the employee was unhelpful, maybe the customer's frustration is understandable. But the right action would be to speak to a manager or not purchase until the issue is resolved. The customer's choice to walk out might be impolite but not necessarily wrong if the customer decided not to proceed with the purchase due to the employee's uncooperative attitude. However, not paying for the item would be wrong. But in this case, the customer didn't take the meat, so maybe it's more about not completing the transaction properly.\n\nSo, the customer might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue by speaking to a manager or for not ensuring the correct payment. However, if the customer felt that the employee was incorrect and decided not to proceed, they aren't necessarily at fault. But the act of leaving without resolving it could be seen as irresponsible. The answer might depend on whether the customer actually took the product without paying. If the customer left the product behind, then maybe they aren't at fault. But if they left without paying, that's theft. But in the story, the customer walked out, and the employee had already bagged the meat, so it's unclear if the customer paid or not. The story says the customer \"just walked out the door,\" so perhaps the customer didn't pay, making them at fault. But the original request was to buy groceries, and the customer might have been trying to correct the error but gave up.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the customer is in the wrong) because they left the situation unresolved and potentially didn't pay for the product. However, the employee's uncooperative behavior might have contributed. But the customer's responsibility is to resolve the issue, even if it's frustrating. Therefore, the customer could be in the wrong for not following up properly."
