She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at a deli. The person went to buy some turkey meat. They asked for 1 lb at $3.98 per pound. The employee gave them 1.745 lbs but charged $6.98 per pound, making the total around $12.18. The customer noticed the mistake, pointed it out, and there was some back and forth. The employee tried to correct it by taking out some meat, but the customer got frustrated and left without saying anything.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the customer acted appropriately. The customer initially asked for a specific weight and price. When they noticed the error, they politely mentioned it. The employee initially denied there was a mistake, then tried to adjust the weight by removing slices, but it seems like the customer became upset. The key points here are the customer's actions and whether they overstepped.\n\nThe employee made an error in pricing and weight. The customer correctly pointed out the discrepancy. The employee's response was to question the customer, which might have escalated the situation. The customer, feeling frustrated, left without completing the transaction. The question is whether the customer is in the wrong for not handling it more calmly, like asking to speak to a manager, or if their reaction was justified given the employee's inaction or incorrect actions.\n\nIn such scenarios, customers are expected to handle disputes respectfully, even if they're frustrated. The customer did try to address the issue but became overwhelmed. However, walking out without resolving the matter could be seen as impolite. On the other hand, the employee's actions might have contributed to the customer's frustration. The employee initially denied the mistake and then tried to correct it in a way that might not have been satisfactory. \n\nThe customer's primary goal was to buy groceries, and the situation became a hassle. The employee's mistake led to the problem, but the customer's reaction (leaving without a word) might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the customer's initial request was straightforward, and the employee's error caused the issue. The customer's frustration is understandable, but the way they exited might be the issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong for being frustrated, but their action of walking out without communication might be seen as the asshole move. Alternatively, the employee's handling of the situation could be at fault. But the question is whether the customer is in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the customer's reaction was proportionate. Since they did try to address the issue and then left, maybe they're not in the wrong. The employee's error and response might have been the real problem. However, in social norms, leaving without a word might be seen as rude. \n\nHmm. So the possible answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the employee made a mistake, and the customer tried to address it but left due to frustration. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) because they didn't follow up properly. I think the key is that the customer did attempt to resolve the issue but couldn't handle the employee's response. The author's frustration is justified, but leaving without communication is the asshole move. However, given the employee's error and the way she handled it, the customer's reaction might be understandable. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
