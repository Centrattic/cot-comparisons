She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused without saying a word. The situation involves a pricing mistake at the deli.\n\nFirst, the shopper asked for oven roasted turkey at $3.98 per pound. The deli employee gave them 1.745 pounds priced at $6.98 per pound. The shopper pointed out the discrepancy, and the employee claimed the price had increased but the sign hadn't been updated. Then, when the shopper noted the weight was over a pound, the employee tried to adjust the weight by taking out slices. The shopper got frustrated and left without further confrontation.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the shopper was wrong to leave in that situation. The employee made a mistake with both the price and the weight. The shopper tried to correct the price first, which was valid. When the employee didn't address the weight issue properly (just taking out a couple of slices without explaining), the shopper got fed up. \n\nThe shopper didn't yell or act aggressively; they just left. They might feel that the employee was being dismissive or unhelpful, so their frustration is understandable. However, the shopper could have spoken to a manager if they were concerned about being overcharged. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for not doing so and leaving.\n\nThe key points are: the employee made errors, the shopper tried to correct them, but the employee's response was inadequate. The shopper's reaction was to leave, which might be seen as a valid response to poor customer service. They didn't cause a scene or attack the employee, just left. So, it's possible the shopper isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B (No), because the shopper had a right to be frustrated and didn't escalate the situation beyond pointing out the mistake.\n"
