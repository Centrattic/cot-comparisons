She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. The situation involves a pricing error and a conflict over the weight and price of the turkey meat.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the customer's actions. The customer went to the deli, asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee initially sliced it but then charged $6.98/lb for 1.745 lbs, totaling $12.18. The customer pointed out the mistake, the employee claimed the price had increased but hadn't updated the sign. The customer then noticed the weight was over a pound, got into an argument, and the employee tried to repackage it by taking slices and tearing them. The customer then left without saying anything, leaving the employee confused.\n\nSo, the key points are: the employee made a pricing error, possibly overcharged, and then tried to fix it by reducing the amount, which the customer found unacceptable. The customer's frustration is understandable, especially when the employee's actions seemed inconsiderate. The customer didn't confront the manager but left abruptly. \n\nThe question is whether the customer is at fault. The customer pointed out the mistake politely first, then the employee's response was confusing. When the employee tried to repackage, the customer lost patience. However, the customer did try to address the issue initially. The employee's behavior (tearing slices, not explaining clearly) might have contributed to the customer's frustration. The customer's decision to leave without further confrontation might be seen as a last resort rather than a first reaction. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the employer made an error, but the customer's response was to walk out, which could be seen as impolite or abrupt. However, given the employee's confusing actions and the customer's attempts to resolve it, it might not be entirely the customer's fault. The employee should have handled the mistake more professionally, but the customer's reaction could be seen as justified due to the stress and confusion caused. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the customer isn't in the wrong. The employee's handling of the mistake was poor, leading to the customer's frustration and decision to leave. The customer did try to resolve it but was met with unprofessional behavior. The customer's actions, while abrupt, were a response to the employee's mistakes and poor communication."
