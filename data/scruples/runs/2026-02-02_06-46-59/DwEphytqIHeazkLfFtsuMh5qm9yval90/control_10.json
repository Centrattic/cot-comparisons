She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is at a deli where there was a pricing error. The author went there for meat, got overcharged, and ended up leaving the deli girl confused with the meat.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The customer asked for 1lb of turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli girl made it almost 1.75lbs and charged $6.98 per pound. The customer noticed the price discrepancy and pointed it out. The employee said the price had gone up but hadn't updated the sign. Then, when the customer mentioned the weight being over a pound, she took back the meat and tried to adjust it by cutting slices, but the customer got frustrated and left without saying anything.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author acted inappropriately. The deli employee made a mistake in pricing and then in the amount given. The customer tried to point out the pricing error first, which is valid because the price on the sign didn't match what they were charged. Then, when the employee said the price increased, the customer asked about the weight. The employee then started re-weighing and cutting the meat, which might have been confusing or frustrating for the customer. The customer, feeling that the interaction was going nowhere and the employee wasn't resolving the issue, left in frustration.\n\nNow, considering the possible wrongdoings. The customer didn't yell or be rude, but they left without resolving the issue and didn't speak to a manager. The employee was making mistakes, possibly due to the price change not being updated. The customer's frustration is understandable because they were being overcharged both in weight and price. However, walking out might be seen as not trying to resolve the issue. But given the situation, maybe the customer was right to leave if they felt the employee wasn't addressing the problem correctly.\n\nThe question is whether the customer is the asshole. The answer depends on whether they had a responsibility to stay and escalate the issue. If they left without confrontation, maybe they were justified because the employee wasn't helping. However, not speaking to a manager could leave the store without knowing about the error. But the customer's main goal was to get the correct item, and when the employee wasn't helping, leaving might be acceptable. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the customer isn't in the wrong. The deli made errors, the employee wasn't handling it correctly, and the customer left out of frustration, which is understandable. The customer wasn't being rude but just walked out, which isn't necessarily wrong. The main issue lies with the store's errors and the employee's handling of the situation.\n"
