She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving the deli girl confused. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nThe author went to the deli and asked for 1lb of oven roasted turkey at $3.98/lb. The employee sliced it, asked if it's okay if it's a bit over, which the author agreed to. But the price came out to $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The author pointed out the price mistake, and the employee said the price increased but the sign wasn't updated. Then the author noticed the weight was almost two pounds, which they didn't ask for. The employee took the meat back, started rebagging it by removing slices and cutting them to get the correct weight. The author then left without saying a word.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the employee made a pricing error and possibly a weighing error. The author tried to correct the pricing first, which the employee admitted was a mistake. Then the weight was more than requested. The employee tried to fix the weight by removing meat, but the author got frustrated and left.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the employee was making mistakes. The author pointed out the pricing error, which was valid. Then the weight was more than requested, which is another issue. The employee tried to adjust but maybe didn't communicate clearly. The author's reaction was to leave without saying anything, not confronting the manager. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. But maybe the employee was incorrect in both price and weight. The author was polite initially, but became frustrated. However, leaving without a word might have been rude, especially if the employee was already struggling. On the other hand, the employee made mistakes, so the author isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. The employee was at fault for the pricing and weight issues. The author tried to correct them, but when the employee didn't handle it properly, frustration led to leaving. Maybe the author could have asked to speak to a manager, but they chose not to. However, the employee was confused and making a mess, so maybe the author wasn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the employee made errors, and the author tried to correct them but couldn't handle the situation further. The author's frustration is understandable, and walking out might be a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n"
