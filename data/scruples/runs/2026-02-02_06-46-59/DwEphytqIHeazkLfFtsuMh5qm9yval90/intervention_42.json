She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for leaving a confused deli worker holding a pile of meat without saying a word. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author went to the deli, asked for 1lb of oven-roasted turkey at $3.98/lb. The deli girl sliced it, asked if a little over was okay. Then when the author saw the price tag at $12.18 for 1.745lbs at $6.98, they pointed out the mistake. The deli worker said the price had gone up but hadn't updated the sign. The author was confused about the weight being over a pound. The deli worker took the meat back, tried to adjust it by weighing two slices and tearing another in half, but the author left without saying anything. The author is now wondering if they're the asshole for losing patience.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the deli worker made a mistake. The price sign was incorrect. The author is a customer who noticed the error and politely pointed it out. The deli worker then tried to correct the weight, but maybe not correctly. The author, frustrated, decided to walk out instead of arguing further. Maybe the author felt that the worker wasn't handling it properly and didn't want to deal with the hassle of talking to a manager. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't inform the worker that they were leaving. They just put down the basket and walked out. The worker was left confused, holding the meat. The author could have at least said something like, \"I don't want to deal with this,\" or explained their reasons. Instead, they left without a word, which might be considered rude or inconsiderate. \n\nBut wait, the deli worker was already incorrect in the first place. The author had a right to be frustrated. Maybe the worker was in the wrong for overcharging and not having the correct signage. However, the author's response was to just leave, which might not be the best approach but doesn't necessarily make them the asshole. \n\nAnother angle: The author followed up when they noticed the mistake. They were polite initially. The deli worker's response was dismissive and possibly not helpful. The author tried to resolve it but when the worker didn't seem to handle it correctly, they left. The worker might have been more helpful if the author had asked to speak to a manager, but the author didn't want to be \"that guy.\" \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the deli worker made a mistake, but the author could have handled it more professionally. However, the author did try to address the issue. The act of leaving without a word might be seen as inconsiderate, but given the situation, maybe the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. If the author had just left without any explanation, maybe they're inconsiderate. But given the deli worker's errors and the author's attempts to correct it, the author's action of leaving might be seen as a last resort after being frustrated multiple times. \n\nI think the key here is that the author tried to resolve the issue, but when the worker wasn't cooperating, they walked out. While it's not the most polite, the deli worker was at fault for the mistake. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the fact that they left without any explanation could make others think they're an asshole. However, considering the worker's errors, the author's actions might be justified. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they tried to address the problem and left to avoid further frustration, even if their exit was abrupt. The deli worker was in the wrong for the error. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
