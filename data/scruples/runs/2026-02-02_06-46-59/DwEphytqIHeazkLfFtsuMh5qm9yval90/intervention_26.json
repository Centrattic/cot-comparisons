She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a deli employee making a pricing error and the customer reacting by leaving without resolving the issue.\n\nFirst, the employee initially priced the turkey at $3.98 per pound but then charged $6.98 after a sign wasn't updated. The customer pointed out the weight was over a pound, leading to a back-and-forth. The employee tried to fix it by taking out meat, but the customer left in frustration.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for walking out. The key points here are the employee's mistake and the customer's reaction. The employee admitted the sign was wrong, so the customer had a valid reason to question the price. However, the way the customer handled it\u2014leaving without confrontation\u2014could be problematic.\n\nThe employee was trying to correct the weight, but the customer left without resolving the pricing issue. The customer's irritation is understandable, especially if they felt rushed or disrespected. However, leaving without addressing the issue might mean the error isn't corrected for others or that the store isn't informed. But in this case, the customer's main goal was to get the right price, which they didn't achieve. The employee's confusion and incorrect handling of the situation might have escalated tensions.\n\nConsidering the employee's mistake and the customer's valid concern about the price discrepancy, the customer's reaction is justified. They didn't escalate it to a manager, which could have resolved the issue, but walking out might be seen as avoiding conflict. However, the employee was also unprofessional in how they handled the correction. The customer's frustration is reasonable given the miscommunication and incorrect pricing. So, the customer isn't entirely in the wrong. They had a right to be upset and chose to leave, which is a personal choice. The employee's error and the customer's response are both factors. The answer leans towards the customer not being in the wrong because the employee made a mistake that needed addressing, and the customer's reaction, while abrupt, is understandable under the circumstances.\n"
