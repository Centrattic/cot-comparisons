She starts slicing the meat and asks me if it's ok if it's a little over. \n\nOf course it is.\n\nShe bags up the meat, prices it, and hands it to me. I look at it like wtf.\n\nThe slices are half as thick as a DVD case, and the price tag says $12.18 for 1.745 lbs @ $6.98/lb.\n\nI politely tell her I think she made a mistake, my shit's $3.98/lb. \n\nShe says \"No, sorry, the price has gone up, we just haven't changed the sign.\"\n\nI said, politely: \"I asked for a pound, this says it's almost two.\"\n\nShe takes it from me and says \"where does it say that?\" \n\nAt this point, I'm audibly irritated.\n\n\"At the top. Right there. One point seven four five pounds.\"\n\n\"Well I asked you if it was ok if it was a little over...\"\n\nShe starts taking out the meat, which is so thick, this shit's like 5-6 fucking slices, and begins to rebag and weigh it. \n\nShe puts 2 slices on the scale. \n\nGrabs another slice and tears it in half, tosses that on too.\n\nBags it, prices it. Tries to hand it to me.\n\nI looked right through her dead eyes, put my stupid little shopping basket down on the ground where I was standing, and just walked out the door.\n\nAm I the asshole for not being able to deal with this person? I instantly lost all patience, and I didn't wanna be that guy who's like \"Can I speak to your manager?\" \n\nI just wanted to buy some fucking groceries.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was wrong here. So, the situation is about a deli counter where the customer got charged more than expected. The author asked for 1 lb of turkey meat at $3.98/lb, but the receipt came out to $12.18 for 1.745 lbs at $6.98/lb. The employee initially made a mistake with the price and then tried to adjust the weight.\n\nFirst, the employee's mistake: the price sign was outdated. They charged the higher price without updating the sign. The customer pointed this out politely. Then, when the customer mentioned the weight was over a pound, the employee responded by cutting the meat into smaller pieces to make it under a pound. The customer got frustrated and left without saying a word to the employee, who was left holding the meat.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the customer's reaction and the employee's actions. The employee made two errors: incorrect pricing and incorrect weight. The customer tried to point these out and the employee then tried to fix it by cutting the meat, but the customer didn't accept that and left.\n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable because they were overcharged and the employee's method of correcting the weight was messy and perhaps unprofessional. However, the customer could have asked to speak to a manager or at least left the situation more politely. Instead, they just walked out, leaving the employee with the problem. That's where the issue lies. The customer didn't take responsibility for the employee being left in an awkward position, even if the employee was at fault initially. \n\nBut wait, the employee was the one who made the mistake. The customer was there to get what they paid for. If the employee couldn't correct the error properly, maybe the customer wasn't obligated to stay and deal with it. However, leaving the employee with the meat without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. The employee might not know how to resolve it themselves if the manager isn't around. The customer could have at least said they were going to leave the issue for another day or something, instead of just disappearing. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, even if the other person is wrong, it's better to handle it politely. The customer's main mistake was not dealing with the situation in a constructive way, leading the employee to be confused and holding the meat. So, while the employee had errors, the customer's abrupt departure without resolution might be seen as the asshole move.\n"
