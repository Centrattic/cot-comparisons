He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's father passed away and left him the car dealership to run. He works in NYC and can't manage it daily, so they hired a manager, Amy. The main issue is with a trans sales rep named Anna. The author isn't against trans people but is concerned that customers are leaving because they don't want to interact with a trans person. This is causing a drop in profits, and he suggested moving Anna to another role. Amy called him transphobic, and he's asking if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender identity in employment. So if the author is trying to move Anna from her current role because she's trans, that could be discriminatory. But he's not saying they can't work there; he just wants her to move to another job. However, the problem is that the customers are the ones discriminating against her, not the company. The author is making a business decision based on customer behavior. \n\nBut here's the catch: the business can't discriminate against employees based on their gender identity, even if customers are uncomfortable. The ADA and other laws protect employees from such discrimination. So the author is essentially asking to move Anna due to her trans identity, which might be illegal. Even if the reason is customer dissatisfaction, the business can't treat employees differently based on protected characteristics. The author could face legal consequences for that.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical part. The author claims to respect trans people but is making a decision based on their gender identity. This could be seen as transphobic, even if unintentional. The fact that customers are leaving is a societal issue, not the employee's fault. The business should adapt to serve all customers, but that's a different matter. The author's solution is to fire or reassign Anna, which is targeting the employee for the customers' biases.\n\nBut maybe there's a business justification. If the dealership is in a conservative area, maybe they need to adjust their sales approach or marketing to attract more customers. However, the author is focusing on removing the employee rather than addressing customer prejudice. That could be a wrong approach because it's the customers who are the problem, not the employee. They should find ways to educate customers or improve their service, not discriminate against employees.\n\nAlso, the author is in a position of power, and his father's legacy is important. But that doesn't justify discrimination. The business should uphold ethical standards and legal compliance. Maybe the author could look into other solutions, like retraining sales staff to handle customer concerns or improving the sales environment to be more inclusive, thereby retaining employees and customers.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be considered discriminatory and illegal, even if the intention is to save the business. He's targeting an employee based on her gender identity, which is a protected class. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
