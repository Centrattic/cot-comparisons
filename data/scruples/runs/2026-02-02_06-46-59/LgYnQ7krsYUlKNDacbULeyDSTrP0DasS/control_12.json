He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. The situation is that the dealership is in a conservative state, and even though they respect trans people, the business is losing money because some customers leave when they see Anna, the trans sales rep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, including the US, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. The Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in employment, and Title VII of that act has been interpreted to cover gender identity. So, firing someone based on their gender identity could be illegal. However, the author isn't firing her; they're suggesting moving her to another position. But even moving her could be seen as discriminatory if it's based on her gender identity. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) would likely view this as discrimination.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims they have no issue with trans people but are acting in the best interest of the business. However, accommodating transgender employees is a key part of inclusivity. If the business is losing customers due to the customers' prejudices, the issue isn't with Anna but with the customers' transphobia. The business should not be penalized for the biases of a minority of customers. Moreover, creating an inclusive environment is important, and the business might also attract customers who appreciate diversity.\n\nAnother point is that the author is making a business decision based on customer preferences, but it's a form of discrimination. The company has a responsibility to not engage in discriminatory practices, even if it affects profits. The manager, Amy, called the author transphobic, which suggests that the author's action is seen as discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they respect Anna but the customers don't. However, the problem isn't Anna's identity but the customers' reactions. The solution might involve training Anna to handle such situations or providing customer service training for all employees to mitigate the issue without moving her.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author's intentions are to protect the business, the action of moving Anna based on her gender identity is discriminatory and likely illegal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
