He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep. The situation is that the dealership is in a conservative state, and customers are leaving when they see Anna, a trans sales rep. The author argues that it's not Anna's fault but that the business is losing money. They suggested moving her to another role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In the US, there are laws protecting against discrimination based on gender identity, especially in employment. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act covers discrimination based on sex, which the Supreme Court has interpreted to include discrimination based on gender identity. So, if the dealership is firing or demoting Anna because she's trans, that could be illegal. However, the author isn't firing her; they're suggesting moving her to a different role. But maybe the intention is still discriminatory if it's based solely on her gender identity.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The author claims they have no issue with trans people and respect them. However, their action is based on the assumption that customers are prejudiced against trans people, which is harmful and discriminatory. The author is prioritizing business profits over the rights of an employee, which might be seen as unethical even if their intent isn't malicious.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that customers are leaving because of Anna's gender identity. But that's a reflection of the customers' biases, not Anna's fault. Businesses can't discriminate to appease discriminatory customers. It's a slippery slope where if you give in to such demands, you're perpetuating discrimination.\n\nThen, there's the part where Amy called the author transphobic. The author's suggestion, even if framed as wanting to protect the business, could be seen as discriminatory. The author is making a business decision based on the gender identity of an employee, which is a protected class. Therefore, it's not just about the customers' behavior but the business's response to it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to save the dealership from financial loss. However, there might be other solutions, like providing training for employees to address customer concerns differently or improving customer service elsewhere. The author's solution is to move Anna, which directly affects her job role based on her identity.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's action is likely discriminatory under the law and ethically problematic. Even if they have good intentions, the outcome could be harmful to Anna and perpetuate transphobia. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
