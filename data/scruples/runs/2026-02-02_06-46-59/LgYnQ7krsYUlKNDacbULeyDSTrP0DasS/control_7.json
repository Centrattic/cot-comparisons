He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity. So firing someone because they are trans is illegal. The author is suggesting moving Anna to another job, which might not be firing, but could still be a form of discrimination if it's based on her gender identity and not her job performance.\n\nThen, there's the business argument. The author claims that customers are leaving because Anna is trans, leading to lost profits. But is that a valid business reason? It's possible that the customers are biased, but the business doesn't get to exclude certain customers by discriminating against employees. Plus, the dealership could be held legally liable if they discriminate against Anna.\n\nThe author also mentions respecting trans people, which complicates things. They might genuinely believe they're acting in the business's best interest, but their actions still contribute to a discriminatory environment. The manager Amy called them transphobic, which could be accurate if their decision is based solely on Anna's gender identity without any other justification.\n\nAnother angle: The dealership is in a conservative area, which might mean more transphobic customers. However, the business can't cater to discriminatory customers by discriminating against employees. There's also the potential for backlash if the situation becomes public, which could harm the business more in the long run.\n\nThe author's motivation is to honor their father's wishes and keep the business profitable. But profit shouldn't justify illegal or unethical practices. The right decision here, legally and ethically, would be to find other ways to address customer biases without harming Anna's position. Maybe training for staff, or different approaches to customer service, rather than moving her.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because their decision is based on discriminatory reasons against a protected class, which is illegal, and it's unethical to prioritize biased customers over an employee's rights.\n"
