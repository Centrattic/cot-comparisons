He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a transgender sales rep at their father's dealership. The situation involves the author's concern that customers are leaving when they see Anna, a trans woman, which is affecting profits. The author argues it's a business decision, not discrimination, but Amy (the manager) called them transphobic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, it's illegal to discriminate against employees based on gender identity. The U.S. EEOC considers discrimination based on gender identity part of sex discrimination under Title VII. So, even if the author's intention is business, firing or moving Anna because of her gender identity could be legally problematic.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author claims they respect trans people but are making a decision based on customer reactions. However, allowing business decisions to be influenced by customers' prejudice could perpetuate discrimination. The author might be justifying a discriminatory action under the guise of business necessity.\n\nThe author's argument hinges on the business losing money, but they should consider if there are other solutions. For example, providing training to staff to handle customer interactions, or addressing customer concerns without removing Anna. The EEOC has guidelines about balancing religious and sexual orientation discrimination, which might apply here if the author is using customer preferences as a defense.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their father's wishes and the importance of the dealership's success. However, maintaining a business ethically and legally is equally important. The author's approach could set a precedent of discrimination, which might harm the dealership's reputation in the long run, especially if more people become aware and support inclusive practices.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention is to prevent financial loss, the action of moving Anna due to her gender identity likely constitutes discrimination. The correct approach would be to address customer biases through other means rather than accommodating the bias by removing the employee.\n"
