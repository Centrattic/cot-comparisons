He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep at their family's car dealership. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's father passed away and left the dealership to them. They hired a manager, Amy, and a sales rep named Anna, who is transgender. The author notices that when Anna is present, some customers leave, and this is affecting profits. The author suggests moving Anna to another role, but Amy calls them transphobic. The author argues that it's not Anna's fault, but they're losing business.\n\nSo, the key points here are discrimination based on gender identity and the business impact. The author claims they have no issue with trans people but are concerned about customer reactions. However, the question is whether this is a valid reason to move Anna from her role.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited, especially in employment. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) might not apply here, but Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, protects against discrimination based on gender identity. So, if Anna is a qualified employee, the dealership can't discriminate against her based on customers' biases.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is prioritizing business losses due to customers' prejudice over the rights and dignity of an employee. This could be seen as reinforcing discriminatory practices. The author might argue it's a business decision, but it's still discriminatory, as they're making a choice based on customers' transphobia rather than Anna's performance.\n\nThe author also mentions that Anna is a good sales rep, which complicates things. If she's effective, moving her could be based on irrelevant factors. The author's respect for trans people is stated, but actions (discriminating due to customer aversion) contradict that. The author is holding Anna accountable for others' prejudices, which isn't fair.\n\nAdditionally, the dealership's location in a conservative state might mean the customer base isn't diverse, but that doesn't justify discrimination. The business should adapt, perhaps by targeting a different demographic or educating staff on inclusivity rather than catering to bigoted customers.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to potentially move Anna because of her gender identity, despite her qualifications, is discriminatory. The business impact is a result of customers' transphobia, not Anna's job performance. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
