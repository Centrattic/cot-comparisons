He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because customers are leaving. The situation is that the dealership is in a conservative area, and Anna, the trans sales rep, is causing some customers to leave. The author argues that it's a business decision to keep the dealership afloat, not a personal issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In the US, employment discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as interpreted by the courts. So firing or moving Anna because she's trans could be illegal. The EEOC and courts have ruled that discrimination against transgender individuals is a form of sex discrimination. That means the dealership can't legally discriminate against her in terms of her role if she's performing well.\n\nNext, the business argument. The author claims profits have dropped because customers are leaving due to Anna's presence. However, this seems like a form of customer discrimination that the business is trying to accommodate. But legally, businesses can't discriminate against employees based on who their customers are, unless there's a legitimate business reason. However, in this case, the problem is the customers' prejudice, not Anna's performance. The employer can't just adjust roles based on customers' biases if it's not related to job performance.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author says they have no issue with trans people personally, but the business is suffering. However, accommodating customers who discriminate against Anna would be against anti-discrimination laws. The author's action of suggesting moving Anna could be seen as enabling discriminatory behavior by the customers, which is not acceptable. The business should find other ways to retain customers without compromising their employees' rights.\n\nAmy called the author transphobic, which might be a strong term, but the core issue is the author's decision to potentially move Anna to avoid losing customers. The key here is that the author is making a business decision that leads to discrimination against an employee in a protected class. Even if the author isn't personally transphobic, the action itself is discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that it's about business survival might not hold up. The law prioritizes protecting employees from discrimination over catering to discriminatory customers. There are plenty of businesses that manage to serve diverse customers without compromising their values, perhaps through training or other strategies. The author could explore other solutions instead of moving Anna, like training staff to handle customer interactions better or addressing the root causes of customer dissatisfaction beyond Anna's gender identity.\n\nIn summary, even though the author's intention might be to save the business, the action of moving Anna due to her being trans is a form of discrimination that's legally and ethically wrong. The author is in the wrong because they're contributing to a hostile work environment for Anna and enabling customer discrimination, which is prohibited.\n"
