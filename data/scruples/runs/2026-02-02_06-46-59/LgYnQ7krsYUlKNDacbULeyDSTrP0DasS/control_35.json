He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because some customers are leaving, causing a drop in profits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. The U.S., for example, has protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. So if the author is firing or moving Anna because she's trans, that could be illegal. They might be infringing on her rights.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author claims they have nothing against trans people but are making a business decision based on customer reactions. But that's a form of discrimination. They're prioritizing the comfort of customers over the rights of an employee. Even if the customers are uncomfortable, the company can't discriminate against employees to accommodate bigoted customers.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that this is about business loss could be seen as a pretext for discrimination. They're using business reasons to justify a decision that's rooted in the customers' prejudice. Legally, that might not hold up. Courts often look at whether the discrimination is justified by business necessity, which it doesn't seem to be here.\n\nAnother angle: the author's sister is mentioned but not involved. The author is in charge, so they have the responsibility to uphold fair practices. Their father's wishes might include ethical business practices, not just profit. Plus, the author could explore other solutions like training staff to handle customer complaints or educating customers, instead of moving Anna.\n\nThe manager, Amy, called the author transphobic, which aligns with the legal and ethical viewpoint that the author is discriminating. The author might not realize that their actions, despite good intentions, are discriminatory.\n\nIn summary, even if the author has good intentions, the action of moving Anna based on her trans identity is likely discriminatory and legally problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
