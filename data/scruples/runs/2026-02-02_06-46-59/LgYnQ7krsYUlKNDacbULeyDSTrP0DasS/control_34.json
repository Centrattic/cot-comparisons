He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for not wanting a trans woman, Anna, to be a sales rep because it's causing customers to leave, leading to profit loss.\n\nFirst, the author respects trans people and has no personal issues with Anna. The problem is that the dealership is in a conservative area, and some customers are uncomfortable with Anna's visible trans identity. The author's concern is business-related\u2014retaining customers and profits. However, moving Anna to another position might be seen as discrimination. \n\nLegally, in many places, including the U.S., employment discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. The EEOC considers discrimination against transgender individuals as sex discrimination under Title VII. So, even if the author's intentions are to protect business, firing or reassigning Anna based on her gender identity could be illegal. \n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing business over employee rights. While the author claims it's about maintaining profits, the decision could be seen as discriminatory. The author might argue that it's for the business's survival, but that doesn't override the legal and ethical obligation to not discriminate. \n\nAmy, the manager, called the author transphobic, which the author denies. The author's reasoning is that it's not Anna's fault, but the situation highlights a conflict between business interests and anti-discrimination principles. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own lack of direct management experience. They hired a manager and later intervene, which might complicate their authority. But the main issue is the justification for the action.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to suggest moving Anna due to her gender identity, despite her competence, likely constitutes discrimination. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
