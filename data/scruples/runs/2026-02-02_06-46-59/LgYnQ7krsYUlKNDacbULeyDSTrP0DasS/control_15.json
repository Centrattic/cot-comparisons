He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about a trans sales rep causing customers to leave a car dealership in a conservative area. The author is considering moving her to another position to avoid losing business.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical implications. In many places, especially in the U.S., employment discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been interpreted to cover transgender individuals. So, firing or demoting someone because they are transgender could be considered illegal discrimination. \n\nThe author is not openly discriminating against Anna because she's trans; they're making a business decision based on customer behavior. But the key point is whether that decision is legal. If the state where the dealership is located has anti-discrimination laws protecting transgender people, then the author might be violating those laws. Even if the author's intention is to save business, the action could be illegal.\n\nEthically, it's a tricky situation. The author claims to respect trans people but is acting in a way that could be seen as discriminatory. The argument is that the business is losing money, but it's also important to consider the rights of employees and the potential damage to the dealership's reputation by accommodating discriminatory behavior. \n\nAnother angle: The author is the one who hired Amy, and Amy hired Anna. So the responsibility for the hiring decision was delegated. The author might feel they have the right to make changes if the business is suffering, but that's where the legal issues come in. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the customers are leaving because Anna is trans, but it's their own prejudice that's causing the loss, not Anna's performance. The author is essentially penalizing Anna for others' biases. \n\nIn terms of business ethics, there's a balance between profitability and social responsibility. The dealership might need to address the customer issue rather than moving Anna. Maybe training staff to handle customer concerns, or marketing to a more inclusive audience. \n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author might be in the wrong if their state's laws protect trans employees. Ethically, it's questionable because they're discriminating based on others' prejudices. Even if the author's intention is to save the business, the action could be illegal and unethical. Therefore, the answer is likely A (in the wrong).\n"
