He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans girl as a sales rep because some customers are uncomfortable. \n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that they have no issue with trans people but are concerned about losing business in a conservative area. They claim that customers are leaving when they see Anna, a trans sales rep, leading to a drop in profits. They suggested moving her to another role.\n\nBut legally, in the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on gender identity. So even if the business is in a conservative state, firing or reassigning a trans employee because of their gender identity could be illegal. The author might be conflating customer preferences with legal obligations. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's a business decision to protect profits. However, businesses can't discriminate against employees based on protected characteristics, even if they face backlash from customers. There might be other solutions, like retraining staff to handle customer concerns without punishing Anna. \n\nAlso, the author's approach could be seen as discriminatory because they're making a decision based on Anna's gender identity, not her performance. The author argues it's about the business, but the core issue is whether they're treating an employee unfairly. \n\nSo, even if the author has good intentions, the action itself (suggesting to move her due to her gender identity) is discriminatory and likely against the law. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
