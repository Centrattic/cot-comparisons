He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a car dealership in a conservative state where a trans sales rep, Anna, is causing customers to leave because of her identity. The author, who's taking over the dealership, wants to move her to another role to prevent losing business. Amy, the manager, called him transphobic.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal side. In many places, including the US, employment discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) considers discrimination against transgender individuals as sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. So, if the author is asking to move Anna based solely on her being trans, that could be illegal. Even if the business is losing customers, the law protects employees from being discriminated against in their roles.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The author claims to have no issue with trans people but is making a decision that discriminates against Anna. The problem here is not just about the author's feelings but about treating Anna unfairly. Customers leaving because of their bias isn't the employee's fault. The dealership should address the customers' prejudices rather than accommodating them by moving Anna. The author is prioritizing profit over non-discrimination, which might be ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that moving Anna would prevent the business from failing is a business decision that's not justified by law. If the business is suffering because of customer bias, that's a societal issue, not the employee's. The author could look into other strategies to handle the situation, like training staff to handle customer interactions better or marketing to attract a more inclusive customer base.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that Amy hired Anna, and the author is now suggesting a change. This could be seen as undermining Amy's decision and possibly creating a hostile work environment for Anna. If the author is in a position of authority, making such a move without proper justification could lead to legal trouble and damage the workplace culture.\n\nBut wait, the author says they have nothing against trans people. So maybe they think it's a business necessity. However, in legal terms, business necessity as a defense must show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity, which isn't the case here. The problem isn't Anna's job performance but the biases of the customers. Therefore, the author's justification doesn't hold up under legal scrutiny.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because their decision is based on discriminatory practices against a protected class, which is illegal and unethical. They should address the customer's prejudices instead of moving Anna.\n"
