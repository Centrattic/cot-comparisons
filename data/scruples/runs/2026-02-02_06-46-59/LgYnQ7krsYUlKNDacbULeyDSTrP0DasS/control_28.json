He owned and ran an independent car dealership. At this point. He expressed wishes for me to run it when he was gone since I work in 'business' as opposed to my sister (admittedly, I'm a trader at a prop shop, which isn't really running a business, but whatever). However, I work in NYC, so I can't do it day to day. And quite honestly, running a car dealership sounds boring. But, it was my dad's wishes, so I wanted to work something out. So we hired an outside manager to kind of take care of day-to-day operations, and then I could fly in on the weekends to take care of the big picture. \n\nAnyways, the manager we hired, let's call her Amy, is about my age, and seems to be doing a pretty good job in day-to-day operations. One thing I noticed when I was there is that there's a trans girl who works as a sales rep, let's call her Anna. I just want to make it clear I have nothing against trans people at all. I respect them, just like I would anybody else. But the problem is question here is that other people who visit the dealership don't respect her. See, it's in a pretty conservative state. And Anna's pretty obviously trans. Amy hired her, for good reason: Anna's confident, charming, convincing. Everything we need in a sales rep. But, and this is a big but, she's trans. And a lot of customers who come to the dealership leave when they see this. It's wrong they do this, of course, but from a business standpoint, the dealership is losing customers. And I've checked overall profits, they've dropped because of this. And this is my dad's dealership, I don't want to ruin it. \n\nSo I brought up to Amy she might want to co sider moving Anna to another job in the dealership, and explained my rationale. Amy called me transphobic. I explained I know it's not Anna's fault, but she's costing us money, and I don't want my dad's dealership to fail in any way. \n\nAm I in the wrong here?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting a trans sales rep. The author's argument is that customers are leaving because Anna is trans, and they want to keep the dealership from failing. They mention they respect trans people and it's about business not personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, so businesses can't deny service based on sex, which includes gender identity. If the dealership is losing customers because they discriminate against trans individuals, the business might actually be in violation of the law. However, the author is suggesting moving Anna to a different role, not firing her. But even that could be seen as discriminatory if it's based on her gender identity.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. While the author claims no personal bias, they are making a business decision that could be discriminatory. The argument is that it's a business loss, but that's using a prejudice against a protected group as a reason for employment action. Employers are generally expected to address customer bias without compromising the rights of employees. Maybe the author should instead work on training staff to handle customer interactions better, or educate customers, rather than moving Anna.\n\nAlso, the author is taking over the business after their dad's passing, which might involve balancing his wishes with their own. But Amy, the manager, called them transphobic, which suggests she might think the decision is based on discrimination. The author could be misjudging the situation, assuming that moving Anna is the only solution. There might be other ways to retain customers without compromising Anna's role.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention is business-related, the decision to move Anna due to customers' transphobia is likely discriminatory. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
