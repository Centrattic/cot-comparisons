      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed during a cruise in a public way, the girlfriend said yes, but then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes during the proposal but later didn't want to marry him. The author is upset because he feels she led him on, while she argues that he moved too fast and didn't talk about the engagement first.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion. Let me think about the dynamics here.\n\nOn one hand, planning a public proposal without discussing it with the partner is a big move. It's possible that the girlfriend didn't realize he was going to propose, so she said yes in the moment but wasn't ready for a commitment. That could be her part in the situation, but maybe the author didn't approach the topic properly.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes. That's a significant shift. However, the author is upset because she didn't communicate her feelings before the proposal. But she did say she wasn't ready and that they were moving too fast. So maybe she didn't want to commit, but the way she handled it was hurtful.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. Insensitivity could be on both sides. He might have been insensitive by not discussing the proposal first, which could have led to her agreeing on the spot without being prepared. But she was also insensitive by changing her mind after the initial yes, causing emotional pain.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The author didn't talk about the proposal, leading to an impulsive agreement. The girlfriend then changed her mind, which is understandable if she wasn't ready, but the way she handled it might not have been the best. However, the author's decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity might be his way of dealing with the hurt, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. Let me consider that viewpoint. If the author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, he might have forced a situation where she felt pressured to say yes. So, he could be at fault for not having that conversation. However, the girlfriend's change of heart after saying yes is also an issue. It's a mutual problem.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. If the author didn't check in with her about wanting to get engaged, then he might have assumed she was ready. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she wasn't ready for that step, so the author moving ahead without communication could be his fault. On the other hand, she still initially said yes, then changed her mind later, which complicates things.\n\nIn many cases, public proposals can be seen as a surprise, but it's important to have that conversation first. The girlfriend might not have been ready, and the author's action might have pushed her into a situation where she felt she had to say yes in the moment. Therefore, the author's part in not discussing the engagement beforehand could be his fault. The girlfriend's change of heart is also an issue, but the initial problem might lie with the author's approach.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't discuss the proposal with his girlfriend first, leading to her agreeing in the moment but not being ready. His lack of communication was a misstep, which contributed to the situation where she changed her mind after the proposal.\n"
