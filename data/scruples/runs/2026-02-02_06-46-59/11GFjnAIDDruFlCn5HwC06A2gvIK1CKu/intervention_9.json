I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author proposed during a cruise with a public setup, and the girlfriend said yes, leading to celebrations. Later, she changed her mind, and the author ended the relationship. The author feels she's in the wrong because she changed her mind after saying yes, while she claims it's his fault for not discussing the engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author planned a public proposal without prior discussion. Public proposals can be seen as a big step, especially if the couple hasn't talked about their future plans together. The girlfriend might feel pressured or that the proposal happened too quickly. On the other hand, she said yes and then retracted it, which can be hurtful and confusing. The author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook that, which might be a valid reaction to broken trust.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but I need to analyze it. The key points are:\n\n1. The author didn't discuss the proposal with his girlfriend beforehand. Public proposals can be exciting but might not be the best approach if the couple hasn't had a serious conversation about their future.\n2. The girlfriend changed her mind after accepting, which is understandable if she wasn't ready, but it's still hurtful.\n3. The author ended the relationship, which could be seen as a reaction to betrayal.\n\nIn terms of fault, both parties have some responsibility. The author didn't communicate his intentions, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her feelings before accepting. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. If the author is in the wrong, it would be because he didn't seek her input before proposing, leading to her feeling unprepared. However, if the author isn't in the wrong, it's because he acted on his feelings and the girlfriend's retraction was her responsibility.\n\nI think there's a balance here. The author's approach might have contributed to the situation, but the girlfriend's actions also played a role. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The main issue is the public proposal without discussion. If the author had talked to her first, maybe they could have resolved it. But since he didn't, perhaps he's partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's retraction is also hurtful. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because his proposal was based on his own feelings and the girlfriend's initial acceptance. However, the way he proposed might have been a mistake, but the main fault could be shared. But the question is about the author's wrongness specifically. So if the author is in the wrong, it's for not discussing first. If not, then maybe she's in the wrong. But the user's own view is that the author is wrong. Hmm. This is tricky. I need to decide between A and B.\n"
