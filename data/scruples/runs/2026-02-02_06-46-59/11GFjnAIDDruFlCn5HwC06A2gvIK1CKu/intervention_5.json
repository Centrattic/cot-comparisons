      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed on a cruise in a public way, she said yes but later changed her mind. He felt hurt and broke up, and now he's asking if he's the at-fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer did plan a big, public proposal without discussing it with her first. That could be a problem because a proposal is a significant step, and not talking about it beforehand might have been a misstep. The girlfriend says they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready. That makes sense\u2014some people need time and want to discuss major life decisions before committing.\n\nOn the flip side, when she said yes, the proposer got excited and celebrated, then found out she didn't actually want to marry him. That's a huge emotional letdown. He might feel betrayed, thinking she led him on. But maybe she was just being polite in the moment and realized later she wasn't ready. \n\nThe key points are whether the proposer should have discussed the proposal first, and whether the girlfriend should have been clearer about her feelings. If he didn't talk to her about engagement and marriage before the proposal, that's a mistake. Proposing without that conversation could have been impulsive. However, her changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic because a \"yes\" is a commitment, even if it's later rescinded.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to check if that's the case. If the proposer didn't consider her readiness and pushed for a proposal without discussion, he has some responsibility. The girlfriend might have given mixed signals, but once she said yes, it's hard to blame her for the fallout. However, maybe she should have been honest from the start. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamics, often the person who makes a big move without prior discussion can be seen as the one in the wrong. The proposer's action might have been premature, leading to the situation. The girlfriend's refusal to listen and the resulting breakup might be a reaction to that. So, the proposer could be at fault for not having that conversation first. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong)."
