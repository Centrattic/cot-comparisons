I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and she initially said yes but then changed her mind. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the proposal first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's argument is that she led him on and then changed her mind, which was hurtful. He ended things because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. The girlfriend's side is that the proposal was a surprise and not discussed beforehand, making them move too quickly. She wasn't ready, so she took back her \"yes.\"\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me analyze why. The author set up a public proposal without discussing it with her first. While proposing can be a surprise, a proper engagement usually involves some level of mutual understanding. If the author didn't talk to her about marriage first, he might have assumed she was ready. The girlfriend might have felt pressured into saying yes in that moment, especially in a public setting. She might not have meant it but felt she had to say yes due to the situation. Then, when she realized or felt more comfortable, she changed her mind. That could be seen as honest, even if it hurt him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction of ending the relationship immediately might be seen as extreme. However, he felt his hopes were shattered, and he couldn't move past the insensitivity. But is he in the wrong for that? If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, he might have been partly responsible for the situation. The girlfriend's refusal to listen could also be a problem, but her stance is that the proposal was rushed.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author communicate his intent to propose before the cruise? If not, that's a mistake. Public proposals without discussion can be problematic. The girlfriend's change of heart might be a reflection of her genuine feelings once the initial moment passed, not insensitivity. The author's reaction, while understandable, might stem from his own lack of communication. Therefore, the author could be seen as partly at fault for not discussing the proposal first, leading to the misunderstanding.\n"
