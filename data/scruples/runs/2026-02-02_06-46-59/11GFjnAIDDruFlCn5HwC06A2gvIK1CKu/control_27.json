I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a public proposal that went wrong when the girlfriend took back her \"yes.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal without discussing engagement plans first. The girlfriend said yes initially but then changed her mind. The author felt broken and ended the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity. She, on the other hand, thought he rushed into things without talking about it.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for planning the proposal without discussing it with her first. Engagement is a big step, and communication is crucial. Proposing without prior discussion might have been a mistake. The girlfriend might have felt pressured, leading her to agree in the moment but then realize she wasn't ready. The author's reaction is understandable, but maybe he should have considered her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes. That's a huge deal and could be hurtful. However, if she wasn't ready and felt pressured, she might be in a tough spot. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe the root cause was his lack of communication. \n\nThe answer depends on whose actions were the main issue. The author's public proposal without discussion might have been the catalyst. So, there's a shared responsibility here. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal beforehand, leading to her feeling pressured, that's where his mistake lies. Therefore, he's partially at fault. But the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn these situations, typically, the person who makes a major decision without communication is seen as at fault. So the author's actions contributed to the problem. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
