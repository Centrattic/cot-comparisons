      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The man planned a public proposal on a cruise without discussing engagement first. The girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind, leading to a breakup. The author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a public proposal with a photographer, which the girlfriend wasn't consulted about. She initially said yes but later didn't want to marry him. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first. He felt she led him on and ended the relationship.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? Well, proposing in a public, planned way without talking to his partner about it first might have been a misstep. Big decisions like marriage should be discussed privately first. The fact that she felt they were moving too quickly suggests he didn't check in with her about their readiness. However, she did say yes, which is a commitment. Changing her mind afterward could be seen as insensitivity. But the question is about who is at fault.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe he should have had the conversation about marriage before the proposal. Public proposals can be nice, but they might not be the best approach if both partners aren't on the same page. So, the author's error was not discussing the engagement first. However, the girlfriend's reaction was also problematic for retracting her acceptance. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have some faults. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the engagement first and set up a public proposal without her input, he shares some responsibility. But the girlfriend retracting her \"yes\" is also a significant issue. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties' actions. Here, the author's approach might have been too abrupt, but the girlfriend's retraction is also a problem. However, the question is whether the author is wrong. If the main issue is not discussing the engagement first, then he might be partially at fault. But since the girlfriend also reversed her decision, maybe the answer isn't straightforward. However, the answer options are binary. \n\nConsidering that the man didn't consult her about the engagement first and planned a public proposal, which she found too fast, he is partly at fault. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's wrong). But wait, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes. Maybe the answer is B (No). Hmm.\n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key point is that he didn't discuss the engagement first. The public proposal without prior discussion is a problem. So he's in the wrong for not checking in with her. Therefore, answer A. But the girlfriend retracting the yes is also bad. However, the question is about who is at fault here. The user wants to know if the author is wrong. So, the answer is A because he didn't have that conversation first.\n"
