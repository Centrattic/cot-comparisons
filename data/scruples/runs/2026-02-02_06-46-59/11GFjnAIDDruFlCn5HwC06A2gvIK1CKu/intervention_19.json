She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. The author ended the relationship, and now they're asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The key points here are the proposal setup, the initial acceptance, the subsequent change of heart, and the argument that followed. The author is upset that she changed her mind after accepting, while she blames him for not discussing the engagement plans first.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want another perspective. So, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a public proposal without prior discussion. The girlfriend felt they were moving too quickly, which might mean she wasn't ready for such a commitment. She accepted in the moment but later realized it wasn't right, which can happen. The author argues that she should have been honest instead of leading him on. She, on the other hand, feels he didn't communicate enough.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he proposed without discussing the engagement, maybe he did move too fast. But once she said yes, changing her mind after the fact could be hurtful. However, people can have moments of clarity or change their minds. The author's reaction of ending the relationship might be extreme, but it's understandable given the emotional impact.\n\nThe \"AITA\" factor often depends on whose actions caused more harm. If he didn't check in with her about his plans, he might have contributed to the situation. But her backing out after accepting is also problematic. However, in many cases, people do change their minds under pressure or in the heat of the moment. The key here is whether she had the right to say \"yes\" and then retract it. Legally and socially, an engagement can be broken by either party, but emotionally, it's devastating.\n\nLooking at relationship advice, communication before big steps is crucial. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her, that's a misstep. However, her retraction after accepting is also a big deal. Both parties might share some responsibility. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe it's a shared blame. However, the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his intent, he's partly to blame. But if she took back her yes, that's her fault. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were the primary cause. Since he didn't discuss the proposal, maybe he's in the wrong for not checking in, leading to her confusion. But if she had the right to renege, then she's at fault. It's a tricky balance. Considering all, I think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because she took back her commitment after accepting, which is hurtful, but he should have discussed the proposal first. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, given that he ended the relationship due to her retraction, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
