      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a guy who proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise, set up a big proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. They celebrated, took pictures, then later she changed her mind and said she didn't want to marry him. He felt broken, cried, asked why she would do that, and she responded that the fault was his for planning a public proposal without discussing the engagement first. He ended the relationship because he found her insensitivity unforgivable. He's asking if he's in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The guy planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. She said yes but then changed her mind. He feels she was insensitive for leading him on. She blames him for rushing things.\n\nFrom her perspective, maybe she felt pressured by the public proposal. She might not have been ready for marriage and the surprise proposal caught her off guard. She could have felt that the public nature of the proposal made it harder to say no, hence her changing her mind later.\n\nFrom his perspective, he put a lot into the proposal, and she led him to believe she was okay with it. When she changed her mind, he felt lied to or disrespected. Ending the relationship because of this is his way of dealing with the betrayal.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author (the guy) in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both parties have some accountability here. The guy did plan a public proposal without discussing it, which might have been a mistake. Proposing in a public setting can be overwhelming for the person being proposed to, especially if they weren't expecting it. So, his approach might have been hasty. On the other hand, once she said yes, even if later she changed her mind, she did have a chance to clarify her feelings instead of leading him on. \n\nBut the crux is: who is at fault here? The guy could be at fault for not discussing the engagement process first, making her feel pressured. She could be at fault for not being honest about her feelings once she agreed. But maybe both contributed. However, the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes, he's in the wrong. If B, then no.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He didn't discuss the proposal with her first, assuming she was ready. That's a common issue where people feel rushed. Her changing her mind might show that she wasn't ready, but her initial acceptance could be a problem. However, the way he ended the relationship because she was \"insensitive\" might be a reaction to her not handling the situation well, but maybe he also didn't take responsibility for his part in pushing for a public proposal without her input.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't have the conversation about marriage first, leading to her feeling pressured. But some might argue B, because she also changed her mind. But the question is about the author's wrongness. If he's in the wrong for not discussing it first, then A. If the main issue is her changing her mind, then B. But given the scenario, the fact that he didn't discuss the proposal with her first is a significant factor. So A might be the correct answer here.\n"
