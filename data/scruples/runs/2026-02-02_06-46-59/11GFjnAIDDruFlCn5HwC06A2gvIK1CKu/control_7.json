      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he proposed during a cruise, set it all up with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The user believes he proposed properly, and she accepted, then later changed her mind. But she says he moved too quickly by not discussing engagement first. He didn't talk to her about the proposal beforehand, which she found problematic. She felt they weren't ready. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for leading him on.\n\nNow, in terms of fault: Proposing is a big step. Usually, couples discuss engagement before a proposal to make sure both are on the same page. If he didn't have that conversation, maybe he did move too quickly. On the other hand, she said yes publicly but then changed her mind, which is hurtful. Her not being ready after accepting might be her fault too. But the user ended it because he couldn't overlook her \"insensitivity,\" which might be his overreaction if she had a valid reason for changing her mind. However, her changing her mind after accepting the proposal is a problem, but maybe he also didn't check if she was ready before proposing.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If he didn't discuss engagement first, then maybe he did move too quickly, which contributed to the problem. But she also didn't communicate her feelings clearly after accepting. In terms of who is more at fault, it's a bit of both, but the question is if the user is in the wrong. The user ended the relationship, which he might see as justified, but if he did proceed without ensuring she was ready, he's partially responsible. However, her taking back her acceptance after a public proposal is also a significant issue. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at communication. If he didn't check in with her about their future before proposing, that's a mistake. However, her going back on her word is also a big problem. The answer might hinge on whether he was in the wrong for not discussing it first. If that's the case, then he's partially at fault. But since the question is whether he is in the wrong (not if both are), maybe the answer is A (Yes, he is in the wrong) if the main issue is his lack of prior discussion. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Alternatively, she is in the wrong for changing her mind after accepting. The user ended the relationship, which is his choice. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the initial question is if the author is in the wrong. If the user proceeded without discussing, then he's at fault. But if she's the one who changed her mind, then maybe not. It's a tricky balance. I think the key point is that he didn't have the conversation first, which she pointed out. So he might be in the wrong for that. But she also didn't communicate her true feelings after accepting. Maybe the answer is A or B. I'm leaning towards A because he didn't check with her first, which she found to be the issue. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, both are at fault, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. So if the answer is A, yes, he is. If it's B, no. I think the main issue here is that he didn't discuss it first, so he's partially at fault. Therefore, answer A.\n"
