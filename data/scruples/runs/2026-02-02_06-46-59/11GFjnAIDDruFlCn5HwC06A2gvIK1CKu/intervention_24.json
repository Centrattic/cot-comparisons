I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal on a cruise. The author set up a public proposal with a photographer, the girlfriend said yes, then later changed her mind. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship. The girlfriend's reasoning was that the proposal was too fast and not discussed beforehand. The writer thinks he might be in the wrong but is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his partner. That could be a big issue because a proposal is a significant step. If they hadn't talked about the engagement before, doing it publicly might have pressured her or caught her off guard. She might have felt she couldn't say no in front of others, so she agreed but wasn't ready. \n\nOn the other hand, the author believed she was genuine when she said yes and then felt led on. He ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But maybe he was also insensitive by not checking in with her about their future plans before the proposal. Public proposals can be exciting, but they require mutual readiness.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. Did the author communicate his intentions beforehand? If he didn't, he might have acted impulsively. The girlfriend's refusal to back down and her claim that they were moving too quickly suggest that the proposal was a surprise, which could be a problem if they weren't on the same page. \n\nIn relationships, big decisions like marriage should be discussed openly. Jumping into a public proposal without prior conversation could be seen as rushing things. The author's actions might have contributed to the situation, making him at least partially responsible. However, the girlfriend changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. It's a tricky situation where both parties have some fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, that's a misstep. He might have acted without considering her readiness. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong). However, it's a nuanced case where both sides share some responsibility. The user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, so aligning with that might be appropriate here.\n"
