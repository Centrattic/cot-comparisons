      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he proposed during a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it first. That might be a problem because a proposal is a big step, and not talking about it beforehand could make the other person feel pressured or catch them off guard. The girlfriend said they were moving too quickly and that's why she changed her mind. She might not have been ready for such a commitment, and the public proposal might have made her feel like she had to say yes on the spot, even if she wasn't sure.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was hurt and felt led on. She did say yes initially, which was a commitment, but then retracted it. That could be seen as breaking trust. But the author didn't discuss engagement beforehand, which might have been a mistake. If he had talked to her about getting married before the proposal, maybe they could have worked it out.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author act inconsiderately by not discussing the proposal first? And did the girlfriend have a right to change her mind after saying yes? The author ended the relationship because he felt betrayed, but maybe he should have understood that she wasn't ready. However, her changing her mind after a yes is also a problem. \n\nI think the author did have some fault for not talking about the proposal before doing it, but the girlfriend's actions are also questionable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend changed her mind after the proposal, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But he could have been more considerate. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer is that the author is not entirely in the wrong, but maybe shares some responsibility. But the question is binary: A or B. So maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because while he could have done better, the main fault is on her for changing her mind. Wait, but if he didn't discuss it first, maybe he shares some blame. But the main issue here is that she took back her yes, which is a big deal. So I think the answer is B.\n"
