      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal gone wrong.\n\nFirst, the guy planned a big, public proposal on a cruise with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, they celebrated, then later she changed her mind. The guy is upset and broke up with her, thinking she was insensitve. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nHmm. So, who's at fault here? Well, the guy did plan a big proposal without talking to her first. She might have felt pressured. She said yes in the moment, maybe out of excitement, but then realized she wasn't ready. But then she didn't want to marry him, leading to the heartbreak.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy was hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. She didn't communicate her feelings properly. But the man didn't check in with her before the proposal either. Maybe he should have discussed the engagement plans with her beforehand instead of surprising her.\n\nI think both sides have some accountability. The man should have talked to her about his intentions earlier, and she should have been honest about her readiness. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author ended the relationship because of her actions, but his proposal was also a surprise without prior discussion.\n\nBut the key point is that she said yes publicly, then changed her mind. That's a big deal. However, if he hadn't pressured her by springing it on her, maybe she would have had time to think. But she didn't communicate before the proposal. So, maybe she's the one in the wrong for not being honest when he proposed, but the man also didn't communicate his plan. However, the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. Since he ended the relationship because she was insensitve, but his actions also contributed. But I think the main issue here is her changing her mind after saying yes. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The man's actions were a bit impulsive, but her retracting her yes caused the hurt. So he's not in the wrong for ending the relationship because of her inconsiderate behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
