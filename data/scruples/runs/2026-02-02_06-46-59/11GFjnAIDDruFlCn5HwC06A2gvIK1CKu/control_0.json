      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong according to the situation described. The author proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The author is upset because she didn't go through with it and ended the relationship because of her insensitivity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it first. The girlfriend felt that the author moved too quickly and wasn't ready, leading her to retract her \"yes.\"\n\nThe author argues that the girlfriend led him on and was insensitive. The girlfriend's side is that the proposal was a surprise and she wasn't ready. In relationships, communication is key. Proposing without discussing the future commitment might have been a misstep on the author's part. However, once the proposal happened and she accepted, changing her mind could be seen as breaking trust.\n\nBut the author ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, which might be valid if she didn't communicate her feelings beforehand. However, ending a relationship over this could be extreme. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The author didn't discuss the proposal, which could have led to the confusion. The girlfriend didn't communicate her feelings about moving too fast until after the proposal. The author's reaction to end the relationship is a personal choice, but the initial proposal without discussion might have been a mistake. However, the girlfriend retracting her acceptance after saying yes is also problematic as it's a betrayal of trust.\n\nBut according to common advice, proposing without discussing it first is a common mistake in relationships, leading to misunderstandings. The girlfriend's decision to change her mind after accepting could be seen as insensitivity as well. However, the author's action of ending the relationship because of her reaction might be justified if he felt betrayed. However, in this case, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't discuss the proposal, that's on him, but the girlfriend's retraction after accepting is more about her actions. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the main issue was the lack of communication prior to the proposal, but the girlfriend's actions after are also at fault. However, the author ending the relationship is a personal decision, but the initial setup of the proposal without discussion is where the fault might lie. Alternatively, the girlfriend's refusal to communicate her feelings before the proposal is her fault. So the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the main fault is on the girlfriend for changing her mind after accepting, and the author's decision to end the relationship is a reaction to her insensitivity. But the initial setup might have been a mistake. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The common AITA (Am I the Asshole) threads often look at who started the conflict. The author's setup without discussion is a red flag, but the girlfriend's retraction is the main issue. Maybe the answer is B because the author isn't entirely to blame for the proposal setup, but the main conflict is the girlfriend's actions after accepting. Alternatively, the author could be in the wrong for not discussing it first. I think in this case, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the main problem is the girlfriend's retraction after accepting, but there's a nuance here. However, since the question is about the author's wrongness, and the setup of the proposal without discussion might be a contributing factor, but the main issue is the girlfriend's actions. So the answer is B.\n"
