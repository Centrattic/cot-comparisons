      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal gone wrong. The man proposed during a cruise with a setup, and she said yes but then changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The man set up a public proposal without discussing engagement first. The woman felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. She might have said yes in the moment but realized she wasn't ready later. The man is upset because he feels betrayed, but maybe she was honest in the moment but changed her mind.\n\nIn terms of fault, there's the question of communication. Proposing publicly without prior discussion could be seen as rushed, especially if the woman wasn't ready. However, she did say yes initially. Then, after the initial excitement, she changed her mind. It's possible she wasn't in the right frame of mind or felt pressured. The man ended it because he felt she was insensitive, but she might have been honest about her feelings once she had time to think.\n\nThe woman's argument is that the proposal was sudden and public, which made her uncomfortable. The man's argument is that she led him on by saying yes and then backing out. Is the man in the wrong for not discussing engagement beforehand? Maybe. Proposals should ideally be discussed in advance to ensure both parties are on the same page. If he didn't talk to her about marriage first, that's a problem. However, she did say yes, so that's a commitment, and changing her mind after that could be seen as insensitivity.\n\nBut maybe she was scared or overwhelmed in the moment. Sometimes people agree to things in the heat of the moment and later realize they're not ready. The man ended the relationship, which is a big decision. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the proposal was a mistake for not discussing it first and if her change of heart was reasonable.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The question is about the author (the man) being in the wrong. If he didn't discuss engagement before proposing, that's his fault. But if she changed her mind after saying yes, that's her fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points are communication and intent. Proposing without discussion might be a mistake, leading to the situation. However, her backing out could also be a problem. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the main issue is the lack of prior communication, making the author partially at fault. But the woman's responsibility to be honest and not say yes if she's not ready is also important. \n\nIn some opinions, the man should have discussed the proposal with her first. Others might say that she should have been honest from the start. Since she did say yes, even if she later changed her mind, it's a breach of trust. But the setup of the proposal without discussion might be the root cause. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not checking in first, making him at least partly responsible. The answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No). Given the setup without discussion, maybe A is the answer.\n"
