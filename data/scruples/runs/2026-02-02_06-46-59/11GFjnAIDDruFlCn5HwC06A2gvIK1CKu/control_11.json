      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation where his ex-girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a proposal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author planned a public proposal during a cruise, including a photographer and champagne. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author is upset because she didn't follow through, while she argues that the public proposal made her feel pressured and that they were moving too quickly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the method of proposal (public vs. private), communication before the proposal, and the emotional impact on both parties.\n\nThe author's argument is that she led him on by accepting the proposal and then backing out. He ended the relationship because he feels she was insensitive. The girlfriend's side is that the public proposal wasn't discussed beforehand, making her feel like he wasn't considering her readiness. She claims they were moving too fast and she wasn't ready, which she didn't realize until after accepting.\n\nNow, societal norms often suggest that a proposal should be discussed beforehand, not just sprung as a surprise. If the author didn't talk to her about engagement plans before the public proposal, that might have been a misstep. Proposing publicly without prior discussion could create pressure, making her feel like she couldn't say no without embarrassment. That could explain why she said yes in the moment but later reconsidered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is justified in feeling hurt because he put a lot into the proposal and trusted her acceptance. Ending the relationship because of her change of heart might be seen as a reaction to broken trust, but he didn't address the underlying issues. Maybe he should have communicated more before the proposal to ensure they were both on the same page about marriage.\n\nThe girlfriend's refusal to acknowledge his feelings and her insistence that it was his fault could indicate a lack of empathy. However, her initial hesitation might be valid if they weren't ready for marriage. The problem is that the proposal wasn't discussed, leading to her feeling pressured.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author's mistake was not discussing the proposal with her first. Public proposals can be beautiful, but they require mutual understanding. By not checking in with her about marriage intentions, he might have set the stage for this conflict. However, her taking back her acceptance after the proposal also shows a lack of commitment once the pressure was off, which is hurtful.\n\nSo, while both parties have valid points, the author's decision not to discuss the proposal beforehand contributed to the situation. The girlfriend's change of heart is also a problem, but if the proposal was properly discussed, maybe the outcome would have been different. Therefore, the author shares some responsibility for not ensuring mutual readiness before the public commitment.\n"
