      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a proposal gone wrong. The guy proposed on a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and the girl said yes at first. Then later, she changed her mind and they broke up. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She initially said yes during the proposal but later backed out. He got hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she was insincere. She, on the other hand, said they were moving too fast and he didn't talk to her about the engagement first. \n\nNow, considering both perspectives. The man's actions could be seen as impulsive. Proposing in such a public way without prior discussion might have pressured her. Maybe she wasn't ready for that step and felt cornered. Her changing her mind after the initial yes could be because she realized the engagement wasn't right for her. But then, why didn't she address it immediately? She did say they were moving too fast, so maybe she wasn't lying but just not prepared. \n\nOn the other hand, the man's reaction to ending the relationship because she changed her mind might be a bit harsh. He was hurt, which is understandable, but cutting off a relationship over this could be seen as not allowing her to explain or work through the issue. However, he felt she was insensitively leading him on. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the man hadn't discussed the engagement with her beforehand, that's a problem. Public proposals can be romantic, but they might not be the best way to have a serious conversation about the future. The girl might have felt pressured and then later realized she wasn't ready, so she backed out. But then, she could have clarified her feelings immediately instead of letting him get hopes up. \n\nThe man ending the relationship because she changed her mind might be his way of protecting himself, given the hurt. However, maybe he could have had a more open conversation to understand her perspective. But given the context of her saying she wasn't ready and not addressing it earlier, maybe he wasn't wrong to end things. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girl's actions of changing her mind after the initial yes might be flawed, but the man's planning the proposal without discussing it first is also a factor. However, the user's original thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want confirmation. \n\nI think the key here is that the man didn't discuss his intentions with her, leading to her feeling blindsided. That's a mistake. But then, her changing her mind after the fact is also problematic. However, since the question is about the author's wrongness, the fact that he didn't communicate his plans first is a significant issue. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not discussing it. But the answer options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no). \n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is A. Because the man's failure to communicate his intentions before the proposal is a key factor here. The girl's response is a consequence of that. So, the author's actions (not discussing engagement first) led to the situation. So he's in the wrong. But then again, the user thinks he's in the wrong, which aligns with option A. So the answer is A.\n"
