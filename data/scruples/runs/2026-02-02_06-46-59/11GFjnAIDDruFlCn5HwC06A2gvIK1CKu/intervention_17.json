I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who proposed and then ended the relationship) is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed during a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He felt hurt and ended the relationship. The key points here are the public proposal without discussing it first and her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which might have been a big surprise. She said yes, but then changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nOn one hand, proposing in a public setting can be overwhelming. Maybe he didn't give her a chance to process it in a private, calm environment. Public proposals can be stressful and might not be the best way to have such a serious conversation. She might have felt pressured to say yes on the spot, especially in front of others. Later, when she realized she wasn't ready, she retracted her acceptance. That could be seen as a breach of trust, but if she felt pressured, maybe she didn't have the chance to think it through properly.\n\nOn the other hand, she did say yes initially, which is a big commitment. Changing her mind after accepting might be hurtful. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014he was excited and then devastated. However, ending the relationship immediately after a conflict might not give both parties a chance to communicate their feelings further. But given the situation, maybe the author felt it was necessary to walk away from someone who was insensitive to his feelings.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might argue that she had the right to change her mind if she wasn't ready. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which could have been a better approach. Planning a proposal without prior discussion might have led to the misunderstanding. However, her retracting the \"yes\" after the proposal could be seen as her being in the wrong as well.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The author could have discussed the proposal with her first to ensure they were on the same page. She, on the other hand, accepted the proposal and then changed her mind, which is hurtful. But considering the pressure of a public proposal, maybe she wasn't given the time to think it through. \n\nThe author's decision to break up because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity is a strong move. It shows he prioritizes honesty in communication. However, the way he ended things immediately might not have allowed for a more constructive conversation. \n\nOverall, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is the public proposal without prior discussion, then the author might share some fault. But if the issue is her retracting the acceptance, she might be at fault. However, given that the author didn't seek her input before proposing, his actions could be seen as contributing to the problem. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't discuss the proposal first, leading to her feeling pressured. But others might argue that she should have been more committed once she said yes. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author having some responsibility for the approach he took.\n"
