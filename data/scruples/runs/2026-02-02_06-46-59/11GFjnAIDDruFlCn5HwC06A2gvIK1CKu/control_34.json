      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to his proposal. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, he proposed on a cruise in a public setting with a photographer. She said yes, but later changed her mind. He was really happy and did the celebration stuff, then found out she didn't actually want to get married. She blamed him for rushing into things without discussing the engagement first. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nSo, the main points here are about whether the author made a mistake by not talking about the engagement before proposing, and whether her reversing her decision was wrong. The user wants to know if he's the asshole (AITA) or if she is.\n\nIn relationships, proposing is a huge step. Typically, it's expected that both partners are on the same page regarding the level of commitment. If he proposed without prior discussion, maybe that's where the issue started. But she did say yes initially, which could mean she had some mixed feelings and then realized she wasn't ready. However, taking back a \"yes\" after a proposal is pretty serious. Once someone says yes, it's a commitment, even if it's later taken back. \n\nOn the other hand, her argument is that he moved too quickly. Proposing without having the conversation about marriage and what it entails could be seen as her not having the chance to express her true feelings. But once she said yes, she should have been sure, right? Or maybe people can have emotional reactions in the moment and need time to think. \n\nThe author ended the relationship immediately because he felt her insensitivity. Insensitivity here might refer to her not being honest sooner or not considering how this would affect him. But she might feel that he didn't respect her boundaries by not discussing it first. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't talk about marriage before the proposal, that's a problem. But once she said yes, retracting it could be hurtful. However, people's minds can change, especially if they feel pressured. The key is whether the author pressured her or not. The setup was public, maybe she felt cornered. If they hadn't discussed the future before, then maybe he rushed it. But she also gave a yes and then changed her mind. \n\nThis is a tough call. Both might share some responsibility. The author didn't have the pre-talk, which is important. She might not have been honest about her feelings even after saying yes. But the immediate breakup could be hasty. However, from his perspective, the betrayal is significant. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author planned a public proposal without discussing it first, which is a mistake. But she retracting the yes is also a problem. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the question is phrased as the author ending the relationship due to her insensitivity, maybe the majority would say the author isn't in the wrong because he acted on a proposal that was accepted publicly and then denied, which is a breach of trust. But some might argue that not discussing it first was a mistake. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the one who made the other person feel led on is in the wrong. Since she said yes and then changed her mind, that's the bigger issue here. The author might not be in the wrong for not having the conversation before, but the proposal was planned without her input, which could be a problem. But the immediate breakup because of her taking back the yes might be justified. \n\nHmm, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because her taking back the \"yes\" after a public proposal is a big deal, and he ended things because of the insensitivity, which is her part. But maybe the fact that he didn't talk to her about the engagement first is a mistake. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so if the answer is B, that would mean he isn't. But some people might say that he should have had the conversation first. \n\nI think the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong. Her changing her mind after saying yes is the main issue, and he had the right to end the relationship due to the emotional harm caused. However, there's a nuance where the public proposal without discussion might have contributed, but the key is her insensitivity in taking back the commitment. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
