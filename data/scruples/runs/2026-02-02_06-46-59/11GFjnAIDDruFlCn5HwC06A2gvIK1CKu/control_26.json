She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who proposed) is in the wrong when his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a public proposal.\n\nFirst, the setup: They were on a cruise, he planned a proposal with a photographer, she said yes, they celebrated, but later she changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. She blames him for not discussing the proposal first and moving too quickly.\n\nSo, who's at fault? Well, the author did plan a public proposal without discussing it with her. Public proposals can be seen as pressuring someone or not considering their feelings. If they hadn't talked about marriage before, maybe she wasn't ready, and the public setting made her feel cornered. She might have said yes in the moment but later realized she wasn't committed. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt betrayed because she didn't follow through. But maybe she was honest in the end, even if it was painful. The key points are communication and mutual readiness. If they hadn't discussed future plans, the proposal might have been a surprise that wasn't aligned with her readiness. The author could be in the wrong for not checking in with her about marriage before the proposal. She might have been truthful when she changed her mind, even if it hurt him. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not having the conversation first. The ex's action of retracting the yes was hard, but maybe it was honest. Therefore, the author might share some blame for not ensuring mutual readiness. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, that's a point against him. However, she could be wrong for changing her mind after accepting publicly. But since she did explain her reasoning, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But the main issue is his lack of prior discussion. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't talk to her about the proposal first.\n"
