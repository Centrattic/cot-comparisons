      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man proposing to his girlfriend during a cruise, setting up a public proposal with a photographer. She says yes, they celebrate, but later she backs out, saying she's not ready. He's heartbroken, ends the relationship, and accuses her of insensitivity. She, on the other hand, says he moved too quickly without discussing the engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The man put a lot of effort into planning a public proposal, which was a big commitment. He believed she was okay with moving towards marriage because she said yes. However, she later changed her mind, which caused him emotional pain. He feels she led him on and was insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman's perspective is that the proposal was public and planned without discussing the engagement first. She felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready for marriage. She might have said yes in the moment due to the romantic setup but realized later that she wasn't prepared for such a lifelong commitment.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Proposing is a significant step, and ideally, both partners should have a conversation about the future before such a proposal. A public proposal can be exciting, but if there's underlying hesitation or if the proposal is a surprise without prior discussion, it might not be the best approach. The man might have assumed she was ready, but he didn't check in with her about their future plans. The woman might have felt pressured in the moment, especially in a public setting, and later realized she wasn't ready.\n\nBut then, once she said yes, even if it was a mistake, retracting it after celebrations could be hurtful. However, she might not have been in a place where she could give a genuine commitment. The man ending the relationship because of her change of heart might be a reaction to feeling betrayed, but it's also about mutual readiness for marriage.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. The man didn't discuss engagement plans beforehand, leading to a surprise proposal. The woman didn't communicate her unpreparedness more clearly before the proposal. However, once the proposal happened and she accepted, backing out later without a strong reason might be seen as insensitivity. But if she was not ready at all, then the problem might be that he moved too quickly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate if the man's actions were the main issue. The key points are: public proposal without prior discussion, leading to a yes he believed was genuine, but she later retracted. The woman's response about moving too fast suggests that the issue was about readiness, not insensitivity. Ending the relationship because she changed her mind might be his reaction to feeling used or betrayed.\n\nIn many relationships, communication is key. If the man assumed she was ready without talking about it, he might have acted prematurely. However, after she said yes and then changed her mind, her actions could be seen as breaking trust. But if she wasn't ready, maybe the problem was that they weren't on the same page about the commitment. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say the man is in the wrong for not ensuring mutual readiness before the proposal, while others might argue the woman is at fault for retracting her acceptance. However, the fact that she didn't want to marry him after saying yes could be more hurtful. But if they had discussed it beforehand, maybe this situation could have been avoided.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the man's lack of prior communication was the main issue or if the woman's retraction was the main problem. If the answer is A (author is in the wrong), then the man's actions in not discussing the engagement first led to the conflict. If B (not in the wrong), then the woman's insensitivity after accepting the proposal is the main issue.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe they believe the man should have discussed engagement plans before proposing. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. Alternatively, if the author is in the wrong for the proposal method, then A. If the woman is in the wrong for retracting, then B.\n\nGiven that, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But the analysis might lead to a different conclusion. However, based on the scenario, the man ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but if she wasn't ready, maybe the problem was mutual. But the key point is whether he's in the wrong for his actions. Since the woman said yes, then changed her mind, he might argue she's in the wrong. But if he didn't check in with her before the proposal, he might share responsibility.\n"
