      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, set it up with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he did everything right, planned a proposal, got a yes, but then she took it back. He's hurt and ended the relationship. The woman's perspective is that she wasn't ready, and he moved too fast without discussing it. She might feel pressured into saying yes in the moment because of the public setup.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. I should evaluate if planning a public proposal without prior discussion about engagement is wrong. Traditionally, engagement is a big step, and some people might think it's important to have that conversation first. However, others might argue that a proposal is a natural progression if both are in a committed relationship. The woman's reaction suggests she wasn't ready, so the author might have overlooked her readiness. \n\nBut then, she said yes and then changed her mind. The author might feel betrayed that she didn't mean it. The key points here are communication and mutual readiness. If the author didn't check in with her about the big step of marriage first, maybe he did move too fast. But if she didn't communicate her feelings properly during the proposal, she's also at fault. The question is whether the author is wrong for planning the proposal without discussing it. \n\nSome people might say that a proposal should be a shared decision, so the author could be in the wrong for not getting her input. Others might say that if she said yes, it was a valid proposal, and changing her mind later is her fault. However, the fact that she changed her mind so quickly after the yes might indicate that she wasn't truly committed, so the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nBut considering the setup was public, maybe he put pressure on her, making her say yes in the moment. So the author's approach might have contributed to the problem. Therefore, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were considered moving too fast without proper discussion. The user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, and I need to see if that's supported. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't talk about the proposal plans and the step towards marriage, that's a misstep. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, leading to her feeling pressured. Alternatively, if the woman is to blame for changing her mind, then the answer is B. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the woman's reason is that he moved too fast without discussing, that implies the author's fault. So the answer would be A.\n"
