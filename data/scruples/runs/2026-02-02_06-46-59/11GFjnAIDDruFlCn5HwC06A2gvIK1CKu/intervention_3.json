      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal during a cruise, where the girlfriend initially said yes but then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt led on and she refused to listen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author planned a public proposal, which can be seen as a significant commitment. The girlfriend said yes at first but later changed her mind, which is confusing and hurtful. The author feels she led him on without discussing the engagement first. She, on the other hand, might feel that the public proposal was too rushed and that the author didn't consider her readiness for marriage.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, he was excited and followed through with a proposal he had planned, expecting a positive outcome. When she changed her mind, he felt broken and betrayed. His reaction is understandable due to the emotional investment and the public nature of the proposal. Ending the relationship because of her insensitivity makes sense from his perspective.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is also important. She said yes initially but then changed her mind, which could indicate she wasn't fully committed. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her beforehand, which might have contributed to her feeling pressured. Proposing in a public setting without prior discussion could be seen as moving too quickly, especially if she wasn't ready for marriage.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual readiness. If the author didn't talk to her about their future and marriage plans before the proposal, he might have assumed she was ready. The girlfriend might have felt the proposal was abrupt, leading to her mixed reactions. The author's decision to end the relationship is a reaction to her not being honest or communicative, but perhaps he also didn't set the right foundation for such a big step.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it's a bit of a joint responsibility. The author didn't discuss the proposal properly, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her feelings beforehand. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he acted based on the initial yes but didn't have prior discussions, there's a case that he rushed into it without ensuring mutual readiness. On the other hand, her changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't have prior communication about marriage intentions, contributing to the situation. However, there's nuance where both parties could have communicated better. But since the question is about the author's fault specifically, the answer leans towards A.\n"
