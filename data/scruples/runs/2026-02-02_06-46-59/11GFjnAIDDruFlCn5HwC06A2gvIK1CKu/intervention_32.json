I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal that was accepted but then retracted. The writer proposed publicly without discussing it with his girlfriend first, leading to her changing her mind later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The writer set up a public proposal, which might have been a surprise, but he didn't talk about marriage plans beforehand. The girlfriend said \"yes\" but then changed her mind, explaining she wasn't ready and felt they were moving too fast. She blamed the proposal method for the pressure, while the writer thought she was insensitive for leading him on.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing without prior discussion about marriage could be seen as a misstep. Even though the proposal was a surprise, not discussing it beforehand might have left the girlfriend unprepared to handle the commitment. On the other hand, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal is also significant. Saying \"yes\" in the moment and then changing your mind can be hurtful and confusing.\n\nThe girlfriend might have felt pressured by the public setting, which could affect her decision-making. The writer, however, didn't consider her readiness and reacted emotionally, ending the relationship. Both parties have valid points. The writer's lack of communication about marriage plans and the girlfriend's retraction without considering his feelings could both contribute to the situation.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal with her, which is a major life decision, he might have overlooked her readiness. However, breaking up immediately after might be a reaction to the pain, not necessarily the right decision. But the core issue is the lack of prior communication about marriage. So, maybe the writer is at least partially in the wrong for not discussing it beforehand. But the girlfriend's retraction is also problematic. \n\nIn many cases, proposals should be discussed beforehand to ensure both parties are on the same page. The public proposal without prior discussion could be seen as inconsiderate, leading to her change of heart. Therefore, the writer might be in the wrong for not having that conversation first.\n"
