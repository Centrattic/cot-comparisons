She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that was accepted but then retracted by the girlfriend. The writer proposes during a cruise with a setup, gets a \"yes,\" but then the girlfriend changes her mind. He feels hurt and ends the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity. She claims the fault is his for not discussing the proposal first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The writer took a significant step by planning a public proposal without prior discussion. That could be seen as pressuring or rushing the relationship, which the girlfriend might not have been ready for. On the other hand, he was genuinely excited and believed she was willing to commit, leading to emotional distress when she changed her mind. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that the public proposal wasn't discussed, making her feel blindsided. This could be a valid point because a proposal is a major life decision and discussing it beforehand is crucial. However, after she initially said yes, retracting it might be seen as inconsiderate, given the emotional investment and the public commitment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are communication and mutual readiness. If the author didn't talk to her about marriage before proposing, that's a mistake. But once she said yes and then took it back, that's a different issue. The author's decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity might be justified if he felt she was emotionally unavailable. However, perhaps he should have handled the situation with more understanding, considering her change of heart after a public commitment. \n\nIn relationships, engagement is a big step. Proposing without a prior conversation about readiness for marriage could lead to misunderstandings. The author's mistake might be not discussing this first. However, the girlfriend retracting her acceptance could also be hurtful. The responsibility isn't entirely on one side. But in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), if the author didn't talk to her before the proposal, he shares some responsibility. However, if the issue was that she retracted after accepting, maybe she's in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so if the author didn't discuss the proposal first, that's his fault. So the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But if the main issue is her retraction, then B (No). It's a bit of a toss-up, but the initial proposal without discussion is a key point. Hence, A might be the answer.\n"
