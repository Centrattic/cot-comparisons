      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (the one who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal on a cruise. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author planned a public proposal with a photographer, which the girlfriend accepted. They celebrated, but later she changed her mind, saying they were moving too fast. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship, blaming her for being insensitive. She, on the other hand, felt the proposal was rushed without discussing it first.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Let's break it down. The key points are: the proposal was public, planned without prior discussion, and the girlfriend felt pressured. The author might have assumed she was ready for marriage without checking in, while she felt he didn't consider her readiness. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't talk about marriage plans and instead sprung a public proposal, that could catch her off guard. Public proposals can be exciting but might also create pressure, especially if both partners haven't had the serious conversation about their future. The girlfriend might have said yes in the moment but later realized it wasn't right because they hadn't discussed it. \n\nOn the flip side, the author was hurt and ended the relationship, which is a big decision. He might feel betrayed by her changing her answer. But was it his fault for not discussing the proposal first? If he assumed she was ready without confirming, he might have contributed to the situation. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could be valid if she felt pressured into a decision without being fully prepared. However, once she said yes, retracting it later could be seen as hurtful, but maybe she wasn't in the right frame of mind. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author didn't discuss the proposal beforehand, which led to her feeling rushed. The girlfriend changed her mind, which hurt him, but maybe she had valid reasons. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is that he didn't communicate his intentions and she felt pressured, then he might share some responsibility. But if the problem is her retracting the acceptance and being insensitive, then she might be at fault. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for not having the conversation first. Proposing publicly can be a big surprise, but it's important to ensure both partners are on the same page. The girlfriend's hesitation might stem from that lack of prior discussion. However, ending the relationship over this might be a consequence of both their actions. \n\nGiven that the user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. If the author's mistake was not discussing the proposal, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if the main issue is her retracting the yes, then he's not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't communicate properly. So, answer A.\n"
