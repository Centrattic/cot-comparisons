      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong. The person set up a public proposal on a cruise, the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The writer ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The writer planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. That might have been a mistake. Proposing is a big step, and doing it publicly without prior discussion could pressure the other person. The girlfriend might have felt unprepared, leading her to say yes in the moment but then realize she wasn't ready. She could be in the wrong for not being honest during the proposal, but maybe the writer also didn't give her enough time to think.\n\nThe writer ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But was it his fault for not talking about engagement first? The girlfriend's reaction suggests she wasn't ready for marriage. The writer was upset, but ending the relationship immediately after such a shock might be a reaction based on hurt feelings. However, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. \n\nPublic proposals can be romantic, but they do require mutual communication. If the writer didn't check in with her about marriage before the proposal, he might have contributed to the situation. On the other hand, the girlfriend's last-minute change of heart is also a problem. It's a tough call. The writer's anger at being led on is understandable, but maybe he could have handled it differently instead of ending the relationship right away. However, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend changed her answer after the proposal, it's her who didn't follow through. The writer's action of ending the relationship might be his right, given the hurt. So, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
