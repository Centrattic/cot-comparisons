      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that the girlfriend initially said yes to but then changed her mind. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy planned a public proposal on a cruise with a photographer. He was excited, and she said yes. Then, after the celebration, she backed out. He felt broken and ended the relationship because he thought she led him on. She responded by saying it was his fault for rushing things without discussing it first. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Well, proposing is a big step, and doing it publicly can be a lot. The guy might have assumed she was ready, but maybe she wasn't. However, once she said yes, it's a commitment. If she changed her mind after accepting, that's a problem. On the other hand, proposing without discussing it first could be an issue too. Maybe they weren't on the same page about moving forward. \n\nThe user is asking for a judgment between A (the author is wrong) and B (not wrong). The key points are whether the author is in the wrong for proposing without discussing it first, and whether the ex is wrong for changing her mind. \n\nI think both could have communicated better. The guy might have rushed into a public proposal without checking if she was ready for marriage. But once she said yes, retracting it after the fact is hurtful. However, the ex saying it was his fault for moving too fast might be part of the problem. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. If he didn't consult her before proposing, that's a mistake. But the main issue here is her taking back her \"yes.\" The author ended the relationship because she was insensitive. In that case, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he should have discussed the proposal first, maybe he is. \n\nHmm, it's a tough one. The public proposal without prior discussion could be a red flag. If the author had talked to her about marriage first, maybe this wouldn't have happened. So he might be partially at fault. But the fact that she changed her mind after saying yes is also a significant problem. \n\nI think the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the main issue is her retraction after accepting. However, the author's approach could have been better. But according to the story, he ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. Since she was the one who changed her mind, maybe he's justified. So the answer is B.\n"
