      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong. The author set up a public proposal during a cruise, the girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship, blaming the ex for leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a big, public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. The ex says she wasn't ready and they were moving too quickly. The author argues she should have communicated her feelings earlier, but she blames him for not talking about the engagement first.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing in a public setting without discussing engagement plans might be seen as rushing things, especially if the partner hasn't been given a chance to express their readiness. However, the ex's reaction of saying yes and then backing out is also problematic. Once she said yes, changing her mind after the fact could be seen as insincere or not being clear about her intentions.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because of the hurt and feeling led on. The ex's refusal to listen and her initial reaction might have contributed to the breakup. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, planning a public proposal without discussion could be impulsive, which might have caused stress for the ex. But the ex's change of heart after saying yes is also a significant factor. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that the author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook the insensitivity might indicate that both have valid points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex didn't communicate her feelings clearly and the author didn't check in with her about their future plans before proposing, it's a shared responsibility. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. But considering that the ex changed her mind after publicly agreeing, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to check again. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess objectively. The key points are lack of prior discussion about engagement and the ex's change of heart. If the author had discussed engagement plans first, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But the ex's response after saying yes is also a problem. So, maybe the author shares some blame, but is he entirely in the wrong? The question is whether he is in the wrong, not if both are. Since the ex also has issues, maybe the answer is B (No), meaning the author is not in the wrong, but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the author is partially at fault, but the main question is whether he's in the wrong, then maybe A is the answer. Hmm. I think the answer is B because the ex's behavior was also problematic, and the author's decision to end the relationship is a reaction to her actions. But I'm not sure. Let me see. The options are A or B. Given that the author acted on his own without discussing engagement plans, but the ex's response was also hurtful. The author's actions might be seen as impulsive, but the ex's change of heart is also a major issue. So maybe the answer is B. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because the ex also had a role, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the analysis shows it's not entirely his fault, maybe the answer is B.\n"
