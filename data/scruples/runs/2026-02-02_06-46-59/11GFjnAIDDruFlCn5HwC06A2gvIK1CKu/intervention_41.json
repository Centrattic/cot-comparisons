      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal during a cruise, which the girlfriend initially accepts but then changes her mind. The author is upset and blames her for leading him on, while she claims the proposal was too public and they were moving too fast.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. That could be seen as a mistake because a proposal is a significant step that usually requires mutual discussion. By not talking about it beforehand, he might have assumed she was ready, which she wasn't. On the other hand, she said \"yes\" and then changed her mind, which is confusing. Why would she say yes if she wasn't ready? Maybe she was surprised and then realized she wasn't committed. However, after a proposal, retracting the acceptance can be hurtful and damaging to trust. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. Is that justified? If she wasn't ready for marriage, she should have been honest. But he also didn't discuss the proposal first, which could have led to this situation. So both parties have some responsibility. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nHe blames her for leading him on, but he didn't check if she was ready. However, retracting a \"yes\" is a big deal. The key point is that he didn't communicate his intentions first. If he had talked to her about marriage before the proposal, maybe they could have avoided this. So, maybe he's partially at fault for not discussing engagement plans. But she's also responsible for not being honest. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the analysis, the author did make a mistake by not discussing the proposal first, which contributed to the situation. However, she also retracted her acceptance, which is problematic. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A because he didn't communicate properly. But some might argue it's a shared fault. However, the options are A or B, not both. Since the user thinks A is correct, and the author's failure to discuss the proposal is a key point, the answer is likely A.\n"
