      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went bad.\n\nSo, the guy planned a big public proposal on a cruise. He set up everything with a photographer, etc. She said yes, then later changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship. She said he was at fault for not discussing the engagement first and moving too quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. Proposals are big life decisions and usually require mutual understanding. The guy didn't talk about the engagement beforehand, just did a surprise proposal. The girl said she wasn't ready, and he thought she was insensitive for changing her mind after the yes.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, proposing without discussing it first might have been a mistake. Maybe he should have talked to her about his intentions before going public. On the other hand, she agreed to the proposal, then changed her mind. That's a big flip, which can be hurtful. But she did explain her reasoning\u2014moving too quickly. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author ended the relationship because of her \"insensitivity\". But maybe the main issue is both sides. The guy didn't discuss the proposal, she didn't clarify her feelings in time. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if both are. \n\nIn some perspectives, the proposal should be a mutual decision. If he didn't talk to her first, maybe he's responsible for assuming she wanted to get engaged. But once he proposed and she said yes, changing her mind later is also a problem. \n\nBut the key here is the aftermath. He ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. She was honest about not being ready. Maybe he's being too harsh, or she's not handling it well. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, sometimes the person who didn't communicate their needs is considered at fault. The guy didn't check if she was ready, but she didn't express her hesitation either. However, the act of changing her mind after a yes and a public commitment could be seen as her being in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is about the author's fault. The author didn't discuss the engagement first, which could be his mistake. However, the immediate reaction of ending the relationship because she changed her mind might be seen as his overreaction. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) if the main issue is her changing her mind after agreeing. But if the problem is that he didn't discuss it first, then A. But I think the main fault here is hers for changing her mind after the commitment, but the guy's lack of discussion could be a contributing factor. However, in AITA contexts, the person who breaks their partner's heart might be seen as wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the guy didn't check in with her before the proposal, he shares some responsibility. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer might be A if he is, but B if he's not. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is A because he didn't talk to her first. But maybe B because she changed her mind. It's a bit tricky. I think the key is that the proposal should be discussed beforehand, not just a surprise. So the author is in the wrong for not discussing it with her first, leading to her unexpected change of mind. Therefore, answer A. But wait, the user might see it as both being at fault, but the options are only A or B. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be B because even if he didn't discuss it first, her reaction of changing her mind after saying yes is worse. So he's not in the wrong. \n\nThis is a tough call, but I think the main point is that both have issues. However, since the options are only A or B, and the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't talk to her first. Or B (No) because she was insensitive. \n\nI've seen similar AITA cases where the proposer was in the wrong for not discussing it first. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: once she said yes, changing her mind is a problem. But she said she wasn't ready. The author's reaction of ending the relationship might be justified if he felt betrayed. \n\nI think the answer is B (No). Because even if he didn't discuss it first, her changing her mind after the proposal is the bigger issue. So he's not the asshole. Therefore, answer B.\n"
