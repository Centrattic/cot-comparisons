      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault in the situation where his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a public proposal.\n\nFirst, the author planned a surprise proposal on a cruise. He set up a photographer and everything, which is a big commitment. She said yes, but later changed her mind. He was devastated, cried, and ended the relationship. She blamed him for moving too quickly and not discussing engagement plans beforehand.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Well, proposing is a big step, and public proposals can be very emotional. The key point here is whether the author was wrong to plan the proposal without discussing it first. She felt they were moving too fast, so maybe he should have talked to her about his intentions before surprising her. However, she did say yes publicly, then retracted it, which is confusing and hurtful. \n\nBut the question is about the author's fault. If he didn't ask her if she was ready for marriage before proposing, that could be his mistake. On the other hand, she might have known her feelings but didn't communicate them clearly. The user ends the relationship because he feels she was insensitive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't check in with her about her readiness for marriage, he might share some responsibility. But she also didn't clarify her feelings before accepting. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that she changed her mind after saying yes, especially in a public setting, adds to the emotional turmoil. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because she didn't communicate her readiness and then changed her mind, leading to the breakup. But there's a nuance where both might have missteps. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he acted on his feelings and she didn't communicate hers, the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
