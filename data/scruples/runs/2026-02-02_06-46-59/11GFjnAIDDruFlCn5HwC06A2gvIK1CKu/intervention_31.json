I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author proposed during a cruise, the girlfriend said yes, but then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt hurt and thought she was insincere. The girlfriend's side is that he moved too quickly without discussing an engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author went ahead and proposed without prior discussion. That's a big step. Proposing is a significant commitment, and not talking about it beforehand could lead to misunderstandings. The girlfriend might have felt blindsided. Even though the author was excited, planning a public proposal without checking in with her first could have been a misstep. She might not have had the chance to express her feelings or readiness.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend said yes and then changed her mind. That's definitely hurtful. Once you say yes to a proposal, it's a serious commitment. Changing your mind after that can leave the other person feeling rejected and confused. However, maybe she realized she wasn't ready after the emotional moment. People can have mixed feelings even after accepting a proposal, especially if they weren't truly ready.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her \"insensitivity.\" But was her change of heart the only issue? The girlfriend's argument is that he moved too fast and didn't communicate. The author could have been more considerate in how he approached the proposal, maybe discussing it first to ensure they were both on the same page. If he didn't talk to her about marriage and just went for the proposal, that could be seen as insensitive as well.\n\nSo, both parties might share some responsibility. The author didn't discuss the proposal, leading to her feeling unprepared. She then accepted but changed her mind, which is also a problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is his failure to communicate, then he might have some fault. But if the focus is on her changing her mind after accepting, she has more responsibility. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether planning the proposal without discussion was inappropriate. That could lead to answer A, but some might argue it's B because the main issue was her backing out. Need to weigh both perspectives.\n"
