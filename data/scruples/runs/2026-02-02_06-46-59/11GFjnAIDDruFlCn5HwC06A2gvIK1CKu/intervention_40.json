I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he proposed during a cruise, she said yes, but later changed her mind. He was really hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. She, on the other hand, said the problem was that he didn't discuss the proposal with her first and that they were moving too quickly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend. That's a big step. In many relationships, proposing is a major decision, and it's usually expected that both partners talk about marriage and their future together before a proposal. If he didn't have that conversation first, she might have felt blindsided, which could explain why she changed her mind later. Her argument that they were moving too quickly makes sense if they hadn't had that serious talk yet.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt that once she said yes, she should have followed through. But maybe she realized after accepting that she wasn't truly ready for marriage. People can have different emotions and pressures in the moment. She might have said yes because of the moment, not because she was genuinely committed. That could explain why she retracted her acceptance later. It's possible she felt pressured or overwhelmed by the public proposal, leading her to make a decision she wasn't comfortable with later.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But was he also insensitive by not discussing the proposal? If he assumed she wanted marriage without confirming, he might have overlooked her needs or feelings. Communication is key in relationships, especially for such a significant decision. By not discussing it beforehand, he might have set himself up for misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's failure to communicate his intentions first makes him at fault. If he had talked to her about marriage and she had expressed hesitation, then proposing might have been premature. Alternatively, if she didn't realize the proposal was coming, her changing her mind could be a result of feeling pressured. Both parties might have some responsibility here. But the key point here is that the author didn't discuss the proposal with her, which could be a significant misstep. Therefore, he might share some of the blame.\n"
