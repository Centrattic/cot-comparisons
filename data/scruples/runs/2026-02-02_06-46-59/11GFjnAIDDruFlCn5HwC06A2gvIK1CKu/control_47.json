      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong after his girlfriend (now ex) took back her \"yes\" to his proposal. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal on a cruise with a photographer and everything. The girlfriend said yes, then later changed her mind. The author felt devastated and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitively leading him on. She, on the other hand, claimed it was his fault for not discussing engagement plans beforehand and moving too quickly.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and expectations. The author assumed that the proposal was a given, but maybe he didn't talk to her about marriage plans before. Proposing in a public way could be seen as pressuring her, especially if they hadn't discussed it. The girlfriend's argument is that they were moving too fast and she wasn't ready. If they hadn't had that conversation, maybe the proposal came as a surprise, which could have been a mistake.\n\nBut then, after she said yes, she retracted it. That's really hurtful. However, maybe she wasn't in a good headspace to make that decision in the moment. Public proposals can be stressful, and sometimes people might say yes due to the circumstances rather than genuine readiness. The author might have made a big assumption by planning the proposal without discussing it first. On the other hand, once she said yes, retracting it later is definitely hurtful and inconsiderate.\n\nSo the question is, who is at fault? The author didn't talk it over, possibly leading to her not being ready. She then didn't follow through after accepting. Both seem to have made mistakes. But the author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, which might be justified given the emotional impact. However, if he didn't check in with her about marriage before, maybe he's also at fault for not ensuring her readiness.\n\nBut the main issue here is that she changed her mind after agreeing. That's a major breach of trust. Even if the proposal was sudden, once she said yes, taking it back is a big deal. However, the fact that she said she wasn't ready and that they were moving too fast suggests that maybe the proposal was premature. So both have points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because while he could have done better in communication, her actions after accepting were more hurtful. But I'm a bit torn. The initial proposal might have been a mistake, but the retraction is worse. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
