I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the one who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal gone wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal on a cruise. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity. She, on the other hand, says the problem was that he didn't discuss the engagement plans with her first and moved too quickly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the public proposal without prior discussion a mistake? Did the girlfriend have the right to change her mind after saying yes? And who is more at fault?\n\nPublic proposals can be a big deal. Some people might see it as a gesture of excitement, but others might feel it's too sudden. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she wasn't ready for the next step, which the author didn't discuss with her beforehand. That could be a point where the author made a mistake. He assumed she was ready without checking in with her, which might have led to her feeling pressured or surprised.\n\nHowever, once she said yes, changing her mind later is also problematic. A yes to a proposal is a significant commitment. If she wasn't ready, maybe she should have communicated that before saying yes. But the author's reaction of ending the relationship because of her insensitivity might be too harsh. The way he ended it could be seen as his own fault if he didn't handle the situation with care.\n\nOn the other hand, if the proposal was indeed a surprise and he didn't have the conversation about their future, that's where the author is at fault. The girlfriend's reason for not wanting to marry him might be valid if they weren't on the same page. But retracting a \"yes\" is confusing and hurtful, so she also shares some responsibility.\n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication from the author. He didn't discuss the engagement with her before proposing, which led to her confusion. But she also changed her mind after accepting, which is hurtful. However, in terms of who's more in the wrong, the author's failure to have that conversation first is a significant mistake. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't check in with her before proposing, leading to the misunderstanding. But if the user's culture or norms consider public proposals as okay, then maybe not. But generally, the expectation is that a proposal involves mutual readiness, and if the author didn't confirm that with her, he did make a mistake.\n"
