We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he proposed on a cruise, she said yes, but then later changed her mind. He was really upset, cried, and ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. She said it was his fault for not discussing engagement first and moving too quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, he went through a public proposal, which is a big commitment. He must have put a lot of thought and emotion into it. When she changed her mind after saying yes, he felt betrayed and heartbroken. Ending the relationship because of that seems like a natural reaction if he felt she was insincere.\n\nOn her side, she claims that the problem was his for not discussing the idea of marriage with her beforehand. Proposing without talking about it could have been a shock, making her feel unprepared. She might have felt pressured, leading her to say yes in the moment but later realizing it wasn't right. Her refusal to listen suggests she felt he didn't take her feelings into account.\n\nNow, looking at societal norms, proposals are usually discussed beforehand. Jumping into a public proposal without prior conversation might be seen as moving too fast. If he didn't talk to her about marriage plans, he might have overlooked her readiness. However, her changing her mind after accepting seems hurtful, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nThe key points are: Did he move too fast without discussion? Yes, that's a common criticism of surprise proposals. Did she handle the rejection poorly? She might have felt unprepared, but retracting her acceptance after the proposal is hurtful. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a shared issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss engagement plans, he shares responsibility. But her changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe the focus is on his lack of prior discussion. But ending the relationship because of her actions might be justified if he felt betrayed. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which led to her feeling unprepared. Even if her actions were hurtful, his approach contributed to the problem. However, this is a nuanced situation where both have some responsibility. But based on the question's structure, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
