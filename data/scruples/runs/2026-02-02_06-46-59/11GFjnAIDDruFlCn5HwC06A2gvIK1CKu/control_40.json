      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise with a big setup, and she initially said yes. Then, after the celebration, she changed her mind and said she didn't want to marry him. He felt heartbroken and ended the relationship, blaming her for leading him on. She, on the other hand, says that the problem was because he planned a public proposal without discussing the engagement first, and that they were moving too quickly for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author argues that she led him on by saying yes and then changing her mind. He felt that she should have communicated her feelings before the proposal instead of letting him get his hopes up. She, however, claims that the issue was his decision to propose publicly without discussing it first, which made her feel pressured and caused her to say yes in the moment but then realized she wasn't ready.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Proposing publicly without prior discussion could be seen as a big move that might pressure the other person. If they hadn't talked about marriage before, the proposal might have come as a surprise, leading to an impulsive \"yes\" followed by a change of heart when the excitement wore off. On the other hand, the author might feel that if she wasn't ready, she should have been honest from the start rather than agreeing in the moment and then backing out.\n\nIt's also important to consider that in a relationship, both partners should have open discussions about major life decisions like marriage. If the author didn't bring up the topic before planning the proposal, that could be a misstep. However, the fact that she changed her mind after saying yes is also a problem, as it can be emotionally damaging to the other person.\n\nSo, who is at fault here? It seems like both could share some responsibility. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her, and she didn't communicate her feelings about moving too quickly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't talk about the proposal with her beforehand, which led to her feeling pressured, maybe he did contribute to the situation. On the flip side, her changing her mind after a commitment is also an issue. But since the question is about the author's fault, the key point is whether his actions (planning a public proposal without discussion) were wrong. That could make him partially at fault. However, the final answer might depend on cultural or societal norms around proposals. In some cases, a public proposal is expected, but if the couple hadn't discussed marriage, it's a big step. So, there's a case for the author being in the wrong (A) because he didn't check in with her before proposing. But also, she should have known her feelings and communicated them. But the question is AITA (Am I the Asshole). The person is asking if they (the author) are the asshole. The user wants to know if the author is wrong. The answer is likely B (No, he's not in the wrong) because while his proposal method might have been hasty, the main issue is her changing her mind after saying yes. However, others might argue that he should have discussed it first. But in the context of AITA, the community often considers the person who made a move without communication as partly at fault. But since the question is about the author's wrongness, and the main issue is her changing her mind, maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. The author is upset because she didn't follow through after a yes. She says it's his fault for moving too quickly. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, maybe he's partly responsible for her feeling pressured. However, the fact that she said yes and then changed her mind is a big deal. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't talk to her about marriage before proposing, leading to her confusion. Or maybe B (No, he's not in the wrong) because her actions were the main problem. I think in AITA scenarios, if one person makes a big commitment without prior discussion, they can be seen as at fault. But the author's perspective is that she led him on. The answer might be B because he ended the relationship due to her insensitivity, but if he didn't communicate, he's also part of the problem. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B. I'm going with B.\n"
