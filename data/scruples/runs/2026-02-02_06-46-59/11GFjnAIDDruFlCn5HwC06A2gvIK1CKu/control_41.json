      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed to his girlfriend during a public cruise event, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He felt broken and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, blamed him for moving too fast without discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: He went through a lot to plan a public proposal, which is a big gesture. When she initially said yes, he was overjoyed. But then she changed her mind, leading to his emotional pain. He felt she led him on and couldn't handle the broken engagement, so he ended the relationship. His reasoning is that she should have communicated her feelings earlier instead of waiting until after the proposal.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: She said yes publicly, which might have been a mistake. She then realized she wasn't ready for marriage, which is a major life decision. She blames the proposal's spontaneity and lack of prior discussion about commitment as the reason she changed her mind. She might feel pressured into a situation she wasn't ready for, hence the proposal was too quick.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and readiness for marriage. Proposing without discussing the engagement beforehand could be seen as moving too fast. The girlfriend might not have had the chance to express her reservations about marriage if the proposal wasn't discussed privately first. On the flip side, the author had a legitimate expectation after she said yes, and her changing her mind could be seen as not being honest about her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the author didn't talk to her about his intention to propose, he might have overlooked her readiness. However, she also didn't clarify her stance after saying yes, which could be seen as insensitivity as well. Both parties could have misstepped here. The author's action of ending the relationship might be justified if he felt betrayed, but the root cause is the lack of communication from both sides.\n\nSo, who is more in the wrong? The author's mistake was not discussing the proposal beforehand, which led to her feeling pressured. However, her changing her mind publicly after saying yes is also a problem. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and expectations around proposals. In some views, a proposal should be discussed before it's made public. Therefore, the author might share some blame for not having that discussion. However, the girlfriend's insensitivity in changing her mind after the public commitment could also be a significant factor.\n\nIn many cases, the expectation is that both partners discuss major life decisions like marriage. If that wasn't done, the author might have moved too fast. However, the girlfriend's reaction of changing her mind after the proposal could be seen as inconsiderate. But since she did express her reservations after the proposal, maybe the author's reaction was too harsh. It's a bit of a grey area, but the key point is the lack of prior communication. If the author didn't discuss the engagement with her first, that's a misstep. So, I might lean towards the author being partly at fault, but not entirely. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B (No), because she changed her mind after the proposal, which is her prerogative, but the author's lack of prior discussion is a problem. However, in this context, the main issue is the girlfriend's change of heart, so the author might not be the one in the wrong. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't discuss the proposal, that's a problem. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also a problem. The answer might be B (No) because she changed her mind, but the author's actions could be seen as valid given her insensitivity. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because he didn't discuss it first. It's tricky. I think the consensus here would be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe shares some blame. However, the answer options are A or B. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No), because the girlfriend's actions were more damaging by changing her mind after the proposal, but the author's approach was flawed. However, the question is from the author's perspective, asking if he's in the wrong. The answer is B because the main issue is the girlfriend's insensitivity in changing her mind, even though the author could have been more communicative. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
