      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He was hurt and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. The proposal was planned with a photographer, which sounds public. The girlfriend then said yes but later didn't want to go through with the marriage. The author is upset because she changed her mind, while she claims it was his fault for moving too fast without discussing engagement first.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. Let me consider both sides. The author might be in the wrong if he didn't communicate properly. Proposing without discussing the idea of marriage beforehand could be a problem. If they hadn't talked about their readiness for marriage, the proposal might have been premature. On the other hand, once she said yes, retracting it after the proposal seems hurtful and maybe insincere. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend said she wasn't ready and they were moving too quickly. If the author hadn't discussed engagement plans before the proposal, that's a valid point. However, once she agreed, changing her mind could be seen as inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author should have had that conversation before the proposal.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't talk about future plans, including marriage, and then sprung a proposal, he might be at fault. The girlfriend might have felt pressured. However, after accepting, she retracted, which is also hurtful. \n\nBut the question is about who is in the wrong. The author ended the relationship because she was insensitive. The girlfriend ended the engagement after accepting. So, the author is breaking up over her changing her mind, which might be his choice. However, if he didn't give her a chance to explain initially (as he says he asked why she led him on and she got upset), maybe they could have resolved it. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong to propose without discussing engagement first. If he did that, he could be at fault. Alternatively, she could be wrong for changing her mind after accepting. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I need to decide based on the information. The author's reasoning was that she should have told him earlier instead of changing her mind after. The girlfriend's reasoning was that the proposal was premature. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author should have talked about marriage plans before the proposal. If they hadn't discussed it, the proposal might have been a surprise that she wasn't ready for. So the author's actions led to the situation. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not communicating his intentions beforehand. The girlfriend's response, while hurtful, was based on the proposal happening without prior discussion. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't discuss engagement plans first, leading to the miscommunication.\n"
