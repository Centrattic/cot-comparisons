I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that was accepted but then withdrawn. The author proposed publicly, and the partner changed her mind afterward. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author planned a public proposal without prior discussion. Maybe that was a big step without checking if she was ready. The partner said they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. She might feel pressured or unprepared. The author was hurt and ended the relationship, which is his choice, but does that mean he's in the wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the partner changed her mind, which can be hard. But the public proposal might have added pressure. Maybe he should have discussed the engagement more before proposing. However, she did say yes initially, which could be a point in his favor. But then she retracted it, leading to his emotional pain. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user's reasoning might be that the partner changed her mind, and the author could have handled it differently. But the author felt she was insensitively leading him on. \n\nI need to decide if the author's actions were wrong. The key points are the public proposal without discussion and the immediate breakup. If the author should have talked about the proposal first, then he might be at fault. But if the partner wasn't ready, then maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the author's reaction is valid because he was hurt. Ending the relationship is his choice. But whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his actions were reasonable. The public proposal might have been a mistake, but the partner's retraction is also a valid response. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He tried to propose, she accepted but then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship due to hurt and feeling led on. While the proposal could have been discussed more, the main issue is the partner's change of heart. The author's decision to end the relationship is his choice, not necessarily wrong.\n"
