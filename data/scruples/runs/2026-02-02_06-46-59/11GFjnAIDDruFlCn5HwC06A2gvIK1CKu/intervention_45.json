      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person proposed to their girlfriend on a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. But later, she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. The proposer ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitively leading him on. The question is whether the proposer is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer planned a public proposal, which is a big step. He might not have discussed it with her first, which she brought up as a problem. She claims they were moving too quickly, which is a common issue in relationships. She said yes in the moment but later changed her mind, which is understandable but painful. The proposer felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nOn one hand, the proposer didn't check in with her about their future before proposing, which is a significant decision. Proposing without discussing engagement could leave room for misunderstanding. If they hadn't talked about marriage, she might not have realized the proposal was imminent. So, maybe the proposer rushed things without the necessary conversation.\n\nOn the other hand, the proposer was excited and set up a proposal, expecting a commitment. When she changed her mind, he felt hurt and ended the relationship. Her changing her mind after saying yes is confusing and hurtful. However, people can have moments of panic or realization after a big decision, especially if they weren't fully prepared.\n\nThe key points are whether the proposer should have discussed the proposal first and whether the woman's reaction was justified. The proposer claims she led him on, but she says they were moving too fast. If they hadn't had those discussions, then maybe both share some responsibility. The proposer might have acted without ensuring mutual readiness, but the woman also changed her mind after accepting, which is tough.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the proposer might be in the wrong for not having the conversation first. Proposing is a major commitment, and it's important to ensure both parties are on the same page. The woman was honest in the end, even if it was painful, while the proposer might have skipped steps. So, maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
