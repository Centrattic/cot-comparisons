      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the scenario is that the author proposed on a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. Then later, she changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the proposal was public and planned, which the author did without discussing the engagement first. The girlfriend felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. She changed her mind after the initial yes. The author ended the relationship immediately, feeling she was insensitive.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. From what I know about relationships, proposing is a big step. Normally, couples discuss the future before a proposal. The author didn't talk about engagement first, which the girlfriend mentioned as her reason for changing her mind. That suggests the author might have rushed into the proposal without ensuring both were on the same page about marriage.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend said yes initially, then took it back. That's confusing. She might have realized the proposal was too sudden. However, after accepting, changing her mind could be seen as insensitivity because the author was expecting a commitment. But the author also didn't check if she was ready, so maybe both parties have some responsibility.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction: she said it was the author's fault for not discussing engagement first. The author's response was to end the relationship immediately. Ending a relationship right after such a shock could be impulsive, but given the hurt, maybe understandable.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: the author didn't ask if she was ready first, leading to a rushed proposal. The girlfriend changed her mind after accepting, which is confusing and hurtful. Both have some fault here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author's approach might have been abrupt, not discussing engagement first. However, the girlfriend did say yes, then changed her mind. The author ended the relationship for her insensitivity, but maybe he should have given her a chance to explain or discussed it further before ending things. However, the immediate end might be a reaction to the hurt, which is valid.\n\nSo, the answer might be a mix. But according to the options, it's AITA (Am I the Asshole). The options are A for Yes (author is wrong) or B for No (not wrong). In many AITA scenarios, if someone changes their mind after a commitment, that's often seen as the person being the asshole. However, the setup here (author not discussing engagement) might also be a factor.\n\nI think the girlfriend is more in the wrong here because after saying yes, changing her mind without a valid reason is hurtful. However, the author also didn't check if she was ready, so maybe some fault on both sides. But the question is specifically about the author's fault. Since the author ended the relationship because she was insensitive, but the initial proposal might have been a mistake. However, the key point is that she took back her yes, which is hurtful. The answer might be B (No, the author isn't wrong) because the girlfriend's actions were more harmful. Alternatively, the author is in the wrong for not discussing engagement first. Hmm. It's tricky. I think in AITA terms, the person who broke off the engagement after saying yes is often seen as the asshole. But the setup here might be that the author rushed the proposal. So maybe the answer is B because the author isn't wrong, but the girlfriend is. Or maybe A. I need to decide based on common sense. If someone says \"yes\" and then takes it back, that's the asshole move. So the girlfriend is the asshole, so the author isn't wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
