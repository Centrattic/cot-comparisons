      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a proposal that turned into a breakup. The author proposed on a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. But then she changed her mind later, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt betrayed because she changed her mind after accepting. He was upset and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. She, on the other hand, felt the proposal was rushed, that he didn't discuss the engagement with her first, and that they were moving too quickly. She might not have realized how committed she was until after saying yes.\n\nThe author's main point is that she changed her mind, which hurt him. He didn't agree with her reasoning about moving too fast. She might have felt pressured by the public proposal without prior discussion. Proposing in a public manner can be overwhelming and might not give the other person enough time to process their feelings without pressure.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to check. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe he did make the proposal without discussing it first, which could have led to her feeling unprepared. However, once she said yes, walking away after the fact is hurtful. But she might have realized her feelings changed after the proposal. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author could have discussed the engagement more before the proposal, but once she accepted, retracting her answer is also a problem. However, she might not have been emotionally ready, and the public proposal might have pressured her. The author ended the relationship because he felt hurt and didn't see her reasoning. \n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault, but there's some shared responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key point is that she retracted her acceptance. If she truly wasn't ready, maybe she should have been more honest before the proposal. But the author might have rushed things. \n\nI think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he ended the relationship over a betrayal of trust, which is valid. However, if he didn't consider her readiness beforehand, maybe there's some fault. But the main issue is her changing her mind after saying yes. So, the answer might be B.\n"
