      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal on a cruise. The guy planned a public proposal with a photographer, she said yes, but then changed her mind later. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man set up a public proposal without discussing it first. She initially said yes, then changed her mind. He argues she should have been honest earlier, while she claims he moved too fast without discussing engagement.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be wrong but is unsure. So, the question is whether the man is at fault. \n\nPublic proposals can be seen as a romantic gesture, but they can also be overwhelming if not discussed beforehand. The man didn't check in with her about the proposal plans, which could have been a miscommunication. However, once she said yes, she later changed her mind. That's a big shift. \n\nThe woman's response is that moving too quickly led to the problem. The man ended the relationship because he felt betrayed. But if she genuinely wasn't ready, maybe the problem is the lack of prior discussion. On the other hand, after accepting the proposal, she retracted it, which could be seen as leading him on. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about his intentions before planning the proposal, that's a flaw. But if she changed her mind after saying yes, that's also a problem. The man's anger might be justified if he felt she wasn't truthful. However, breaking up over this might be a reaction to the hurt, not necessarily the right decision. \n\nI think both sides have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. If the main issue was not discussing the proposal plans, he's at fault. But if she changed her mind after committing, she's at fault. The answer depends on whose actions were more hurtful. Since she retracted her consent after the proposal, maybe she's more at fault. But the man's public proposal without discussion could be seen as insensitive too. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, so maybe leaning towards A. Wait, but in the original question, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the situation. \n\nAlternatively, the man's reaction of ending the relationship might be too harsh if she was trying to communicate her feelings. However, her retracting the \"yes\" after the proposal is a bigger betrayal. So perhaps the woman is more at fault, making the author not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
