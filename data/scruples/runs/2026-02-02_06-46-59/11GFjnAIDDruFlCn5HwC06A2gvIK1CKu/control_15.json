I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal, and the girlfriend said yes initially but then changed her mind. The girl says it was the guy's fault for not discussing engagement first and moving too fast. The guy ended it because he felt led on.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy planned a proposal without prior discussion. Maybe he assumed she was ready, but proposing without talking about the future might be a misstep. On the other hand, the girl said yes and then changed her mind, which is hurtful. She also didn't communicate her feelings before the proposal. The guy ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe he contributed by not discussing engagement first.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The girl's actions were cruel after saying yes, but the guy did plan a proposal without checking her readiness. Both could be seen as having some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The girl's refusal to listen and her initial betrayal might mean she's more at fault. But the guy's approach might have been too abrupt. The key points are communication and mutual readiness. The guy might not be entirely in the wrong here because proposing without discussing is a mistake, but the girl's actions were worse. However, if the guy didn't consider her readiness, maybe he shares some fault. But since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), as the main responsibility is on her for changing her mind after accepting.\n"
