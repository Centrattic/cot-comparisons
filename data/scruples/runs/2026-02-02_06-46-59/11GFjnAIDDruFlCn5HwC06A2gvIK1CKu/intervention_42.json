I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, got a \"yes,\" but then the girl changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The guy put a lot into the proposal, maybe didn't discuss it with her first, which could be an issue. She said yes but then changed her mind, which is really hurtful. The key points here are whether the guy was wrong to propose without discussing it first, and whether the girl was wrong for changing her answer.\n\nThe girl's perspective is that he moved too quickly and that the public proposal without prior discussion made her feel pressured. She might not have been ready for marriage, and the public setting added pressure. On the other hand, the guy was hurt because she led him on, saying yes and then backing out. He ended the relationship because he couldn't handle that.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the guy didn't talk to her about marriage before planning the proposal, that's a big problem. Proposing in a public setting without knowing her feelings for sure could be seen as impulsive. The girl might have felt that the proposal was too sudden and that he didn't give her a chance to express her true feelings. So, maybe the guy did move too quickly, which is his fault.\n\nBut then, she agreed to the proposal, celebrated, and then changed her mind. That's also a big issue. Once she said yes, even if she was unsure, retracting it without a good reason could hurt him deeply. He had every right to be devastated. So she's also in the wrong for leading him on.\n\nThe question is who is more at fault. The user thinks the author (the guy) is in the wrong. But I need to consider if he did something wrong. If he didn't discuss the engagement plans with her first, that's his mistake. But if he had discussed it, maybe she would have said no. So maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, proposing in a public way without prior communication is a big red flag. So he might be partly at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, her changing her answer after saying yes is a huge betrayal. Both could be wrong. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is wrong. But maybe the answer is that both are wrong. However, according to the options, it's either A or B. Since the question is about the author (the guy), if he's the one who is wrong, then A. If not, B.\n\nBut given that the guy didn't discuss the proposal first, that's a mistake. However, the girl's action of retracted her yes is also a problem. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So if the guy is not in the wrong, then B. But if he did something wrong by proposing without discussing, then A. It's a tricky call. The user thinks A. But maybe the right answer is A because he didn't check in with her first. However, the girl's action is worse. But the question is about the author's wrongness. Maybe the answer is A because he didn't have proper communication before the proposal. So the answer would be A.\n"
