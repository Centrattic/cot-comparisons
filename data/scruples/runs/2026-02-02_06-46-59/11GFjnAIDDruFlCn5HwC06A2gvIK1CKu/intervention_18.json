I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed during a cruise setup, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. She felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. She said yes initially but then changed her mind. He was hurt and ended the relationship. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he put a lot of effort into the proposal, and she didn't seem to have discussed her feelings about marriage with him. He might feel betrayed when she said yes and then changed her mind. But from her side, she might have been pressured into a public proposal and didn't feel ready. She could be scared or unsure, and maybe the public proposal made her feel cornered.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, suggesting that maybe the author should have discussed marriage plans first. So, if the author didn't talk about marriage before the proposal, that could be a mistake. However, the author might argue that she gave him a \"yes\" during the proposal, so he had a right to feel hurt when she changed her mind. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. If he wanted to propose, he should have discussed it with her first to understand her feelings. The fact that she said yes in the moment but wasn't ready for marriage might indicate that she wasn't fully committed. However, he could also be at fault for not having that conversation beforehand. \n\nOn the other hand, she changed her mind after saying yes, which can be really painful. But maybe she was honest in the end. The author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe he should have been more understanding. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the proposal plans first. She had the right to change her mind, but he could have handled it better. However, she also should have communicated her feelings about marriage earlier. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't discuss it first, leading to the situation. But maybe it's a shared fault. But the options are only A or B. Since the user thinks A, but I need to decide. I think A because the author didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which is a crucial step.\n"
