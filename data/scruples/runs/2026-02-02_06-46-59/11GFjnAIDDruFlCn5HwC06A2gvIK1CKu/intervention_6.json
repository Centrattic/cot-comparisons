      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He felt broken, cried, ended the relationship, and is now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, proposing is a big deal. The author went through a lot of effort to plan a public proposal without discussing it with her first. The girlfriend might feel that he moved too quickly, especially if they weren't discussing marriage yet. She might have said yes in the moment because of the emotional pressure or the situation, not because she was truly ready. Her explanation is that he didn't talk to her about engagement before planning it, which could be a valid point. If they hadn't discussed marriage, a surprise proposal might have been unexpected and overwhelming.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might think that after she said yes, even if she wasn't fully ready, she should have been honest. He felt she led him on, which is a common argument in situations like this. But maybe she was scared or unsure in the moment and didn't want to hurt his feelings immediately. The question is whether the author's actions were insensitive by not discussing the proposal first, or if the girlfriend's change of heart was insensitivity.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. That's because maybe the author didn't communicate his intentions, which is important in a relationship. Proposing without talking about marriage could be seen as jumping the gun. However, the girlfriend also didn't stay with her decision, which can be hurtful. But the key point here is whether the author's approach was wrong. If the girlfriend felt pressured or caught off guard, then the author might have been too hasty. Ending the relationship over her change of heart might be seen as harsh, but if he felt betrayed by her not being honest, then maybe he's justified.\n\nSo, breaking it down: Did the author do something wrong by proposing without discussing it first? If the relationship wasn't discussing marriage yet, a surprise proposal could be moving too fast. That would put some responsibility on him. The girlfriend's reaction of saying yes and then changing her mind is also problematic, but her reason for feeling unready might be valid. The author ending the relationship because of her insensitivity might be his way of dealing with the betrayal he feels, but if he's the one who didn't communicate, maybe he's not entirely in the right.\n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he didn't discuss the proposal with his girlfriend first, which could have led to her feeling pressured. Proposals should ideally be discussed beforehand to ensure both parties are ready. The girlfriend's change of heart is hurtful, but the initial action of the author might have contributed to the problem.\n"
