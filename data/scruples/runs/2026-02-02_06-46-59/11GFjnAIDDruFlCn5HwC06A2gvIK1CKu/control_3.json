I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who proposed (the author) is in the wrong after his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a public proposal. \n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. The girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind, saying she wasn't ready. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The author didn't discuss the proposal with his girlfriend beforehand. A big decision like marriage should ideally be discussed before the proposal, especially in a public setting. Proposing without prior conversation could be seen as rushing into a major commitment without ensuring both partners are on the same page.\n\n2. The girlfriend felt the relationship was moving too quickly and wasn't ready for marriage. She might have felt pressured or that the proposal was impulsive. Her change of heart could be because she wasn't prepared for the next step, which the author didn't address before the proposal.\n\n3. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive for not being honest earlier. But maybe he should have considered that she might not have realized the proposal was coming, or that she didn't have the chance to express her feelings before the public commitment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. While the girlfriend's actions are hurtful, the author's decision to propose without discussing it first might have contributed to the problem. By not talking about their future together first, he might have put pressure on her, leading to her mixed signals. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key, especially for major decisions. The author's assumption that she was ready without having that conversation could be a misstep. So, while the girlfriend's response was hurtful, the author might share some responsibility for not ensuring they were aligned on marriage before proposing.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), as he didn't communicate his intentions first, leading to the situation where the girlfriend felt pressured and then had to retract her acceptance.\n"
