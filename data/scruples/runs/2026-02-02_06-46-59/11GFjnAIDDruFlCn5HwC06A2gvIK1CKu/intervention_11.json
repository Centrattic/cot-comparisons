      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a public proposal. The user themselves think the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author planned a public proposal on a cruise. He set up a photographer and everything. She said yes, they celebrated, but later she changed her mind. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's actions: planning a public proposal without discussing it with her first. Public proposals can be a big deal, and maybe he assumed she was ready for that step. But maybe he didn't talk to her about the engagement process beforehand. She said they were moving too quickly, which suggests she didn't feel ready for marriage, even though she said yes in the moment.\n\nHer response: she took back her acceptance. That's really hurtful. Saying yes in a public setting and then reversing it later can be devastating. But she claims the author didn't give her a chance to discuss the engagement. So, maybe there's some mutual responsibility here.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. He took her \"yes\" back, leading to emotional pain, but she had her own reasons. However, the author ended the relationship, citing her insensitivity. But was it his fault for not discussing the proposal with her first?\n\nPublic proposals can be traditional, but some people might feel pressured into saying yes in that moment. She might have been influenced by the circumstances rather than her true feelings. If he didn't talk to her about the engagement steps, maybe he set up a scenario where she felt she had to say yes on the spot, which led to her later regret.\n\nOn the other hand, once she said yes, retracting it is a major betrayal. But she had her reasons. It's a bit of a complex situation. The author's argument is that she led him on, but her argument is that he moved too fast. \n\nI think the key point here is whether the author should have discussed the proposal with her beforehand. If he didn't have that conversation, he might have misread her readiness, leading to her confusion. So, he might share some responsibility for not checking in with her about the engagement process. However, her taking back her answer after celebrating was definitely hurtful and inconsiderate. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If we consider that he didn't communicate his intentions and she felt pressured, then he might be partially at fault. However, if we look at her actions of retracting the yes as the main issue, then she's the one at fault. But the question is about the author's wrongness. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the immediate issue is her retracting the consent after he had trusted her, which is a huge emotional hit. However, the root cause might have deeper issues where both sides contributed, but in terms of the specific act of breaking the engagement, she took back her yes, which is the main problem here. The author might have made a mistake in the proposal setup, but the direct fault is hers for changing her mind after giving consent.\n"
