      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer, and she initially said yes. They celebrated with champagne and pictures, but later she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitively leading him on. The girlfriend's argument is that the author rushed things by planning a public proposal without discussing the engagement first, and she wasn't ready. The author ended the relationship, and now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author probably had high hopes and put a lot into planning the proposal. A public proposal can be a big step, and maybe he expected her to be ready for marriage. But the girlfriend says she wasn't ready and that he moved too fast. She might feel pressured by the public proposal without prior discussion. \n\nThe key points here are communication and readiness. The author didn't discuss the engagement with her first, which might have made her feel ambushed. Even if she said yes initially, changing her mind later shows that maybe she wasn't truly committed at the time. However, the author's reaction of ending the relationship might be seen as harsh if she was honest about her feelings later. But he felt she was insensitively leading him on, which he can't overlook. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to have open communication about major life decisions like marriage. If the author didn't have that conversation beforehand, he might have contributed to the problem. On the other hand, if she changed her mind after saying yes, that's also a serious issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's refusal to listen when he expressed his feelings about her actions might indicate a lack of empathy. However, the author's decision to end the relationship is his choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on if he acted responsibly. Since he didn't discuss the proposal first, he might share some responsibility for not ensuring she was ready. But she also changed her mind after the proposal, which is her decision. \n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but the girlfriend's actions also contributed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fact that he didn't discuss the proposal first could be his fault, but the girlfriend's subsequent change of heart is her own responsibility. The answer might be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong, but there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the main issue is that he didn't have a prior conversation, then he might share some blame. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
