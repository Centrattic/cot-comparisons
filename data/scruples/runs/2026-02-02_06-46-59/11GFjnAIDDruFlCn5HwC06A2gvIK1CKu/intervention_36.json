      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went sideways.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes during the proposal but then changed her mind later. He's upset and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. She, on the other hand, felt he moved too quickly without discussing the engagement first.\n\nSo the main points of contention here are: Did the author make a mistake by not talking about the proposal beforehand? And was she justified in withdrawing her acceptance?\n\nIn many relationships, major decisions like marriage are typically discussed before a formal proposal. Proposing without prior discussion might come off as impulsive. However, public proposals can be a romantic gesture for some people. The key issue here is that the author didn't check in with her about their readiness for marriage before proposing, which led to her feeling pressured. \n\nShe agreed during the proposal but later realized it wasn't what she wanted. That's a tricky situation. When someone says \"yes\" during a proposal, it's usually a commitment, but maybe she was overwhelmed or not fully prepared in that moment. However, retracting a \"yes\" after the proposal can be hurtful, as the proposer might feel betrayed or disrespected.\n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But he might be in the wrong if he didn't consider her perspective. Maybe she felt blindsided by the proposal, which led her to change her mind later. On the flip side, if she knew she wasn't ready, she should have communicated that during the proposal instead of accepting.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether not discussing the proposal first was a mistake. In long-term relationships, communication is key. Assuming that the other person is on the same page without discussing it can lead to misunderstandings. The author didn't set up the conversation about marriage, which might have contributed to her confusion or feeling unprepared.\n\nHowever, the woman's withdrawal of her \"yes\" after the proposal is also problematic. Once someone accepts a proposal, it's expected that they follow through. If she wasn't certain, she should have expressed that before saying \"yes.\"\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't discuss the proposal first, which was a misstep. But she also didn't communicate her hesitation properly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't check in with her about their readiness, he shares some responsibility. But ending the relationship because she changed her mind is a strong reaction, but maybe justified if he felt betrayed. \n\nOverall, the author made a mistake by not discussing the proposal first, which could have prevented the situation. Therefore, he might be at fault. But she also had a role in not being honest during the proposal. The answer depends on whether the author's actions were the primary cause. Given the question is about the author's fault, the answer is A.\n"
