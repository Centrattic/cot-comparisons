      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a proposal that went sour. The guy (the author) proposed on a cruise with a setup, and she said yes, but then quickly changed her mind. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. The question is whether he's in the wrong or not.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. He set up a photographer and all that. She agreed to marry him but then backed out. He feels she led him on. But she says he moved too fast without talking about engagement first. \n\nSo, the key points here. Proposing is a big step, and maybe he didn't have that conversation beforehand. She might not have been ready for that commitment. If they hadn't discussed getting engaged, then maybe the proposal came as a surprise. However, the way he set it up as a public event might have put pressure on her. She said yes in the moment but later realized she wasn't ready. \n\nBut then there's the question of insensitivity. He was hurt, which is understandable. She didn't want to marry him after saying yes, which is also a big deal. But he ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. Is he right to end it that way? \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both sides have some responsibility. The author didn't check if she was ready for a proposal, and she didn't communicate her feelings. However, the act of changing her mind after saying yes is a major issue. But perhaps the root problem was not discussing the engagement before the proposal. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, according to the information given, the girl said yes but then changed her mind. The author feels she led him on. The girl's argument is that he moved too fast. In some cultures, a proposal is a big step, but if they hadn't discussed it, maybe he was too abrupt. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for proposing without discussing it first? That could be a point. But the girl is also wrong for not being honest about her feelings. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the answer is A (author is wrong), then maybe because he didn't have that conversation first. If B (not wrong), then because she was insincere. \n\nIt's a tough call. The girl said yes but changed her mind, which is hurtful. But the author didn't talk to her about proposing first. Both have some fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B because the girl's actions were the problem, but the setup could be his fault. \n\nBut in the context of the story, the author feels he's not in the wrong because she was insensitive. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The girl is the one who changed her mind without considering his feelings. However, the fact that he set it up without discussing might be his fault. But the main issue is her backing out after saying yes. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because the girl's insensitivity was the main issue, even if he didn't discuss the proposal beforehand. But maybe the answer is A if the setup was his fault. It's a bit of a toss-up. But in typical AITA scenarios, if someone proposes without discussing it, that's often seen as moving too fast. But the girl's reaction is also a problem. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B. The girl is the one who changed her mind after saying yes, which is the bigger issue here. The author's mistake was maybe the setup, but the main fault is on her for leading him on. So the author is not in the wrong, answer B.\n"
