I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment.

She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a proposal gone wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, she said yes but then changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy put a lot into the proposal, maybe didn't discuss it beforehand. She agreed publicly but then backed out. That's tough, but maybe she had reasons. The question is about fault. \n\nThe girl says the fault is his for not discussing engagement first. Proposing without talking about it might have been a mistake. He might have assumed she wanted to get married, but maybe they weren't on the same page. \n\nShe changed her mind after saying yes. That's a big deal. The guy was hurt, and she didn't want to engage. But why didn't she tell him before the proposal? Wait, she said they were moving too quickly. Maybe she didn't realize the proposal was happening, but if he didn't discuss it, she might not have had a chance to say no. \n\nThe guy ended the relationship because of her \"insensitivity.\" Is that fair? He was hurt, but breaking up immediately after might be a reaction. However, she did lead him on publicly. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The guy didn't talk to her about proposing first. Maybe he should have discussed their future plans before the proposal. She didn't communicate her feelings about moving too fast, but she changed her mind after saying yes. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both might be at fault. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The guy's actions (proposing without discussion) led to the situation. She changed her mind, which is also her fault. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural or social norms. In some views, the man's right to propose without prior discussion might be accepted, but in others, it's important to discuss such a major step. \n\nThe girl's reaction of saying yes and then backing out is definitely hurtful. However, if the man didn't talk to her about the proposal first, he might have contributed to the problem. \n\nSo, the answer could be that both have some fault. But the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then the author is wrong for not discussing the proposal first. If B (no), then the girl is wrong for changing her mind. \n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, the consensus often is that the person who proposed without discussing it is at fault to some degree. The girl's actions are also wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So maybe answer A. But the user might expect B. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author ended the relationship because of the girl's insensitivity. The girl said yes and then changed her mind. The author's mistake was not discussing the proposal first, leading to the misunderstanding. So yes, he's in the wrong for not having that conversation. Therefore, A. But maybe the answer is B because the girl's actions are worse. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because proposing is a common gesture, and he had the right to do so if he thought she was ready. The girl's fault is leading him on. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think both have faults, but the question is about the author. The answer depends on perspective. In many cases, the public proposal without prior discussion is seen as a mistake, making the author in the wrong. So answer A. But if the girl's actions are worse, then B. \n\nI'm leaning towards A because the author didn't discuss the proposal, which led to the problem. So the answer is A.\n"
