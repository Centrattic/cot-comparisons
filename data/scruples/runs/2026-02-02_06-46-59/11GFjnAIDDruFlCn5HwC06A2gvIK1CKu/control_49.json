      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and she said yes. They celebrated with champagne and photos, but later she changed her mind and didn't want to actually marry him. The author was heartbroken and ended the relationship, saying he can't overlook her insensitivity. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the author's actions. Proposing is a major step, and doing it publicly without discussing it with his partner first might be an issue. The woman says it was his fault for moving too quickly and not discussing engagement first. She felt pressured, maybe, and wasn't ready. So, was the public proposal a mistake? If they hadn't talked about marriage before, planning a surprise proposal might have been presumptuous. That could be his fault. She was insistent that she wasn't ready, but she said yes in front of others. The author felt led on, which is understandable. The woman might have been insincere, but she might have been overwhelmed in the moment. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive, but maybe he also contributed by not having that conversation first. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't consult her before proposing, which could be seen as dismissive of her readiness. However, she did say yes, which complicates things. The answer might be that the author is somewhat at fault for not discussing the proposal first, making him share the blame. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't check in with her first. But also, her changing her mind might be a problem. But the question is about the author's wrongness. So, A or B? I think A because he didn't communicate before the proposal, which led to her feeling pressured. So the answer is A.\n"
