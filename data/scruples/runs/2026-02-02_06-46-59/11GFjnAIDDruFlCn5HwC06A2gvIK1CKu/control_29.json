      "text": "Okay, let's break down this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal that went wrong. The author proposed during a cruise with a public setup, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a surprise proposal, which might not have been the best approach. Proposing without discussing it beforehand could be seen as moving too quickly. However, the girlfriend initially said yes and then changed her mind. That's a big deal because a proposal is a significant step, and retracting a \"yes\" can be very hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning was that the author didn't discuss the engagement plans with her first. That could mean she felt blindsided, which is a valid concern. People might argue that proposing without prior discussion shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and readiness. On the other hand, after saying yes, changing her mind might have been the more hurtful action. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. That's a personal choice, but it's important to see if he had any fault in the situation. If he proposed without discussing it, he might have contributed to the problem. However, her retracting the \"yes\" after the proposal is a major issue. \n\nIn terms of societal perspectives, there's often criticism of surprise proposals because they don't involve mutual discussion. The girlfriend might not have been ready, and the author's approach may have pressured her. But the act of retracting a commitment after the proposal is also problematic. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? He did propose without discussing it, which could be seen as moving too quickly. But the girl's actions of changing her mind after saying yes are also a big issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he proposed without prior discussion, he might share some responsibility. But the main fault could be on her for changing her mind after the proposal. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't discuss the proposal first, he might be at fault for not considering her perspective. But the girl's actions after saying yes are also significant. However, the author ended the relationship, which could be a reaction to her insensitivity. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nIn many similar situations, the person who proposed without prior discussion is often seen as having some responsibility. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't discuss the proposal first, leading to her feeling unready. However, her retracting the \"yes\" is also a big issue. But the question is about who is more in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if both are. \n\nGiven that, if the main issue is the author's approach, then he might be in the wrong. But if the main issue is her changing her mind, then she is. However, the author's action of proposing without discussion is a key factor. So maybe the answer is A. Alternatively, the answer could be B if the main fault lies with the girlfriend. \n\nBut considering that the author proposed without discussing it first, which is a common criticism, he might share responsibility. Therefore, the answer could be A. However, the girlfriend's actions after saying yes are also significant. It's a bit of a balance. In many cases, people might say that the author didn't consider her readiness and moved too fast, making him at fault. So answer A.\n"
