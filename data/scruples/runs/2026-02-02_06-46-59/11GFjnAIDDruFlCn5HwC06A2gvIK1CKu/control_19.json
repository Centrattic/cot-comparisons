      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" during a proposal. So, the context is that he planned a big proposal on a cruise, with a photographer and everything. She said yes, they celebrated with champagne and pictures, but then later she changed her mind, saying she wasn't ready and that he moved too fast. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The proposer's perspective: he went through a lot to plan this proposal, expecting a committed engagement. When she changed her mind, he felt betrayed because she didn't communicate her feelings beforehand. She said it was his fault for not discussing the engagement first. He ended it because he couldn't handle the emotional hurt.\n\nFrom her perspective, she might have felt pressured or surprised by the sudden proposal. Maybe she wasn't ready for marriage and didn't want to give a false \"yes\" but then had second thoughts. She might have thought a public proposal was too rushed for their relationship's pace.\n\nBut he did plan a public proposal without discussing it first. That could be seen as taking initiative without considering her readiness. However, once she said yes, changing it later is also hurtful. The key points are communication and mutual readiness. If they didn't talk about marriage before, he might have made an assumption. Her changing her mind after the proposal is also problematic, but maybe her reason was valid if they weren't discussing the future enough.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the proposal was a surprise without prior discussion and if her change of heart was justified. Since he didn't discuss the engagement before proposing, that could be a misstep. But her taking back her \"yes\" is also a major issue. However, the user ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. But is that his fault for not checking in with her first?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't talk to her about marriage before the proposal, he might have assumed she was ready. Her reaction suggests she wasn't prepared to commit, which is valid if they weren't on the same page. However, retracting a \"yes\" after celebrating it is extremely hurtful. But the fault isn't entirely on one side. However, according to the user's perspective, he ended it because of her insensitivity, but maybe he should have had that conversation earlier. Alternatively, her actions were hurtful regardless. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes, he's wrong), then that implies he shouldn't have proposed without discussing first. If B (No), then he isn't wrong because her actions led to the breakup. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the proposal was a surprise without prior discussion, which could be seen as his fault. But her changing her mind afterward is also a problem. However, since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might be A because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to misunderstanding. But maybe not entirely. Alternatively, she's in more wrong for taking back her commitment. \n\nBut according to the AITA standard, the one who is more at fault is the one who caused the hurt. If the proposal was a surprise, he might have misread her readiness. But once she said yes and then changed her mind, that's a big issue. However, the user is asking if he's wrong. The answer might be B (No) because he had the right to propose, and her retracting the commitment is the problem. But some people might argue he should have discussed it first. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think in AITA comments, often if someone proposes without prior discussion and the other person isn't ready, the proposer is seen as partially at fault. But the user ended it because of her insensitivity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the main issue was her changing her mind after the proposal, not the proposal itself. However, if he didn't discuss it first, maybe that's a factor. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer is likely B.\n"
