We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, set up with a photographer, and she said yes but later changed her mind. He felt led on and broke up with her, thinking she was insensitive. She said it was his fault for not discussing the proposal first and moving too quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's actions: planning a public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. That's a big step, and it's usually considered important to talk about such a significant decision before making a public commitment. She might have felt surprised and unprepared. On the other hand, she did say yes publicly, then changed her mind. That could be seen as insincere or leading him on, but maybe she was overwhelmed in that moment.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider cultural norms and relationship expectations. Proposing without discussing it first could be a misstep because it's a major life decision. However, once she said yes, even if she later changed her mind, that's a different issue. But the fact that she changed her mind after the proposal might be a problem in itself.\n\nAlso, the breakup was initiated by the author because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. Was her change of heart insensitivity or was it a case of her realizing she wasn't ready? The key point here is whether the author's actions contributed to the problem. By not discussing the proposal first, he might have pressured her, leading to her agreeing in the moment but later reconsidering. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not having the conversation earlier.\n\nAlternatively, once she said yes, changing her mind could be seen as breaking the commitment. But in some cases, people might say yes in the heat of the moment and later realize they aren't ready. The question is about who is more in the wrong. The author's approach might have been too sudden, but her retracting the acceptance is also problematic.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions (sudden proposal) led to her not being able to think clearly. But her changing her mind after accepting is also an issue. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the common advice is to discuss marriage before proposing, the author might have made a mistake in not having that conversation first. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong), but maybe not entirely. However, the options are A or B, and the user is leaning towards A. I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
