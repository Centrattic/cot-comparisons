I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that the girlfriend said yes to but then changed her mind. The man set up a big public proposal, and she later said she wasn't ready. He ended the relationship because he felt she led him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The man's side: he went through the effort of planning a proposal, probably thinking it was the right time. He was excited and then hurt when she changed her mind. The woman's side: she might have felt pressured by the public proposal, maybe felt that he didn't discuss the engagement plans with her first. She could have felt uncomfortable with the sudden move, leading her to say yes in the moment but change her mind later because she wasn't ready.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think the man should have discussed the proposal with her first instead of surprising her. Proposals are a big step, and doing it without prior discussion could lead to misunderstandings. The woman's response about moving too quickly might be valid. However, the man ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, which could be seen as harsh. He might have been hurt and unable to move past the situation, but cutting her off immediately might not be the healthiest response.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman did say yes publicly, which could be seen as a commitment, and then backing out might be hurtful. But if she wasn't ready, maybe she shouldn't have said yes in the first place. There's a mutual responsibility here. Did the man have a right to feel betrayed? Maybe, but perhaps he could have handled the situation better instead of ending things right away.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the man's actions (proposing without discussing) might be part of the problem, but the woman's change of heart after saying yes is also an issue. However, the question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. If the man didn't discuss the proposal with her, that's a mistake. However, the woman's withdrawal after the yes is also a problem. But the main question is about who is in the wrong. In many relationships, discussing such a major step as marriage is important. Public proposals without prior discussion can lead to pressure, so maybe the man did do something wrong. But the woman's response could also be influenced by her own feelings of being rushed. The answer might hinge on whether the man should have checked in with her first. Since he didn't, perhaps he's partially at fault. The woman's reaction is also a factor, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't discuss it first, leading to her feeling pressured.\n"
