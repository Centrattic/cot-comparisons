      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author proposed on a cruise, got a \"yes,\" but then later the girlfriend changed her mind. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship, blaming her for not being ready and leading him on. He says she was insensitive for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement first, but the girlfriend claims the proposal was too rushed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a public proposal with a photographer, which the girlfriend found too sudden. She said yes but later changed her mind because she wasn't ready. The author ended the relationship, feeling she was insincere.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He went through a lot to plan a romantic proposal, and when she said yes, he got excited. But then she changed her mind, which broke him. He ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. He might argue that once she said yes, she should have meant it, and her retraction was inconsiderate.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might feel that the proposal was rushed without proper discussion. Public proposals can be pressure-inducing, and maybe she was overwhelmed in the moment. Saying yes impulsively and then realizing later wasn't ready could be her issue. But she also might feel that the author didn't take the time to have a serious conversation about marriage first, leading to the misunderstanding.\n\nThe crux here is communication. Marriage is a major life decision, and ideally, there should be discussions before a proposal. If the author didn't talk about marriage plans, then he might have contributed to the problem by springing it on her unexpectedly. However, once she said yes, retracting it later can be seen as insincere, which the author is upset about. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend had legitimate feelings of not being ready, and the public proposal made her feel pressured. She might have said yes in the moment but later realized her true feelings. On the other hand, the author's reaction of ending the relationship might be too harsh if he blames her for not being ready, especially if he didn't discuss the proposal first. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a 50-50. The author could have been more communicative about wanting to get married, and the girlfriend could have been more honest about her readiness. However, after she said yes, retracting it is problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss his intentions beforehand, that's a flaw. But if he's upset about her changing her mind after a commitment, that's another angle.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. In these AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who is more at fault. If the author didn't talk about marriage and proposed impulsively, that's a misstep. But the girlfriend's retraction is also an issue. However, the author's decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity might be justified if she was dishonest after her initial agreement. Alternatively, if the problem was poor communication from both sides, the fault is shared. \n\nIn many cases, the person who proposed and then ended the relationship is seen as less at fault because they were the one taking the initiative, but in this case, the girlfriend changed her mind. It's a tough call. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the main issue is that he didn't discuss engagement with her before the proposal, then he's at fault. However, if the main issue is her retracting her \"yes,\" then she's at fault. The user says the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit split. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because even if he didn't discuss it beforehand, once she agreed, retracting is the bigger issue. But the community often considers that if you spring a proposal on someone without discussion, you can't be surprised if they're not ready. So the author might be at fault for not communicating. But the girlfriend's action of changing her mind after saying yes is also problematic. It's a tricky situation. \n\nIn the end, since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. If the main issue is that the author didn't discuss marriage plans, then he's A. If the main issue is the girlfriend changing her mind, then she's at fault, so the author is not (B). But the user says the author is in the wrong. Hmm. \n\nI think the correct answer is A because the author didn't have that discussion first, leading to the problem. The girlfriend might have been overwhelmed and not ready, but the author's approach contributed. So the answer is A.\n"
