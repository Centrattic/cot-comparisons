I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the proposer is at fault for ending the relationship after his girlfriend changed her mind. \n\nFirst, the man planned a public proposal with a photographer, which is a big deal. He got a \"yes,\" then later the woman retracted it. She felt he moved too fast and didn't discuss engagement first. He was hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive.\n\nNow, who's at fault? The man's actions: setting up a public proposal without prior discussion. Maybe he assumed she was ready to get engaged. The woman's reaction: she said yes in the moment but wasn't ready, leading to confusion. She didn't want to marry him even though she said yes. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The man didn't check if she was ready for marriage before proposing, which could have led to her feeling pressured. But she also changed her mind after saying yes, which is confusing. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions like marriage require mutual understanding. If he didn't discuss it first, he might have assumed she was on board. However, her retraction after the proposal is also problematic. She gave a commitment she wasn't ready for. \n\nThe man ending the relationship because of her insensitivity makes sense if he felt betrayed. She didn't communicate her true feelings before the proposal. But maybe the fault isn't entirely on one side. However, the question is whether the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. \n\nIf he didn't talk about engagement first, he might share some responsibility. But she changed her mind after a commitment, which is a big deal. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In many contexts, a proposal is a serious step, and retracting the acceptance can be hurtful. \n\nSo, is the proposer in the wrong for not discussing first? Possibly. But he had a right to feel hurt. The woman's actions were also inconsiderate. However, the question is about the proposer. If he didn't check in with her before proposing, maybe he's partially at fault. But the main issue is the woman changing her mind. The proposer's decision to end the relationship might be justified given her actions. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. If the proposer didn't discuss engagement first, he might have made a mistake. However, the woman's retraction is also a problem. The answer could be that the proposer isn't entirely at fault. The woman's actions were more hurtful. So, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
