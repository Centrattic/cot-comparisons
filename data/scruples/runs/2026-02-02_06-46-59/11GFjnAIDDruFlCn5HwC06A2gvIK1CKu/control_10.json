      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a proposal gone wrong. The author planned a public proposal on a cruise without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes at first but then changed her mind later. He ended the relationship because he felt she led him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author did plan a public proposal without prior discussion, which might have been a big assumption. He expected her to say yes, but she wasn't ready. She claims that the author moved too quickly and didn't discuss engagement with her first. She changed her mind after the initial \"yes,\" which he found insensitivity.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and expectations. Proposing is a big step, and while it's common to plan a surprise, not discussing it beforehand could lead to misunderstandings. The girlfriend might not have been ready for marriage, and the sudden public proposal might have pressured her into a yes she didn't mean. However, she did say yes initially, and then changed her mind, which could be seen as breaking the promise. The author's reaction is understandable\u2014feeling betrayed and ending the relationship because of the emotional hurt.\n\nBut is the author at fault? Well, he did plan the proposal without discussing it, which could have been a misstep. Expecting an immediate \"yes\" without knowing her feelings might be his part. However, she also had the opportunity to express her hesitation before or during the proposal. The fact that she changed her mind after saying yes in front of others complicates things. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while public proposals are common, they can be risky if the engagement isn't discussed beforehand. The author's assumption that she would say yes without prior conversation might be where he's at fault. However, her changing her mind after the initial acceptance is also problematic. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the proposal was a surprise, and while communication could have been better, her reaction after saying yes is more of the issue. However, the lack of prior discussion does play a role. But the main problem here is her changing her mind after the proposal. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but there are elements of both sides. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
