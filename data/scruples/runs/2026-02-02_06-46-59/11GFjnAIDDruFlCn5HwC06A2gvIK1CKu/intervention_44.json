I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal that was accepted but then retracted. The author proposed on a cruise, set up a big public event with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. They celebrated with champagne and pictures, but later she changed her mind. The author felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship because he couldn't handle the insensitivity. The girlfriend blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Proposing is a significant step, and doing it publicly might add pressure. The girlfriend might have felt overwhelmed, especially if they hadn't discussed the future together. The author didn't talk about the engagement before the proposal, which could have led to her not being ready. On the other hand, once she said yes, retracting it after the celebration could be seen as breaking trust or not being committed.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that the proposal was rushed without proper discussion, making her feel like the author didn't consider her readiness. The author, however, felt hurt and betrayed after she changed her mind after accepting. Both sides have valid points. The author might have made a mistake by not discussing the engagement first, which led to a situation where the proposal wasn't well-timed. But the girlfriend retracting her acceptance after the celebration is also problematic because once you say yes, it's a commitment, even if verbal.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties had roles. The author didn't check in with her about her readiness, and she didn't communicate her feelings clearly after the proposal. However, the act of taking back a \"yes\" after the proposal is a significant issue, as it's a breach of the mutual agreement they had at that moment. The author's decision to end the relationship is a reaction to feeling used or not respected, which is understandable.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. While he could have discussed the engagement first, the main issue is the girlfriend's retraction after accepting. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not overlooking any nuances. The key points are the lack of prior discussion and the retraction. Since the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to check if my analysis aligns.\n"
