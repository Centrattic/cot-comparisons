      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a big public proposal on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He broke up with her because he felt she was insensitive by leading him on.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the proposal was public, she said yes, then retracted it. The man feels betrayed because she didn't want to actually marry him. The woman's side is that he moved too fast by planning a public proposal without discussing engagement first. She said they were moving too quickly, and she wasn't ready. The man argues that she should have told him earlier instead of getting his hopes up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the man is in the wrong. The question is about whether he's at fault for proposing publicly without discussing it. Proposals are a big step, and if he planned it without prior discussion, maybe that's where the issue is. However, proposing is a common practice, even if it's public. But if they hadn't had the conversation about marriage before, that could be a problem. The woman might have felt pressured by the public proposal, leading to her hesitation.\n\nOn the other hand, she said yes publicly, then changed her mind. That's a significant change. When someone says yes to a proposal, especially in a public setting, it's a commitment. But maybe she wasn't mentally prepared. The man's reaction is understandable; getting hopes up and then shattered is tough. However, the woman's refusal to acknowledge the issue and her claim that it was the man's fault for moving too fast could be a problem.\n\nThe man ended the relationship because of her \"insensitivity.\" Is that fair? If she changed her mind after saying yes, that's a major issue. But if the proposal was rushed without proper discussion, that's on him. So there's a balance here.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he proposed without discussing their future plans, maybe he was moving too fast. But she also changed her mind after a commitment. Both parties have some responsibility. The man might be in the wrong for not discussing the proposal, but the woman is also at fault for retracting her acceptance. However, the question is specifically about the author (the man) being in the wrong. The AITA is whether he's at fault for the breakup.\n\nIf the woman changed her mind after saying yes, that's a major betrayal. But the man's part is about the method of proposal. The woman's argument is that he moved too fast. So if they hadn't talked about marriage, the proposal might have been premature. The man could be in the wrong for not having those discussions. However, the woman's refusal to accept responsibility after saying yes is also a problem. But the question is about the author's fault. If the man is asking whether he's in the wrong for proposing without discussing it, then maybe yes. But if the woman changed her mind, maybe he's not wrong. It's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, if someone proposes without discussing future plans, that's seen as moving too fast. The woman's claim that he did that could make him partially at fault. However, the woman retracting her acceptance is also a problem. The man's reaction is valid, but maybe he shouldn't have ended it over her retraction if there was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, if she was insincere in her yes, that's on her. But the initial proposal's timing might be on him.\n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because the woman changed her mind after committing. However, there's a chance he's partially at fault for the proposal method. But the main issue is the retraction. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
