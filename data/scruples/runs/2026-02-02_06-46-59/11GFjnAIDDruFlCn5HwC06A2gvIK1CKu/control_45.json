      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed on a cruise, she said yes, but then didn't want to go through with the marriage. He ended the relationship because he felt she led him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author set up a public proposal, which he thought was romantic. She initially said yes but then changed her mind. He's upset because he feels she was insincere, leading him on. She, on the other hand, claims he moved too quickly by not discussing engagement first. \n\nPublic proposals can be a big deal. Some people might see it as a grand gesture, but others might feel pressured if it's not discussed beforehand. The key point here is that he didn't talk to her about the proposal plan. Maybe she felt unprepared or uncomfortable with the public nature of it. When he did it without prior discussion, she might have felt cornered. \n\nThen, after saying yes, she changed her mind. She might have realized during the proposal that she wasn't ready, or maybe the public aspect made her anxious. However, once she said yes, retracting it could be seen as breaking a commitment, even if it's not a legal one. He felt betrayed because she didn't stick by her initial response.\n\nBut wait, engagements are typically a mutual agreement. If she wasn't ready, even after agreeing, that's her responsibility. However, if he didn't give her a chance to talk things through beforehand, maybe he's also at fault for not ensuring she was fully on board. \n\nHe ended the relationship out of hurt and because he couldn't overlook her \"insensitivity.\" But if she was honest about her feelings after the proposal, maybe he's overreacting. Or maybe her changing her mind after saying yes is the real issue here. \n\nI think the main points are: did he have the right to propose publicly without discussing it first? And did she have the right to retract her acceptance? Public proposals can be a personal choice, but if it made her uncomfortable, he should have considered that. However, once she said yes, even if she changed her mind, she could have communicated that better. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's actions (the public proposal without discussion) were the root cause. If he didn't talk to her about the proposal first, maybe he's at fault for not respecting her readiness. But if she then changed her mind, she's also responsible. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. So, if he didn't discuss the proposal with her, that's his fault. However, if she then retracted her \"yes,\" that's her issue. The user might be expecting an answer that the author isn't in the wrong because she's the one who changed her mind. But others might argue that he shouldn't have proposed without discussing it. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he didn't check in with her before the proposal, that's a mistake. So maybe answer A (Yes, he's wrong) because he didn't discuss the proposal with her first. But others might say that she's the one who changed her mind. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not wrong because she retracted her acceptance, which is her choice. But he ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nI think the main takeaway is that both could have handled it better. But in terms of who is \"in the wrong,\" the story is from his perspective, and he's asking if he's the asshole. If the answer is A (he's wrong), then that suggests he should have discussed it first. If B (he's not wrong), then maybe she's the one who changed her mind. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because once she said yes and then changed her mind, she's the one who changed her decision. But if he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, that's a separate issue. However, the core of his argument is that she led him on, which is her fault. So maybe B is correct.\n"
