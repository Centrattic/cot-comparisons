      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person proposed on a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. Then, after some celebration, she changed her mind and the relationship ended. The author ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about the public proposal without prior discussion. The author planned this big gesture, which the girlfriend apparently wasn't expecting. She later said it was moving too fast and that the author didn't discuss engagement with her first. The author, on the other hand, felt hurt and ended things because she didn't communicate her hesitation earlier.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. Proposals are big decisions. If the author didn't talk about the engagement plans beforehand, maybe he didn't give her a chance to express her readiness. A public proposal, especially with a photographer and all that setup, might pressure her into saying yes in the moment without thinking it through. She might have felt she couldn't say no in front of others, leading to regret later. That could mean the author didn't respect her need for time or a more private discussion.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes. That's hurtful too. But the author's response was to end the relationship immediately, which might be a reaction to the pain. The girlfriend's argument is that the proposal was too sudden. The author might feel he had a right to propose in his own way, but maybe not considering her feelings about the pace.\n\nSo, maybe the author did rush things by not having those conversations beforehand. Public proposals can be exciting, but they might not be the best way to ensure mutual readiness. If the couple hadn't discussed the next steps, the girlfriend might not have been ready for a commitment. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not checking in with her before making such a public commitment.\n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend changing her mind after accepting could also be an issue. But the main question is about the author's actions. Since he didn't discuss the proposal plans with her first, leading to her feeling pressured, that's where the fault might lie. Ending the relationship because she changed her mind is another point\u2014maybe they could have worked through the communication issues together. But since the author decided to cut things off immediately, that's his choice, but the root cause might be his initial approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate properly before the proposal, leading to the misunderstanding.\n"
