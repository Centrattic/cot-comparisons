We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person proposed during a cruise, set up a big public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. They celebrated with champagne and pictures, but then later she changed her mind. The proposer felt heartbroken and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. The question is whether the proposer is at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The proposer planned a public proposal, which can be a big move. Maybe they didn't talk about marriage enough beforehand. The girlfriend said they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready. She might feel pressured. On the other hand, the proposer was hurt and ended the relationship because she changed her mind after saying yes.\n\nIn many relationships, a proposal is a significant commitment. If the girlfriend agreed but then changed her mind, that's hurtful. However, if the proposer didn't discuss marriage expectations before the proposal, maybe they contributed to the problem. But once she said yes, retracting it is a betrayal. The proposer ending the relationship because of that might be justified if they feel betrayed. However, the way the proposer ended things without allowing discussion might be too abrupt.\n\nBut the key question is about fault. The proposer might be wrong for not discussing the proposal more, but the girlfriend's action of taking back her \"yes\" is also problematic. However, the user's initial thought is that the author (proposer) is at fault. I need to decide if the proposer is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI think both have some faults, but the main issue is the girlfriend retracting her acceptance. The proposer's decision to end things might be a reaction to that, which is understandable. So maybe the proposer isn't in the wrong. But if the proposer didn't communicate enough before the proposal, then some fault lies there. However, once she said yes, retracting it is the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
