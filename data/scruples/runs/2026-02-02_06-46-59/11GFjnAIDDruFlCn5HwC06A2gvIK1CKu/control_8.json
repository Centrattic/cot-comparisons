      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author proposed on a cruise with a setup, including a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, but then later changed her mind. The author was really upset and ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. She said the problem was that he planned a public proposal without discussing the engagement first, and that they were moving too fast. He argues that she should have told him earlier instead of leading him on.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are about communication. The author didn't talk to his girlfriend about getting engaged before the proposal. She felt that the public proposal was too rushed and that they weren't ready. He thinks she was insensitive for changing her mind after accepting. \n\nI know that in relationships, communication is key. Proposing without discussing the future plans could be a big mistake. It's possible that the author didn't check in with her about whether she was ready to get engaged. If he had that conversation, maybe she would have been honest about not being ready. On the other hand, she did say yes, so she might have felt hurt by his setup but then changed her mind later, which could be hurtful to him. \n\nSo is the author wrong for not talking to her first? Maybe. Because proposing is a significant step, and expecting a \"yes\" without prior discussion could be seen as not respecting her readiness. She might have felt pressured in the moment. However, she also changed her mind after saying yes, which is a big deal. But she did express that she wasn't ready after the proposal. \n\nI think both parties have some responsibility here, but the question is specifically about the author's fault. If the author had discussed engagement plans before the proposal, maybe this wouldn't have happened. So he might be in the wrong for not having that conversation first. But then again, she could have been honest then. The answer depends on whether the lack of prior discussion is considered a mistake. I'm leaning towards the author being at least partially at fault for not checking in with her readiness, so maybe answer A. But I'm not 100% sure because the situation is complex.\n"
