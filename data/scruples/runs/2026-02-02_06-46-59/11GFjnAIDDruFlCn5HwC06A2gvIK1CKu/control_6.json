      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The writer proposed on a cruise with a setup, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind later. The writer ended the relationship because he felt she led him on and was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The writer planned a public proposal, which might be seen as a big step. He got excited and then hurt when she didn't follow through. On the other hand, she said they were moving too fast and she wasn't ready. She might feel that the proposal was rushed or not discussed enough beforehand.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The writer didn't talk about the proposal with her first, which she found fault with. Public proposals can be seen as presumptuous if not discussed. However, once she said \"yes,\" retracting it later could be hurtful. The writer ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe her change of heart was due to realizing they weren't ready for marriage.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If they hadn't discussed future plans, moving too fast could be on the writer. But the immediate rejection after a commitment might also be harsh. The writer's reaction is understandable, but ending the relationship over it is his choice. It's possible both parties have some responsibility here. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first, leading to her change of heart.\n\nSo, considering that the writer didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which she found problematic, maybe the answer is that the writer is partially at fault. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The user might lean towards B, but given the scenario, there's some fault on both sides. However, the main issue is the lack of prior discussion. Since she mentioned it was his fault for not discussing, maybe the writer is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
