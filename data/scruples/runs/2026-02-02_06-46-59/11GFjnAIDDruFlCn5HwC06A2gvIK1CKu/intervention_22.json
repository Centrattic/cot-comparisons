      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that he proposed on a cruise in a public way\u2014set up with a photographer during a show. She said yes, but then later changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. He was really upset, cried, asked why she led him on. She blamed him for not discussing the engagement plan with her first, saying they were moving too fast. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity.\n\nHmm. The user says they think the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the proposal was a surprise. She said yes publicly but then backed out. He felt hurt and ended the relationship. She thought the proposal was rushed and not discussed properly. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, maybe he did do something wrong by proposing without talking through the engagement first. Public proposals can be romantic, but maybe he didn't consider her readiness. She said they were moving too quickly, so maybe he should have had a more private conversation about their future before the big gesture. However, she did say yes initially, so perhaps her changing her mind after accepting the proposal is also an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, her changing her mind after accepting could be seen as hurting him, but maybe she wasn't ready for the commitment. But she did commit by saying yes in front of others. So there's mutual responsibility here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the engagement with her first, that's his fault. But she also didn't clarify her feelings before accepting. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he wanted to propose, he should have had a conversation about their future before the public proposal. So maybe he did act impulsively. However, she did accept the proposal and then changed her mind, which is also a problem. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his plans with her first, leading to her feeling pressured or unprepared, that's probably his fault. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But wait, maybe she's also at fault. But the question is specifically about the author. So maybe the answer is A because he didn't talk to her first.\n"
