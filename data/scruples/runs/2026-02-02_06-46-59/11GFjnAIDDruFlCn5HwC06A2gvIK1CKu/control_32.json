      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal during a cruise. The author set up a public proposal with a photographer, the girlfriend said yes, then later changed her mind. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship because he thought she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author did plan a big proposal without discussing it with his partner first. That could be seen as moving too fast or not being considerate of her feelings. Public proposals can be overwhelming, especially if the other person wasn't expecting it. The girlfriend said she wasn't ready and that he moved too quickly. She might feel pressured or that her needs weren't considered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt that once she said yes, she should have followed through. He might feel that she wasn't honest about her feelings and that she used him for the proposal setup. Ending the relationship because of the hurt and betrayal makes sense from his perspective.\n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. The author didn't talk about the proposal first, which is a major life decision. The girlfriend had the right to change her mind after the proposal because it's her decision to make, but the author was left in a vulnerable state. The girlfriend might have realized she wasn't ready, but the way she handled it could be seen as insensitive too.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, by not discussing the proposal beforehand, he might have forced her into a public commitment she wasn't ready for. That could have led to her feeling pressured. However, the fact that she changed her mind after saying yes is also problematic. It's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. But the question is specifically about the author. The key issue here is the lack of prior communication about the proposal. If the author had talked to her about the engagement first, maybe they could have avoided this situation. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not checking in with her before the proposal. The girlfriend's reaction could be a result of feeling that he didn't respect her pace. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author didn't discuss the proposal first, leading to the public engagement without her readiness, he might be in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's change of heart after the yes is also an issue. But the initial action of the author was to not communicate, which could have contributed to the problem. So, leaning towards A, but it's a bit of a gray area. Alternatively, maybe B, because the girlfriend's actions were also wrong. Hmm.\n"
