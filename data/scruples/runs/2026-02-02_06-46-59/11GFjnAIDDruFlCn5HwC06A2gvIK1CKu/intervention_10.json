      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe guy proposed on a cruise with a photographer, and she said yes. They celebrated, but then later she changed her mind and didn't want to get married. He felt broken, cried, and ended the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity. She said the problem was that he planned the public proposal without discussing it with her first, and that they were moving too quickly. She wasn't ready. The author thinks the guy is in the wrong, but is curious about the response.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about consent and communication. The guy planned a big proposal without talking to her first about marriage. The woman said yes initially but then changed her mind. The guy feels betrayed because she didn't stick with her \"yes,\" while the woman feels that the proposal was rushed and not discussed properly.\n\nFirst, from the woman's perspective: she might not have been prepared for marriage, even though she said yes in the moment. It's possible she was overwhelmed by the public proposal and didn't realize the commitment they were making. She might have felt pressured or excited in the moment but later felt differently. She's saying that the problem was the lack of discussion about marriage, so she wasn't ready. That's a valid point. Proposing can be a big step, and discussing the future together before a proposal is important. If he didn't talk about marriage and just went for the surprise, maybe he didn't consider her readiness.\n\nFrom the man's perspective: he was excited, set up a romantic proposal, and she accepted. Then she changed her mind, which he feels is leading him on. He ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. He might feel that once she said yes, she should have committed. But maybe he didn't take her feelings into account when planning the surprise. The public proposal might have added pressure on her, and if they hadn't discussed marriage yet, that could be a problem.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The woman changed her mind after the proposal, which is hard, but if the proposal was a surprise and they hadn't discussed the commitment, maybe she wasn't ready. The man didn't communicate his intentions, leading to a situation where she might not have been fully prepared. However, once she said yes, changing her mind after the fact is also difficult for the other person. But the man's reaction of ending the relationship because of her insensitivity might be harsh. Maybe he should have tried to understand her perspective more before breaking up.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the man) is in the wrong. If the woman felt pressured by an unplanned public proposal, then the man might be at fault for not discussing it first. On the other hand, the woman changed her mind after accepting, which could be seen as insensitive. But the root cause might be the lack of communication from the man's side. So, maybe the man is in the wrong for not talking about marriage before the proposal. However, the woman's decision to take back her \"yes\" is also complicated. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A (yes) because he didn't communicate properly before the proposal. The woman's change of heart might be a result of that. So, A.\n"
