      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario. The author proposed during a cruise, set up a public proposal with a photographer. The girlfriend said yes, celebrated, then later changed her mind. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive. The girlfriend's argument is that the public proposal without discussing the engagement first made her feel pressured, leading her to say yes in the moment but not be ready later.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here: the proposal was public and planned without prior discussion. The girlfriend felt they were moving too fast. The author is upset that she changed her mind after the initial \"yes,\" while she's upset because he didn't talk to her first about getting engaged. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author might think that once she said yes, that's a commitment, but maybe she wasn't truly ready. On the other hand, a public proposal can be overwhelming, especially if it's not discussed beforehand. Engagement is a big step, so communication is key. Maybe the author didn't involve her in planning the proposal, which could have caused her to feel pressured. But she also said yes publicly, which in some cultures might be seen as a commitment. However, if she wasn't ready, maybe she didn't mean it at the time.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. Is that justified? If she felt pressured, maybe the proposal's setup was problematic. But she changed her mind after the initial acceptance. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. \n\nI think the author's mistake was not discussing the proposal with her first. A proper engagement usually involves mutual discussion. A surprise proposal could come from a good place, but if it's not discussed, it might lead to misunderstandings. The girlfriend had the right to change her mind if she wasn't ready, but the author's reaction might be too harsh. However, she did say yes and then retracted it. The author's hurt is valid, but ending the relationship over that might be extreme. \n\nSo, where does the fault lie? The author's actions might have contributed to her feeling pressured, but she also changed her mind after the commitment. It's a 50-50 situation perhaps. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A because he didn't discuss the proposal first. But maybe B because she changed her mind after yes. Hmm. I need to decide. If I go with the common advice, communication is key. The author didn't communicate his intentions, which led to her feeling rushed. So the author is partially at fault. Therefore, answer A. But another angle is that she retracted her acceptance, which is also her choice. But in terms of responsibility, the author's actions contributed. So AITA usually holds both parties accountable sometimes. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. Given that, maybe the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first, leading to her feeling pressured. So answer A.\n"
