      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who proposed is in the wrong after the engagement was called off. \n\nFirst, the guy planned a big, public proposal on a cruise. He used a photographer and set it up during a show. She said yes, then later changed her mind. He's upset because she led him on, and she's upset because he didn't talk to her about the engagement first.\n\nSo, the key points here are the public proposal without prior discussion and her changing her mind. Traditionally, some people might think that a proposal should be a private, heartfelt moment, and involving a photographer adds to the public aspect. But in modern times, public proposals are more common, though they can be controversial.\n\nShe said they were moving too quickly. He didn't talk to her about marriage before the proposal. That's a valid point. If the proposal was a surprise, she might not have had the chance to prepare or share her feelings. Maybe she felt pressured, leading to her change of heart. But she did say yes initially, which complicates things. \n\nHe ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but she might feel blindsided. The conflict here is between his need for commitment and her not being ready. Without prior communication, the proposal might have been a shock. However, she didn't clarify her stance until after the proposal, which hurt him.\n\nSo, who's at fault? He didn't discuss marriage plans, leading to an unexpected proposal. She didn't express her hesitation before accepting. Both might share some responsibility. But the question is whether the author (the proposer) is in the wrong. \n\nHe set up a public proposal without discussing it first. That could be seen as presumptuous. However, she accepted and then changed her mind. Her actions are also problematic. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's wrong) because he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, leading to her surprise and subsequent change of heart. Or B (No) because she had the chance to say no initially but didn't. \n\nHmm. The key issue is the lack of prior communication. If he had talked to her about marriage, maybe she would have shared her feelings. By springing it on her, he might have contributed to the problem. However, her change of heart after saying yes is also a factor. But the question is about who's wrong. Depending on cultural or personal values, the answer might vary. In some views, the proposer is wrong for not discussing it first. In others, the proposer isn't wrong, as she didn't object at the time. \n\nI think the answer is A because not discussing the engagement first led to her feeling pressured. But others might argue it's B. Need to check for similar situations. In many cases, the person proposing is sometimes seen as having some responsibility if they didn't talk about the future. So, A might be the better answer here.\n"
