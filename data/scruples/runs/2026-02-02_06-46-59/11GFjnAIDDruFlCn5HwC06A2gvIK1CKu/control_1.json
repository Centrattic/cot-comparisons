      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after his girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to the proposal. \n\nFirst, the situation: he planned a public proposal during a cruise, set it up with a photographer, etc. She said yes, but later changed her mind. He was heartbroken, cried, and they ended the relationship. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing the engagement first. He thinks she was insensible.\n\nSo, the key points here. Public proposal without prior discussion. She agreed, but then retracted. He ended it because he felt she led him on. She thought he was rushing things.\n\nTraditionally, a proposal is a significant step, and a public one adds pressure. But in many relationships, it's expected that both partners discuss major life decisions before a proposal. The author didn't talk about marriage plans with her first. She said they were moving too fast, which suggests she wasn't ready for that commitment yet. Her changing her mind after saying yes is hurtful, but maybe his approach was also a problem.\n\nIs he at fault for not discussing it beforehand? If they hadn't had that conversation, maybe he should have been more cautious. On the other hand, she did say yes, then took it back. That's a big shift, and it's understandable he felt betrayed. However, ending the relationship immediately after such a public proposal might come off as impulsive. \n\nBut from his perspective, she led him on, which is hurtful. She might have not been honest about her feelings. He had a right to be upset. However, maybe he could have handled it differently. Still, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nLooking at both sides, he didn't discuss the proposal with her, which could be a mistake. But she changed her mind after committing, which is also a problem. The user is asking if he's wrong. The answer might hinge on whether not discussing the proposal was his fault. If the norm is to discuss marriage plans before proposing, then he's in the wrong. However, if the norm isn't so strict, maybe not. \n\nBut in many cases, people do discuss marriage plans before a proposal. So, by not doing that, he might have rushed in. However, she agreed publicly, then retracted it later, causing him more pain. So, both have some fault. But the question is specifically about the author. \n\nThe answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) if his failure to discuss the proposal was the main issue. Alternatively, B (No) if her retracting the yes was the main issue. It's a bit tricky. \n\nIn the AITA context, often the person who makes the other feel led on is at fault. But in this case, she took back her yes. Maybe both are at fault. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong because she retracted her commitment, which is worse. But maybe he's partially at fault. \n\nBut the options are only A or B. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer is either yes or no. If the consensus is that he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, then he's at fault. But maybe not. Because even if you don't discuss it, if she says yes, then takes it back, that's her problem. \n\nSo perhaps the answer is B (No), because he's not in the wrong. She changed her mind after agreeing, which is more damaging. His decision to end the relationship because of her insensitivity might be justified.\n"
