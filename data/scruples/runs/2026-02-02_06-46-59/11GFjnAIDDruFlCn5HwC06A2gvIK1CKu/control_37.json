I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that he proposed during a cruise, she said yes, but then later changed her mind. He feels hurt and ended the relationship because she was insensitive. She said it was his fault for not discussing the proposal first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his partner first. That might be a problem because a proposal is a big step, and communication is important. The girlfriend said she wasn't ready, so maybe she felt pressured or blindsided.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was excited and proposed, thinking she was okay with the direction. When she changed her mind, he felt led on, which is understandable. But he ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her \"insensitivity,\" which might be harsh. Maybe there's a lack of understanding here about different pacing in relationships.\n\nIs the author at fault for not talking about the proposal first? Possibly. Big decisions like marriage should be discussed before making a public commitment. However, the girlfriend's reaction of saying yes and then backing out without explaining her feelings immediately could also be seen as insensitivity. She didn't clarify her feelings after accepting, which might have contributed to the hurt.\n\nThe key points are communication from both sides. The author didn't check in about moving forward, and the girlfriend didn't communicate her true feelings until after the proposal. Both might share some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since proposing without discussion can pressure the other person, especially if they weren't ready, he might have made a mistake in not having that conversation first. However, ending the relationship over her changing her mind could be a reaction to a breach of trust, but maybe his approach wasn't the best either.\n\nSo, is the answer A or B? The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is that he didn't discuss the proposal first, then A (he's wrong). If the main issue is her changing her mind without clarification, then B (he's not wrong). Given that, perhaps the author has some responsibility for not discussing the proposal beforehand, but the girlfriend's actions also contributed. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his intentions first, which is a key factor in such a major decision, he might be at fault. But the answer could be A. However, maybe the answer is B because the girlfriend's response was also flawed. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, if he did something wrong by not discussing the proposal, then A. But if both are at fault, but the question is only about the author, then maybe A. Alternatively, the answer could be B if the main issue is the girlfriend's actions. I'm a bit torn here. The answer might be B because the girlfriend changed her mind without immediate clarification, but the author's approach could be questioned. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The fact that he didn't discuss the proposal first could make him at fault. So maybe A. But I need to decide.\n"
