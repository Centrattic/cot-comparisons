      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong.\n\nFirst, the author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes during the proposal but later changed her mind. He felt hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitively leading him on. She, on the other hand, said they were moving too fast and he didn't talk about the engagement beforehand.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The key points are communication and expectations. Proposing is a significant step, and discussing it beforehand is important. The author didn't talk about the engagement plan with her, which she considered moving too fast. She said yes in the moment but realized later it wasn't what she wanted. That could be because she was caught off guard or felt pressured by the public setting.\n\nOn the other hand, she didn't clearly communicate her hesitation during the proposal. She said yes and then changed her mind, which could be hurtful. However, the author didn't check in with her about the timing of the proposal. Both sides have some responsibility here. The author didn't discuss the proposal, and she didn't express her true feelings until after saying yes.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whose actions were more inconsiderate. The author proceeded with the proposal without prior discussion, which is a key factor. She changed her mind after the proposal, which is also an issue. However, the author's reaction of ending the relationship might be seen as justified if he felt she was insensitively leading him on. Alternatively, maybe he should have been more understanding if she was conflicted.\n\nIn many cases, not discussing such a big step with a partner can be a misstep. So the author might share some blame for not checking in with her first. However, the fact that she changed her mind after agreeing could also be problematic. It's a tricky situation where both have faults. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't talk to her about the proposal, which is a major decision, he might be at fault for not considering her readiness. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But some might argue B (No) because she didn't clarify her feelings either. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the key is the lack of communication from his side. So I think A is the answer here.\n"
