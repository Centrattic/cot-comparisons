      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong when their ex-girlfriend took back her \"yes\" after a public proposal.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author proposed on a cruise with a setup, including a photographer. The girlfriend said yes initially but then changed her mind, leading to a breakup. The author is upset and thinks she should have said no from the start, while she claims he moved too fast by planning a public proposal without discussing engagement first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author planned a public proposal, which can be pressure. The ex-girlfriend felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready for marriage. She changed her mind after initially saying yes, which is really hurtful. The author ended the relationship because he felt betrayed and couldn't overlook her insensitivity, while she thinks the problem was his rushed proposal.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Proposing in a public setting can be seen as pressuring the other person, but it's also a common way people propose. However, the key point here is that the couple didn't discuss engagement beforehand. If the author didn't talk to her about marriage plans before the proposal, he might have assumed she was ready, which could be his fault. But if they had been discussing marriage and the proposal was a surprise, that's a different scenario. The ex-girlfriend's argument is that he moved too fast without discussing it, which suggests communication issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-girlfriend said yes publicly and then changed her mind. That's a huge emotional blow, and the author's reaction is understandable. But maybe she had reasons to change her mind, like not being emotionally ready. However, once she said yes, changing her mind without a valid reason (like discovering a problem in the relationship) could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, that's a problem. Proposing without prior discussion can be seen as rushing things. However, the ex-girlfriend's actions of leading him on and then breaking off after a commitment are also problematic. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). Considering the situation, both parties have some fault. The author didn't discuss the proposal first, and the ex didn't consider the consequences of changing her mind. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. If the main issue is the public proposal without prior discussion, then A might be the answer. If the main issue is the ex's actions, then the author isn't in the wrong (B). \n\nIn many cases, proposals are planned as surprises, but communication is key. If the author didn't talk to her about getting married before the proposal, that's a mistake. But if they had been discussing it and the proposal was just a surprise, then maybe not. The ex's claim is that the proposal was too public and they were moving too fast. The author ended the relationship because he felt led on, which is a valid reaction. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No) because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main fault could lie with the ex for changing her mind after saying yes. However, if the author didn't communicate properly, that's a point. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex is the one who changed her mind and caused the emotional harm, the author's reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
