      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, got a yes, but then the girl changed her mind later. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author set up a big proposal without discussing it with her first. Maybe that's where the problem started. Proposing is a huge step, and doing it publicly without prior discussion could be seen as rushing things. The girl said they were moving too fast and wasn't ready. So perhaps the author didn't consider her readiness, leading to her second thoughts.\n\nBut then she said yes initially and then changed her mind. That's confusing. Maybe she was caught off guard by the public proposal and didn't realize the commitment until later. However, after saying yes, she didn't follow through, which would be hurtful. The author feels betrayed because she led him on. But her response was that he rushed her, which might have contributed to her not being ready.\n\nIs the author at fault for not discussing the engagement plans first? Traditionally, some people think that discussing marriage plans before a proposal is important. If he didn't talk to her about their future together, maybe he was assuming she was ready. On the other hand, she might have appreciated being asked directly, but then changed her mind after realizing the commitment.\n\nThe girl's reaction could be seen as a valid response to feeling pressured. If he didn't check in with her about their relationship status before proposing, that's a misstep. But after she said yes, her backing out would be hurtful. However, in the moment, she might have been overwhelmed by the public proposal and realized she wasn't ready.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But if he didn't set the right expectations by discussing engagement first, maybe he's also at fault. Communication is key in relationships, especially for such a significant decision. So, the author might have rushed into the proposal without proper communication, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, both parties have some responsibility. The girl changed her mind after saying yes, which is painful, but the author didn't discuss the engagement with her first. Depending on the perspective, the answer could be that the author is also in the wrong for not having those conversations. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
