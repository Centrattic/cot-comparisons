      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a proposal gone wrong. The guy planned a big, public proposal on a cruise, and she initially said yes but then changed her mind. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The key points here are the public proposal without prior discussion and her sudden change of heart. The girl claims she wasn't ready and the engagement was moving too fast. The guy feels she led him on and didn't communicate her feelings sooner.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Proposing in a public setting without discussing the topic beforehand might have been a hasty move. If the couple hadn't talked about marriage plans before, the guy might have jumped into a proposal too quickly. The girl, on the other hand, might have been uncertain but didn't express her reservations, leading to the confusion. \n\nBut when she said yes and then changed her mind, that's a big deal. Trust and honesty are important. However, she might have been overwhelmed by the public nature of the proposal. The guy's reaction is understandable, but ending the relationship over this might be seen as extreme. However, if she was insincere, maybe he's justified. \n\nAlternatively, she could have been honest before the proposal. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, that's a mistake. But she also didn't communicate her feelings. However, after she said yes and then changed her mind, that's her problem. The guy's anger at her insensitivity might be valid if she was indeed leading him on. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions were the main issue. If the proposal was a surprise without dialogue, he shares some blame. But if she didn't communicate her true feelings and then changed her mind after a commitment, she's at fault. The user is asking if the author is wrong. The answer could be that he's not wrong because she didn't prepare him for the proposal and then retracted her acceptance. But if he should have discussed the proposal first, then he's partially wrong. \n\nIn many cases, public proposals are common, but if the relationship wasn't discussing marriage, it's risky. Since she said yes but then changed her mind, maybe he's not in the wrong. The key is that she led him on after saying yes. So the answer is B (No).\n"
