      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the scenario is that the author proposed to his girlfriend on a cruise, she said yes, but then later changed her mind. He was really upset, and she blamed him for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement first. He ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man planned a public proposal, which might have been a surprise. She said yes but then changed her mind. He's upset and feels betrayed. She thinks the problem was him moving too quickly without discussing it first. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nLooking at the situation, proposing is a big step. Typically, people discuss marriage before a formal proposal. If he didn't have that conversation and she wasn't ready, maybe he did move too quickly. But on the other hand, she did say yes, and then changed her mind. That's a big commitment, and her changing her mind after accepting could be hurtful. \n\nHe ended the relationship because he couldn't overlook her insensitivity. She blamed him for the proposal method. Maybe he should have talked to her first about engagement. But she also led him on by saying yes and then backing out. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. If he didn't discuss it beforehand, maybe he shares some responsibility. However, her going back on her yes is also a problem. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, proposals are usually based on mutual understanding. If there was no prior discussion, he might have assumed commitment without her being ready. But she took back her acceptance, which is a bigger betrayal. \n\nI think both have some fault, but the question is specifically about the author. Did he do something wrong? Maybe proposing without discussing first was a mistake. But if she changed her mind after accepting, that's her fault. \n\nThe user might be looking for whether he should have known she wasn't ready. If he didn't talk to her first, maybe he is at least partially responsible. However, she also took back her answer, which is a major issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because she changed her mind after saying yes, which is a bigger issue. But if the problem was him moving too fast without discussion, then maybe A. \n\nBut the main point is that he proposed without prior discussion, which could be a mistake. However, she's the one who changed her answer after accepting. In terms of responsibility, the author's action (proposing without discussion) might be part of the problem, but she's the one who took back her commitment. \n\nI think the answer here is B (he's not in the wrong) because she went back on her acceptance, which is a bigger betrayal. The fact that he didn't discuss engagement beforehand is a factor, but the main wrong here is her changing her mind after saying yes. So he's not in the wrong.\n"
