      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to his proposal. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author planned a proposal during a cruise with a photographer, which seems like a big commitment. The girlfriend said yes, but later changed her mind. The author felt led on and ended the relationship because he couldn't accept her insensitivity. She blamed him for moving too fast and not discussing marriage first.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he put a lot into the proposal, maybe expecting a serious commitment. She agreed but then backed out, which caused emotional pain. He felt she was insensitive for not being honest from the start.\n\nHer perspective: She might have been under pressure during the proposal. Maybe she was excited in the moment but realized she wasn't ready. She claims moving too quickly was the issue. She could have felt unprepared for marriage and wanted to avoid leading him on, but her reaction came after the proposal.\n\nNow, the key points. Did the author do something wrong? Proposing in a public way without discussing it first could be seen as pressuring her. Some people might think that engagement is a big step and should be discussed before the proposal. However, proposing is a common tradition, and many people do it without prior discussion. The girlfriend's reaction might be her own unpreparedness rather than his fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the author ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. But he admitted to feeling broken and crying, which shows he was hurt. Ending the relationship because of her change of heart is a choice he made, possibly due to feeling betrayed.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't pressure her beyond the proposal (which is a normal thing to do), then maybe not. But if he didn't consider her readiness and forced a proposal without talking about marriage, that could be an issue. She might have felt cornered, hence changing her mind later.\n\nThe author's main argument is that she didn't communicate her feelings. She argues that the proposal was too fast. The crux is communication. If they hadn't discussed marriage before, maybe the proposal was a surprise that caught her off guard. However, she could have expressed her feelings before or after the proposal but chose not to until later.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could have discussed the proposal more, and she could have been honest about her readiness. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the question is AITA, the community would weigh both sides. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that the proposer should have checked in with the partner about their readiness. However, proposals are often surprises. The fact that she said yes in the moment but then changed her mind shows her own uncertainty. The author's hurt is valid, but he ended the relationship, which might be his own choice based on the pain he felt.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author's approach was the cause. If he planned it without discussion, maybe he's partially at fault. But since she changed her mind after agreeing, it's a mutual issue. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (No) because he tried to propose, she said yes, then changed her mind. He wasn't in the wrong for proposing, but maybe for not discussing it first. But depending on the community's view, maybe he's not the one at fault.\n"
