      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're at fault for their ex girlfriend taking back her \"yes\" after they proposed on a cruise. They set up a big proposal with a photographer, got a yes, celebrated with champagne and photos, then later in the room, she said she didn't actually want to marry them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The user proposed in a public and emotional setting, maybe without having discussed the idea of marriage beforehand. The ex girlfriend says it was the user's fault for moving too quickly and not discussing the engagement first. The user ended the relationship because they felt she was insensitive and led them on.\n\nSo, was the proposal done without prior discussion? That's a crucial factor. Proposing is a big step, and ideally, couples should talk about their future and the idea of marriage before making such a public commitment. If the user didn't have that conversation, maybe they rushed things. But then, the ex girlfriend said yes immediately, which could mean she was caught off guard. Maybe she didn't realize the implications until later, especially if the proposal was a surprise. \n\nThe user is upset because she changed her mind after agreeing. But is the user in the wrong for not discussing it first? The ex girlfriend's argument is that the user moved too fast. If they didn't have a serious talk about their relationship goals, then jumping to a proposal might have been premature. However, the user might have thought she was ready since she said yes at first. \n\nThe user ended the relationship due to the ex girlfriend's \"insensitivity.\" That's a bit harsh. People can have moments of hesitation, especially under pressure or after a big emotional event. The ex girlfriend might have been overwhelmed and needed time to process. But the user's reaction to ending the relationship immediately could be seen as impulsive. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex girlfriend's actions\u2014saying yes and then changing her mind\u2014could be considered inconsiderate. Once she said yes, the user likely felt committed, and her retraction might have been abrupt and hurtful. But the user also didn't check in with her before the proposal. \n\nSo, who is at fault? The user might share some responsibility for not discussing the proposal in advance. The ex girlfriend also might be at fault for changing her mind after agreeing. It's a bit of a complex situation. However, the user's decision to end the relationship because of her change of heart could be seen as the right move because if she's not ready to commit, it's not a sustainable future. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the public proposal without prior discussion. If the user didn't talk about the engagement first, that could be a mistake. However, the ex girlfriend's retraction after a yes is also a big problem. The user's reaction to the retraction is what's in question. \n\nIn some perspectives, the user shouldn't have proposed without being sure. But if the ex girlfriend didn't communicate her lack of readiness before, maybe the user isn't entirely at fault. It's a two-way communication issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The ex girlfriend's insensitivity in retracting her acceptance after the proposal is a significant issue. The user did set up a proposal, but if the ex girlfriend genuinely wasn't ready and didn't express that before, then the user isn't the one who's wrong here. Ending the relationship because of such a betrayal of trust makes sense. However, if the user had discussed engagement plans beforehand, they might have a different outcome. But in this case, the ex girlfriend's actions after the \"yes\" are more problematic.\n"
