      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a proposal that went wrong. The man planned a public proposal on a cruise with a photographer, and the woman initially said yes but then changed her mind. He felt hurt and ended the relationship, thinking she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The man planned a big proposal without discussing it with her first. Some might argue that he didn't consider her feelings or readiness, especially if they weren't discussing marriage yet. Proposing without prior conversation could be seen as moving too quickly, which he admits she told him. On the other hand, she agreed to marry him publicly but then changed her mind. That's a significant betrayal of trust and expectation. \n\nHe ended the relationship because of her insensitivity, but maybe he also contributed by not checking in with her before the proposal. However, her changing her answer after a public commitment is problematic. It's possible that both parties have some responsibility here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn the \"AITA\" format, the community often looks at whether both sides have valid points. If the man didn't consult her before proposing, that's a mistake. But her retraction after agreeing could be equally hurtful. The answer might be a mutual fault situation, but the options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). If the community leans towards the author having done something wrong by not discussing it, then A. If they see her as the main issue, then B. But since he ended the relationship over her actions, maybe the community would see her as the one at fault more. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. So if he didn't talk to her first, he's partially at fault. But maybe in the context, she's more to blame, so the answer might be B. Hmm. Need to decide based on societal norms. Proposals should be discussed beforehand. So A might be correct. But then again, she changed her mind after. It's a tough call. The answer could be A because he didn't check in, but maybe B because she's the one who retracted. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the community answers AITA as \"No,\" then the author isn't wrong. But traditionally, if someone plans a proposal without discussing, they might be seen as moving too fast. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, since she retracted her yes, maybe the author isn't wrong. I think the key point is that the author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which could be a mistake, making him at least partially at fault. So the answer might be A. But maybe the community sees it as mutual fault. Wait, the user's options are only A or B. If the answer is that the author is not in the wrong, then B. But I need to decide based on the analysis. Let me check similar AITA examples. Usually, if someone plans a surprise proposal without talking about it, they're often criticized for not being more communicative. So A would be the answer here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal first, making option A correct.\n"
