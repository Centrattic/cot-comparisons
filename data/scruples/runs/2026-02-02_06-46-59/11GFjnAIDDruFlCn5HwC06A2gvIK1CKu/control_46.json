      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a proposal gone wrong. The person set up a public proposal with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind. The author is asking if he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, the key points: He planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. She said yes initially but then didn't want to go through with the marriage. He ended the relationship because he felt she led him on and didn't communicate her feelings properly.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom his perspective, he followed through with a big commitment after she said yes, only to be rejected later. He might feel that she was insincere or didn't communicate her true feelings until it was too late. He might think that because she said yes, he had every right to proceed with the engagement, and her change of heart was a betrayal.\n\nFrom her side, she might have felt pressured by an unexpected public proposal. She mentioned moving too quickly and not being ready. Maybe she wasn't ready for marriage and the proposal caught her off guard, leading her to say yes in the moment but not meaning it. She could argue that he didn't give her a chance to express her feelings properly before making such a public commitment.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and expectations: Proposals are typically based on mutual agreement and readiness. If one person isn't ready, even if they initially say yes, the proposal should be based on a mutual understanding. However, the act of saying yes in a public proposal might be seen as a commitment that's hard to retract, but if the person wasn't truly ready, that's their own issue.\n\nThe author's mistake was not discussing the proposal and the engagement plans with her first. A proper engagement should involve a conversation where both parties are on the same page. By surprising her with a public proposal, he might have created a situation where she felt pressured to say yes in the moment, even if she wasn't entirely ready. This isn't necessarily manipulation, but it's a lack of communication.\n\nOn the other hand, she did say yes, even if later she changed her mind. The act of accepting a proposal is a commitment, but in reality, people can have moments of hesitation. However, once a proposal is accepted, it's generally expected that both parties are committed unless there's a clear reason not to proceed.\n\nSo, where's the fault here? If he didn't discuss the proposal with her first, he might have assumed she was ready when she wasn't. But she also didn't communicate her true feelings during the proposal. The public nature could have made her feel cornered, leading her to accept impulsively. However, after saying yes and going through the motions, her change of heart after the fact is problematic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some fault. He didn't check in with her about her readiness, and she didn't clarify her feelings before accepting. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. Since he didn't discuss the proposal first, which is a significant step, he shares some responsibility. However, the act of her changing her mind after saying yes is also an issue. But the main point of the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he didn't communicate his intention to propose and she wasn't ready, then he did make a mistake. However, the fact that she accepted and then retracted complicates it. \n\nIn many cases, proposals are based on mutual understanding, and if the proposal is public, the person might feel more pressure to accept. So, in that sense, he made a mistake by not having that conversation. But she also has responsibility for not being honest. \n\nThe answer would depend on cultural context and societal expectations. In some views, the proposer should always discuss the engagement first. Others might say that a proposal is a mutual decision made at the moment. \n\nGiven that, the author might be partially in the wrong for not discussing it first, leading her to feel pressured. So the answer could be A. However, there's also a case for B because she changed her mind after accepting. The question is about the author's fault. If the main issue is his failure to communicate his intentions, then A. But if her change of heart is the main issue, then B. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't talk to her about the proposal first, which is a common mistake. He assumed she was okay with proposing, but maybe she wasn't ready for that step yet. So he's at least partially to blame. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
