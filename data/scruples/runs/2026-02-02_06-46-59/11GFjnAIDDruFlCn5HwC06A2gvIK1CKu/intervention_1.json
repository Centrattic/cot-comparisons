I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal on a cruise, a \"yes\" followed by the girlfriend retracting her acceptance, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with his girlfriend first. She said yes but later changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insincere. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if that's accurate. Let's look at the key points. The author didn't discuss the proposal with his girlfriend beforehand, which she found problematic. She felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. By not discussing the engagement, he might have assumed she was open to marriage, which she wasn't. \n\nOn the other hand, after she said yes and then changed her mind, the author ended the relationship because he felt she led him on. She might feel she had a change of heart and didn't want to marry him, which is her right. However, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal could be seen as insincere if she wasn't truthful from the start. \n\nThe author's reaction is to end the relationship due to her insensitivity. But maybe he should have considered that she was also under pressure from the public proposal. She might have felt pressured to say yes in the moment and then realized she needed more time. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author didn't check in with her about marriage plans, leading to her feeling overwhelmed. She then retracted her acceptance, causing him emotional distress. Both made mistakes. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, which led to her feeling rushed, he might share the blame. But the user thinks he's in the wrong, so perhaps the answer is A. However, maybe she's equally at fault. The user is asking for my opinion based on the scenario. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's failure to discuss engagement plans could be a misstep. But once the proposal happened, her retraction was also a problem. The user's answer is A (author is in the wrong), but I need to decide if that's right. Alternatively, maybe both are at fault, but the question is binary. \n\nGiven the options, the user's initial thought is A, but I need to evaluate. The key is whether the author's actions led to the situation. By not discussing engagement, he might have contributed to her feeling unprepared. So, yes, he's in the wrong for not checking in. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
