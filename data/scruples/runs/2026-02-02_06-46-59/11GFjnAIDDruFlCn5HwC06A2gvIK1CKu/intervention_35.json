      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author proposed during a cruise, set up a big public event with photographer, and the girlfriend said yes. But then later she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are the public proposal setup, the initial yes, then retracting it, and the reasons each person gives. The author argues she led him on and didn't communicate her feelings. She says it's his fault for not discussing engagement first and moving too fast.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, proposing without discussing engagement could be seen as jumping into a commitment without ensuring both partners are on the same page. Maybe he should have talked to her about marriage first instead of setting up a surprise proposal. On the other hand, she said yes in the moment but then changed her mind. That's a big emotional letdown for him. She might not have considered the impact of her initial yes followed by a change of heart. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider cultural norms. In some cultures, a surprise proposal is common, but if the relationship isn't stable enough to discuss such a big step, maybe it's premature. Also, she did say yes, which is a commitment, even if temporary. Retracting it after causing emotional distress could be seen as insensitivity as well. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. But if he didn't communicate his intentions beforehand, that could contribute to the problem. It's a mutual issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. His action of ending the relationship because of her retraction might be justified if he felt betrayed, but maybe he should have handled it differently. \n\nAlternatively, if she truly wasn't ready and communicated that later, maybe breaking up is the right call. The problem is whether he was wrong to not discuss engagement first. So, if he didn't check in with her about marriage plans, that's where the fault lies. But if he thought she was ready and she wasn't, it's a misunderstanding. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might share some responsibility for not discussing the proposal first, but the girlfriend retracting her yes after causing emotional harm is also an issue. However, since the question is about the author's fault, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't have that conversation beforehand. But if the user thinks he's correct, maybe B (not in the wrong) because she retracted her commitment. Hmm. This is tricky. I need to decide based on the key factors.\n"
