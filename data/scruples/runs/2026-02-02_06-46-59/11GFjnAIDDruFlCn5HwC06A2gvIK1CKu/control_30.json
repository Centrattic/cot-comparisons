We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault here. The situation is about a proposal that got rejected after the initial \"yes\". The author proposed on a cruise, set up a public event with a photographer, and the girlfriend said yes but later changed her mind. The author is upset that she didn't really mean the \"yes\" and ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author did plan a public proposal without discussing it with her first. That might be a point against him. Some people might think that a proposal is a big commitment and should be discussed beforehand. But then again, proposing is a common way to ask for a future, and maybe she expected a more private setting. However, the main issue here is her changing her mind after saying \"yes\".\n\nThe girlfriend says she wasn't ready and they were moving too fast. She might feel that the public proposal pressured her into an immediate decision she wasn't comfortable with. On the other hand, the author felt betrayed and led on, leading him to end the relationship. The key here is communication. If she didn't want to get married, why say yes in the first place? That could be seen as insensitivity, as the author was emotionally invested and then let down.\n\nBut also, the author didn't talk to her about an engagement before the proposal. Maybe she felt that the public proposal was too sudden. So, both sides have some fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is the one at fault.\n\nIf the author didn't discuss the engagement with her before the proposal, he might have contributed to the problem by not checking in with her readiness. However, the girlfriend's retraction after the initial \"yes\" is also a problem because that's a significant betrayal of trust. The author's decision to end the relationship because of that could be justified if he felt he couldn't move past the hurt. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the user wants a choice between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the scenario, the author did make a public proposal without prior discussion, which could be a mistake. However, the girlfriend's actions were also problematic. Since the author ended the relationship, the question is whether he's in the wrong for ending it. If the main fault lies with the girlfriend for retracting the \"yes\", then the answer would be B. But if the author's approach was flawed by not discussing it first, then A. But the main issue here is the retraction, so maybe B is the better answer because the girlfriend's actions were more harmful. The author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as a valid response to betrayal, not necessarily wrong.\n"
