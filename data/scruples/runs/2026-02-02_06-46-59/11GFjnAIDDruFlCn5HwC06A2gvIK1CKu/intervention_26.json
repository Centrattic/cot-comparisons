      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author proposed during a cruise with a public setup, the girlfriend said yes initially but later changed her mind, leading to the breakup. The user thinks the author is at fault, but wants to know my perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing the engagement first. The girlfriend felt they were moving too quickly and wasn't ready. She changed her mind after initially saying yes. The author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive.\n\nIn many relationships, communication is key. Proposing in a public setting without prior discussions about marriage could be seen as rushing things. The girlfriend might not have been ready for such a commitment, and her change of heart, while painful, might indicate that she wasn't fully committed at the time. However, retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal is also a big deal and can be hurtful. \n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship immediately. That might be harsh, but if he felt betrayed, it's understandable. The girlfriend's insensitivity could be in leading him on, but the author's approach might have contributed by not checking in with her before the proposal. \n\nSo, both parties might share some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't discuss the engagement first, that's a mistake. However, the girlfriend's retraction after saying yes is also a problem. The user thinks the author is at fault, but I need to decide based on the situation. \n\nConsidering the key points: the lack of prior discussion about marriage by the author and the girlfriend's retraction. Maybe the author is partially at fault for not ensuring mutual readiness. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because the girlfriend's actions also contributed. However, since the question is about the author's fault, the main issue is the public proposal without discussing engagement, which the girlfriend mentioned as her reason. So, A might be the answer here.\n"
