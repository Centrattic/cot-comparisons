      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The guy planned a public proposal on a cruise, got a yes, then later found out the girl didn't really want to marry him. He says she led him on and ended up breaking up with her because of her insensitivity. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal without discussing it with her first. His girlfriend (now ex) says that they were moving too quickly and she wasn't ready. She might have felt pressured by the public proposal. Public proposals can be a big deal, and maybe she felt it was rushed. The author says he was elated when she said yes, but then she changed her mind. He felt she led him on, but she says it was his fault for not talking about the engagement first.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. The key points are: did the author act inconsiderately by not discussing the proposal with her first? Public proposals can be traditional, but maybe in some relationships, discussing such a big step beforehand is necessary. If the author didn't talk about marriage plans, maybe he assumed she was on the same page. However, the ex says she wasn't ready, so maybe the author didn't communicate properly. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl changed her mind after saying yes. That's a big shift. The author was hurt and ended the relationship. Is the girl in the wrong for changing her mind, or is she justified in needing time? People can change their minds, especially under pressure. \n\nSo, considering that the author didn't discuss the proposal with her first, which might have led her to not be prepared for the commitment, he could be at fault. But she also changed her mind after accepting, which complicates things. The answer might be that both have some responsibility, but the question is about the author specifically. If the main issue is that he didn't talk about it first, then he could be in the wrong. If the main issue is her changing her mind, then maybe not. But the user's question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the ex pointed out the proposal was planned without discussion, leading to pressure, the author's action might be the root cause. So maybe he's in the wrong (A), but I'm a bit torn because the girl also changed her mind. But the question is about the author's responsibility here.\n"
