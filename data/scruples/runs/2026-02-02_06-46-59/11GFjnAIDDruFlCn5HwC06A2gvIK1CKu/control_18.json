      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong after their girlfriend took back her \"yes\" to the proposal.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author proposed on a cruise, set up a big public moment with a photographer, she said yes. Then later, she changed her mind, didn't want to marry him. He got upset, ended the relationship, and is now asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Well, the core issue seems to be about communication and expectations. The author is upset because she changed her mind after accepting the proposal. The girlfriend is saying that the proposal was too sudden, done without discussing the engagement first, and that they were moving too fast.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he was excited and made a big gesture, expecting a commitment. The girlfriend says she wasn't ready and didn't have time to process. The author feels betrayed because she didn't communicate her true feelings before the proposal. The girlfriend feels the proposal was rushed and he didn't talk it over with her.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. Proposing is a major commitment. The author might have thought that asking was the right step, but if they hadn't discussed engagement plans before, that could be a problem. The girlfriend might feel pressured because the proposal was a surprise, maybe she wasn't ready to make that decision in that moment, even if she said yes initially.\n\nThe author ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitive. But maybe his reaction is also a bit extreme? If she genuinely changed her mind after saying yes, that's hurtful, but maybe there were underlying issues they hadn't discussed. The girlfriend's reasoning is that they moved too fast, which is a valid concern in relationships. Proposing without discussing the engagement first could be seen as a misstep.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of both. The girlfriend did say yes and then changed her mind, which is tough, but the author also didn't talk about the engagement plans with her before proposing, leading to her not being ready. Both could be at fault here. However, the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend said yes and then took it back, which is a significant issue, but the author's approach might have contributed by not discussing it beforehand. In many cases, people expect to talk about engagement before a proposal. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not having that conversation, but the girlfriend's change of heart is also problematic. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, meaning yes, the author is in the wrong, or B, no. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because while he could have discussed it more, the main issue here is her changing her mind after saying yes. The girlfriend's actions are more clearly at fault. The author's mistake was not talking it over, but the major betrayal is her taking back her yes. So the author isn't in the wrong; the girlfriend's actions are the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
