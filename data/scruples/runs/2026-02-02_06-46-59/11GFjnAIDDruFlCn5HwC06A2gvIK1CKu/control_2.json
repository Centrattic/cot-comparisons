      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy proposed during a cruise, planned a public proposal with a photographer, and the girl said yes. But then later, she changed her mind and didn't want to marry him. The guy was really upset, cried, and broke things off because he thought she was insensitively leading him on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy planned a big proposal without discussing it with her first. That might come off as moving too quickly, especially if he didn't talk about engagement or marriage before doing it. The girl said she wasn't ready and that he was moving too fast. She might have felt pressured by the public proposal setup, which could have made her feel like there was no time to think about it properly. So, maybe she didn't have a chance to process her feelings yet.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy had the right to feel hopeful when she said yes. Proposing is a significant step, and expecting an answer that's not later rescinded is understandable. The girl's change of heart after saying yes could be seen as leading him on, especially if she didn't communicate her hesitation sooner. However, maybe she was just as shocked by her own yes as he was and realized it wasn't the right decision. That could be a case of not being ready for marriage, not necessarily insensitivity.\n\nThe guy ended the relationship because he felt she was insensitively leading him on. But if he didn't talk to her about his proposal plans beforehand, perhaps he didn't consider her readiness for such a public and binding commitment. The public proposal might have made her feel cornered, leading her to say yes and then regret it. In that case, the guy's approach might have contributed to the situation.\n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong for not discussing the proposal with her first. However, the girl's reaction of changing her mind after saying yes definitely caused pain. It's a tricky situation where both parties contributed. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girl's main issue was that he moved too quickly without discussing it, then the author's mistake was not talking about the proposal beforehand. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, yes, he's in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure because the girl's actions also played a role. However, according to the rules, I have to pick A or B. Given that he didn't discuss the proposal plans with her, which might have been a big assumption, he could be at fault. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
