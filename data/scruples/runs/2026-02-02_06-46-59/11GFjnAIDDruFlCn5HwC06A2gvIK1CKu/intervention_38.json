      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a proposal on a cruise that was planned without prior discussion, leading to the girlfriend agreeing but then changing her mind, resulting in a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author proposed in a public, planned way with a photographer. The girlfriend initially said yes, then changed her mind. She blamed the author for moving too quickly without discussing an engagement first. The author ended the relationship due to her insensitivity.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author's actions: planning a big proposal without discussing it with his partner. That could be seen as presumptuous, not respecting her need for communication. The girlfriend's response: she changed her mind after accepting, which is hard, but she claims she wasn't ready and the proposal was too rushed. She was upset about the public nature of it and not discussing the engagement first.\n\nSo, the author didn't consult with his partner before proposing, which might have led to her feeling pressured. Even though the proposal was a surprise, it's possible he didn't give her a chance to express her feelings beforehand. His reaction was to end the relationship, which could be a valid choice, but maybe he didn't handle it the best way.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes, which is hurtful. The author's frustration is understandable. But the root cause might be his lack of communication before the proposal. If they hadn't discussed the engagement, maybe he should have realized she wasn't ready. So, is the author in the wrong for not discussing it first, making her have to say yes in the moment and then back out? Or is the girlfriend in the wrong for changing her mind after accepting?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Planning a proposal without talking about it first could be a misstep. The girlfriend's reason for not wanting to marry him might be valid if they weren't discussing the future enough. The author's anger at her insensitivity makes sense, but maybe he contributed by not initiating those conversations. The girlfriend's reaction to the public proposal might indicate she wasn't comfortable with that method, which could have been a red flag. \n\nSo, considering all factors, maybe the author did have some fault in not discussing the proposal first. However, the girlfriend's actions of changing her mind after accepting is also a problem. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the main point is his decision to propose without prior discussion. If the girlfriend wasn't ready, then he might have pushed too fast without checking in with her. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate enough before the proposal, leading to her confusion or pressure to say yes.\n"
