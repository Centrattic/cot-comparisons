I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this. AITA or is she?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out who's at fault here. The user proposed to his girlfriend during a cruise, set it all up with a photographer, and she said yes. But then later she changed her mind. He's upset and ended the relationship, thinking she's insensitive. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the proposal was a big moment. He planned it without discussing it with her first. She might have felt pressured. Even if she said yes, maybe she wasn't ready. The user didn't talk about marriage with her before the proposal. That's a key point. Proposing without having the conversation could be seen as moving too quickly.\n\nShe said she didn't want to marry him, which is her right. But she led him on? Well, she did say yes, but maybe she was just reacting in the moment. People can say things in the heat of the moment. But then she changed her mind. He felt betrayed because she didn't clarify before the proposal.\n\nThe user ended the relationship, which is his choice. But was it his fault for not discussing it first? Maybe he's responsible for assuming she was ready. She might have been honest if he had talked about it. So, maybe the user is at fault for not having that conversation. But he's also hurt. It's a tough call.\n\nOn the other hand, she agreed to the proposal but then backed out. That's confusing. But maybe she wasn't ready. The user's actions led to a situation where she felt cornered. So, maybe both are partly at fault. But the question is whether the author (the user) is in the wrong. If he didn't discuss the engagement first, that could be his mistake. So, answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No)?\n\nHmm. The user's actions led to the problem. He didn't communicate, so he's partially at fault. But she also didn't communicate her feelings. However, the question is from the user's perspective, asking if he's in the wrong. The answer might be that he is in the wrong for not discussing it first, making answer A. But others might say she's at fault for changing her mind. It's a bit blurry. Probably, the user is at least partially in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
