I set it up at the end of a show with a photographer and everything and popped the question and she said yes! I was so elated, on cloud nine, it was like a dream. We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me\u2014 she didn\u2019t want to actually marry me.\n\nI was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn\u2019t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree. I ended our relationship right then because I can\u2019t overlook such insensitivity like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a proposal that went wrong. The author set up a public proposal, the girlfriend said yes but then changed her mind later. The author ended the relationship, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a public proposal, which could be seen as putting pressure on the relationship. Maybe he didn't discuss the engagement plans beforehand, which the girlfriend points out. She might have felt that moving too quickly wasn't right for her. On the other hand, the author felt led on and ended the relationship because of her change of heart.\n\nPublic proposals can be a big deal. Some people might see it as a romantic gesture, but others might view it as presumptuous if not discussed earlier. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she wasn't ready for marriage, and the author didn't talk it over with her first. That's a key point. If they hadn't discussed the future, maybe the author should have been more considerate of her feelings.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend changed her mind after saying yes. That could be hurtful too. She might have had a change of heart, but retracting a \"yes\" after a proposal can be really painful for the proposer. The author's reaction is understandable, but was it right to end the relationship immediately?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh the arguments. The author didn't discuss the proposal with her, which could have been a mistake. However, the girlfriend's decision to take back her acceptance is also a major issue. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had talked about the proposal and engagement before the public event, maybe they could have aligned their expectations. The girlfriend's insensitivity in changing her mind might be valid if the author hadn't discussed it first, but it's also her responsibility to be honest about her feelings.\n\nThis is a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on proposals. Some might say the author should have talked first, others might say the girlfriend should have been clear from the start. Since the user is asking for an opinion, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Considering the setup without prior discussion, maybe A (Yes) is the answer. But the girlfriend's actions also contributed.\n"
