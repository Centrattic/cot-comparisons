      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after his girlfriend (now ex) took back her \"yes\" during a proposal. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author set up a public proposal with a photographer on a cruise, and she initially said yes. They celebrated with champagne and pictures, but later she changed her mind, saying she didn't actually want to marry him. The author feels hurt and ended the relationship, blaming her for insensitivity. She, on the other hand, claims it was his fault for not discussing the proposal first and moving too quickly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the proposal was a surprise, done in a public setting without prior discussion. The girlfriend was caught off guard and wasn't ready. The author is upset because she didn't stick to her initial \"yes,\" while she's upset because he didn't talk to her about the proposal first. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. I need to consider social norms and expectations around engagements. Typically, proposals are big life decisions, and while they can be a surprise, it's generally advisable to have some discussion first to ensure both partners are on the same page. The author's approach might have been too abrupt, especially if they weren't already discussing marriage plans. By surprising her, he might have made her feel pressured, leading her to say yes in the moment but later realize she wasn't ready.\n\nOn the other hand, once she said yes, retracting it can be seen as insensitivity because it causes emotional harm. However, the root of the problem might lie in the lack of prior communication. The author didn't check in with her about their future plans before the proposal, which could have prevented the misunderstanding. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be justified if they hadn't discussed marriage before, making the proposal a shock. But retracting the \"yes\" after the proposal is a major issue. However, the author's failure to have that conversation first is a significant factor here. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, both parties have some responsibility. The author didn't communicate his intentions, and the girlfriend didn't clarify her feelings before the proposal. But since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the main point is whether his actions were at fault. By not discussing an engagement before proposing, he might have jumped into a decision without ensuring mutual readiness. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in some part wrong for not having that discussion first. So, the answer would be A, but maybe with the nuance that both are at fault. However, the user's options are A or B, so based on the analysis, A (the author is in the wrong) is the choice.\n"
