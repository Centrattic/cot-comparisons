      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that he proposed on a cruise, she said yes, then later changed her mind. He was really upset and ended the relationship, and now he's asking if he's the at-fault one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The man planned a public proposal, which the woman later says was moving too quickly. She didn't want to get married, but she said yes at the time. The man feels she led him on, and she's upset because he didn't talk about engagement first. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the man is wrong for setting up a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. The woman's argument is that he moved too fast, and she wasn't ready. The man counters that she should have been honest earlier instead of leading him on. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. Proposing is a significant step, and while some people might plan it without prior discussion, others might feel blindsided. The man's action could be seen as a lack of communication, especially if they hadn't discussed marriage before. However, the woman's response after saying yes might also be problematic because once she said yes, changing her mind could be seen as insincere, but maybe she was under the influence of the moment's emotion.\n\nOn the other hand, if they hadn't had the talk about marriage, the public proposal might have been a shock, leading her to not mean her \"yes\" at that moment. But once she said yes, retracting it after celebrations might be hard on the proposer. \n\nThe man ended the relationship because of her insensitivity. Is he right to do so? If she changed her mind after saying yes, that could be hurtful. However, if the proposal was sprung without discussion, maybe he's at fault for not checking in. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: The man didn't discuss marriage plans first, which could have led to her feeling pressured. But her retracting her consent after the proposal is also hurtful. However, in many cultures, a proposal is a mutual decision, and retracting it afterward is still a valid choice, though painful. \n\nThe man might be in the right to feel hurt and end the relationship, but perhaps his lack of prior communication contributed. However, the woman's change of heart might not make him entirely at fault. The answer might be B (No), because while he could have discussed it before, her retracting after the proposal is also a significant issue, but the main fault isn't entirely his. However, some might argue that he should have had the conversation before proposing, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The woman's actions are more harmful here, leading to him ending the relationship. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
