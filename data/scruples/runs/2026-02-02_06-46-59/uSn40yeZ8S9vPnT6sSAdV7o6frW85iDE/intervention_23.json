My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay for $45. The sister then left for college and they haven't spoken since. The author later apologized, but there's a review issue with the buyer.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author was selling the cough drops and the sister ate them without knowing their value. The author got angry and yelled, leading to a rift. The sister's perspective is that it was over some regular cough drops, not realizing their worth. The author then went to apologize, so they took responsibility, but the question is about whether they were in the wrong initially.\n\nSo, the main factors here are: Did the author overreact? The cough drops were valuable to the author, but the sister didn't know that. Yelling at her for something she didn't intend to do could be considered harsh. The author made a profit, but the sister's mistake was honest. The author's reaction caused a significant consequence (the sister left, no contact for a month). The fact that the author later went to apologize and resolved it by not making her pay suggests they realized their mistake. However, the initial reaction\u2014yelling\u2014might be excessive given the sister's lack of intent. So, even though the item was valuable, the emotional response might be the author's fault here. The sister made an honest mistake, so the author's reaction of yelling could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
