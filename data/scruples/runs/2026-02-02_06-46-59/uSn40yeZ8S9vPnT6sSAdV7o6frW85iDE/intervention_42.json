My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author selling cough drops on eBay for $45 and then their sister ate them. The author got really upset, yelled at her, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author is feeling bad about it and even went to apologize.\n\nFirst, the main point is the value of the cough drops. The author sold them for $45, which seems pretty high for cough drops. That's the part that's causing the conflict. The sister probably didn't know they were valuable since she just ate them. If she knew they were worth $45, would she have eaten them? Maybe not. But she didn't know, so it's an honest mistake.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which is understandable if you're frustrated, but maybe over the top for the situation. The sister was just being careless, not malicious. The author could have been upset about losing the profit, but yelling might have made things worse. The sister left and didn't communicate, so the author took responsibility by apologizing, which is good.\n\nIn the edits, the author mentions they're going to the sister's college to apologize and not making her pay, which shows they realize they might have overreacted. Also, the buyer gave a 3-star review, which is a consequence but maybe the buyer understood.\n\nSo, the key points are: sister didn't know the value, author overreacted, but took steps to fix the relationship. The author probably felt wronged because of the money, but the sister's mistake was innocent. The author is partly in the wrong for the harsh reaction, even if the sister made a mistake. The value of the item is subjective, but handling the situation with yelling isn't the best approach. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because their reaction was excessive given the sister's lack of intent.\n"
