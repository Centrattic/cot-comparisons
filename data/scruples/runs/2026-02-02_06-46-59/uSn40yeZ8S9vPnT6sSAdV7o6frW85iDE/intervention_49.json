My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is upset because their sister ate cough drops they were selling on eBay for $45, resulting in a $35 profit. They confronted the sister, yelled at her, and now she hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized but still laid down ground rules.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a valuable item that was accidentally consumed. The sister didn't know the cough drops were being sold, which seems like an honest mistake. The author was upset about losing money, but yelling in a harsh manner might have been excessive. Money can't be eaten, but relationships can, and the author's reaction led to a rift. \n\nHowever, the author did take steps to make amends by apologizing and driving to the sister's college. They also didn't make the sister pay, acknowledging the mistake was honest. The buyer gave a 3-star review, which is a consequence but maybe manageable. \n\nOn one hand, the sister's action was unintentional, and the author's emotional response might have been too strong. On the other, the author was justified in feeling upset about the loss of income. But yelling and causing a breakdown in communication seems unwise. The resolution steps show the author tried to fix things, which is positive. \n\nSo, while the sister's mistake was honest, the author's reaction was probably over the top given the context. The value of $35 versus the sister's relationship and emotional impact should be considered. The key is whether the response was disproportionate. Yelling and causing a long silence might be in the wrong. But since the author did apologize and make amends, maybe not entirely? But the initial reaction is what's causing the problem. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they overreacted to an honest mistake. The sister didn't know the drops were for sale, and yelling led to further issues. The author should've handled it with more understanding first. Answer A.\n"
