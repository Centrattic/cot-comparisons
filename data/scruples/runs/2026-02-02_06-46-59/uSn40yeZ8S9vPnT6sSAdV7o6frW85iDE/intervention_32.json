My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were planning to sell for $45. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later went to apologize but also set some ground rules.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author sells items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45. They couldn't find the item and found out the sister ate them. The author yelled at her, which caused the sister to leave. Then the author apologized but got a 3-star review from the buyer after explaining the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't know the value of the cough drops. The author made a profit of $35, which isn't a huge amount, but it's their business. The sister ate them by mistake, not with malicious intent. The author's reaction was yelling, which is pretty harsh. The sister was probably shocked and felt attacked, leading her to leave. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay, which is good, but the initial reaction was over the top. The buyer gave a bad review because the item wasn't delivered, which could affect the author's eBay reputation. \n\nThe author's mistake was in the way they handled the situation. They could have been more understanding since it was an honest mistake. The sister might not have known the item was valuable. Yelling and causing a rift over $35 seems excessive. The author's actions led to a loss of a relationship and a bad review. Even though they made amends by apologizing, the initial reaction was the problem. So the answer is yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
