My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay for $45. The sister then went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later drives down to apologize and explains the situation to the buyer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was selling items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops. They didn't find the item in their closet and eventually found out their sister ate them. The author yelled at the sister, leading to a rift. Then, they apologize and drive to her college, and also contact the buyer. The sister's perspective was that the author was being mean over cough drops, not realizing their value.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. \n\nLet me think about the factors. The author was upset about losing $35 profit, which is a significant amount for cough drops. The sister didn't know about the auction and ate them, thinking they were regular cough drops. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive. The author's actions led to the sister leaving, and the author later apologized. \n\nI should consider the sister's perspective. If she didn't know the value of the item, then the author's reaction might have been disproportionate. The author could have been more understanding and explained the situation instead of yelling. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and making an effort to fix things.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a position where they had a financial loss due to the sister's mistake. But the way they handled it\u2014yelling\u2014could have been avoided with better communication. The sister might not have intended to cause harm, so the author's reaction of yelling seems harsh. \n\nAdditionally, the author later took steps to make amends, which is a positive sign. But the initial reaction is what's in question here. The key here is whether the author's anger was justified. Since it was an honest mistake, yelling might be considered overreacting. The sister's actions weren't malicious, so the author's response could be seen as inconsiderate of her perspective.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's mistake was in losing their temper and yelling. The sister's action was accidental, and the author could have handled it more calmly. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
