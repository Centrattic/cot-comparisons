My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay, which ended up being worth $45. The author feels bad and the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author later went to apologize and didn't make the sister pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was selling the cough drops for a profit. That's their property, right? So if someone else uses their property without permission, especially for something like eating them when they were meant to be sold, that's a problem. The author probably felt wronged because they lost money. But the sister didn't know the value of the item. Maybe she didn't realize they were for sale and not just regular cough drops. The author didn't mention if the sister was aware of the eBay auction or the value. That might be a key point.\n\nThe author yelled at her, which could be seen as an overreaction. Even if the sister made a mistake, yelling might not be the best response. The author made a profit of $35, but the sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable. So the sister's mistake was honest. The author could have been more understanding. But the sister eating the cough drops wasn't intentional theft. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to be upset about losing something they were selling. However, the emotional response of yelling and causing a rift might have been excessive. The author later took steps to make amends, which is good, but the initial reaction was harsh. \n\nI think the sister's mistake was honest, and the author's response was proportionate in terms of feeling upset, but yelling might have been unnecessary. The author could have handled it more calmly. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong for overreacting. But since it's a family situation, emotions can run high. Still, the sister didn't intend to cause harm, so the author's anger might be unjustified. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because their reaction was overly harsh given the sister's innocent mistake.\n"
