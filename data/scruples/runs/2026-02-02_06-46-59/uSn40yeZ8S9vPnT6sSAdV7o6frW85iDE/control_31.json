My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops, which they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author now feels bad and went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author was selling the cough drops, which they bought and sold on eBay. They made $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value, maybe because she didn't notice the brand (like the Supreme logo, as the title mentions). The author confronted her and yelled, which led to the sister leaving.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't know the value of the item. The author could have handled it without yelling, especially over $35. They made a profit, but the emotional impact on the sister was bigger. The author realized this and took steps to fix it by apologizing and not making the sister pay. So, while the sister made a mistake, the author's reaction was harsh. Yelling and causing a rift over money that wasn't critical might be excessive. The resolution they took (apologizing, not making her pay) suggests they see their mistake in handling it. So the author is partly at fault for overreacting. So answer A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
