My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author sells items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that. The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and reaction. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable. She ate them because she liked the taste. The author was selling them, so the item's value was important for their business. But the sister's mistake was honest. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which seems harsh for an honest mistake. Even though the item was valuable to them, the sister had no way of knowing. The author's anger led to a breakdown in their relationship. However, the author did apologize and take responsibility, which is a positive step. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had the right to be upset about losing the item they were selling, but their reaction was excessive given the sister's lack of intent to harm. The author should have handled it calmly, explained the situation, and maybe asked for a replacement rather than yelling. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister's actions, while careless, weren't malicious. The author's business was affected, but the monetary loss seems minimal compared to the emotional damage caused by yelling. So, the author's overreaction is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their response was disproportionate to the sister's mistake.\n"
