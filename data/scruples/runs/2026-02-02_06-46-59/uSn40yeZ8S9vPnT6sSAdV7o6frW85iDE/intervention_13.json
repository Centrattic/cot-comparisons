My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author sells items on eBay, and this particular cough drop sold for $45. They lost the item and found it in their sister's room, who had eaten them. The author yelled, and now the sister isn't talking to them. The author later apologized and drove to her college, but the sister felt it was overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made a profit of $35 from the sale. The sister didn't know the item was valuable, just ate them because she liked the taste. The author's reaction was yelling, which caused a rift. The author then took steps to make amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, yelling at a sister over something that she didn't know was valuable could be seen as overreacting. The sister might not have intended to cause harm. The author was in a situation where they had a financial loss, but the sister's mistake was honest. The author's initial reaction was emotional, but they did apologize and take responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's mistake was in the immediate reaction of yelling, which escalated the issue. However, they did make amends. The sister's perspective is important here; she felt it was a normal item, so the author's knowledge of its value versus the sister's lack of knowledge plays a role. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had a legitimate reason to be upset about losing a sale that made them profit. But the way they handled it was harsh. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, but their subsequent actions show they realized the mistake. However, the question is whether they were wrong. The sister's honest mistake and the author's emotional response make it so that the author did have some fault in how they handled the situation. The fact that they apologized and tried to fix things shows they saw their error. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
