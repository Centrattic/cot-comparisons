My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the author sells designer stuff on eBay. They had an auction for Supreme cough drops that ended up at $45, making a $35 profit. Later, they couldn't find the item and discovered their sister ate them. He yelled at her, and she went back to college, not talking to him since. The author felt bad and later apologized, but the sister didn't know the value of the item.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about ownership and communication. The author owned the cough drops, right? They were part of their eBay business. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author was upset about losing money, but maybe they overreacted by yelling. The sister's perspective is that she didn't know they were valuable. The author later apologized, which is a good step.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't know they were for sale, so maybe the author didn't communicate that clearly. If the cough drops were in a shared space, maybe the author should have kept them more secure. Yelling over a $35 loss might be excessive, especially causing a family rift. But the author did take responsibility and apologized. So maybe the wrong here is partly on the author for not explaining the item's value and for overreacting, but the sister also made a mistake by eating someone else's property. However, since she didn't know, it's an honest mistake. The author's reaction caused a bigger issue. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they overreacted and didn't communicate the item's importance earlier. The sister's mistake was honest, and yelling led to more damage than necessary.\n"
