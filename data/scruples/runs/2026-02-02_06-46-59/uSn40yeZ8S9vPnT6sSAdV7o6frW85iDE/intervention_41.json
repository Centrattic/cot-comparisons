My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were sold for $45 on eBay. The sister then went back to college and hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the facts. The author sold the cough drops for $45, making a $35 profit. They couldn't find them and eventually found out the sister ate them. The author yelled at her, leading to a strained relationship. The sister's reason was just liking the taste, which seems like an innocent mistake. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay, but the sister's perspective was that it was over a normal cough drop, not realizing their value.\n\nConsidering the actions: yelling over a $35 profit seems excessive. The sister didn't know the value of the item, so it was an honest mistake. The author's reaction was harsh, leading to the sister leaving and the relationship issue. However, the author did take steps to fix it by apologizing and making amends. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the overreaction to a mistake and not considering the sister's lack of awareness. Even though they made amends, the initial reaction was inappropriate. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted and didn't handle the situation calmly, leading to unnecessary harm in their relationship.\n"
