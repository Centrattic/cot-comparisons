My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops that the author was selling on eBay, leading to a fallout where the sister left and hasn't spoken since. The author later apologized and went to her college to make amends.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction: yelling at the sister for eating something that was intended to be sold. The cough drops were part of their eBay business, which generated a $35 profit. The sister didn't realize the value or that they were for sale. The author's anger seems to stem from both the financial loss and the fact that the sister didn't respect the item's purpose. However, yelling and causing a rift over this, especially leading to the sister leaving without talking for a month, suggests that the reaction was excessive relative to the situation.\n\nThe key points here are: Was the author's anger justified? The sister made a mistake, but it was honest. The author's business was affected, but the amount in question is $35 profit. The emotional impact on the sister was significant, leading her to leave. The author later apologized and tried to fix things, which shows they recognized the issue. However, the initial reaction of yelling seems disproportionate. The sister didn't act maliciously, just made an error in judgment. The author's response damaged their relationship, which is more important than the monetary value. Therefore, the author was in the wrong for overreacting, even though the sister was at fault for not knowing the item's value. The right approach would have been to express disappointment and explain the situation calmly, not yell.\n"
