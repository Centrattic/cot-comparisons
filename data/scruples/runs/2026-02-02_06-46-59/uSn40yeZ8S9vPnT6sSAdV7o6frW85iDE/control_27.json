My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author was selling Supreme cough drops on eBay for $45, making a $35 profit. They couldn't find them and later discovered their sister had eaten them. He yelled at her, leading to her leaving and not talking to him since. Now he's feeling bad and plans to apologize.\n\nHmm. First, was the cough drop valuable? It was a Supreme brand, sold on eBay for $45, so that's not just a normal $3 or $5 item. It's a collectible or something with a high price. So the author likely put effort into acquiring it for resale. The sister didn't know the value or the brand, which is mentioned in the edit. That's a key point. If she didn't know they were valuable, maybe she didn't realize the mistake.\n\nBut the author's reaction was yelling and being harsh. The sister was eating them because she liked the taste, not knowing their worth. The author could have been more understanding initially, especially since it's a family member. The emotional response of yelling might have been disproportionate to the situation, even if the item was expensive. The sister's reaction of leaving and not talking since shows it was a big deal for her. The author later apologized, which is good, but the initial reaction might have been excessive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister might have not known the value, so maybe the author should have explained the situation calmly first instead of yelling. Family conflicts can be tricky, and handling it with anger might have worsened things. The author's main mistake was the yelling and not addressing the situation calmly, even if the item was valuable. The sister's actions were a mistake, but the author's response was harsh. So, in terms of being in the wrong, the author probably is, because their reaction was excessive and led to a broken relationship. They took responsibility later, but the initial reaction is where the fault lies.\n"
