My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. Let me look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author sells designer items on eBay and had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45. They made a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item and discovered their sister ate them. The author confronted her, yelled, and now the sister is upset and left for college. The author feels bad and later apologized.\n\nSo, key points: The cough drops were part of a business transaction, which adds value beyond just being candy. The sister didn't realize their value or the context of the auction. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given the sister's lack of knowledge about the item's significance.\n\nThe sister's perspective is important here. She ate them because she liked the taste, not knowing they were valuable. The author, however, saw them as part of a sale and lost money because of her actions. But the emotional response of yelling seems harsh for an honest mistake, especially since it caused a rift. The author later apologized, which shows they realized their reaction was too strong. \n\nThe fact that the sister didn't know about the auction or the brand (Supreme) suggests it was an innocent mistake. The author's business practices might be a bit unusual, but that's their choice. However, the way they handled the situation\u2014yelling and causing a break in contact\u2014was probably disproportionate. The author taking responsibility by apologizing is a good step, but initially, their reaction was inconsiderate of the sister's perspective.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they overreacted. The answer should be A.\n"
