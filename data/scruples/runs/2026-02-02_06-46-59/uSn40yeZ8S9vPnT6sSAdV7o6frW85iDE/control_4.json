My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and drove to her college to make amends.\n\nFirst, the author made a profit of $35 from the cough drops. But the sister ate them without knowing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and that caused a rift. The key points here are whether the author overreacted. Yelling over a $35 profit might seem excessive, especially since the sister didn't know they were valuable. The author later apologized, which shows they realized their mistake. The sister's perspective was that it was just normal cough drops, so the author's reaction was out of proportion to her understanding. The author didn't make the sister pay because it was an honest mistake. So, while the sister was wrong to take the item intended for sale, the author's emotional response was the bigger issue here. The fact that they took responsibility and apologized suggests they were in the wrong initially. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
