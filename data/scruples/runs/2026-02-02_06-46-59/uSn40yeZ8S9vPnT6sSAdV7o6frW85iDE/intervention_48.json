My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister eating cough drops that they sold for $45, leading to an argument and the sister leaving. The author feels bad and later apologizes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author sells items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that. The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author yelled, which caused the sister to go back to college. Then the author went to apologize but set ground rules and didn't make the sister pay for them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the sister made a mistake by eating something valuable without knowing. The author had a right to be upset, but yelling and overreacting might have been excessive. The author later apologized, which shows they realized their mistake. However, the initial reaction of yelling was harsh, especially over something the sister didn't intend to do. The fact that the author made a profit of $35 might seem trivial compared to the emotional damage caused. The sister didn't know the item's value, so the author should have handled it more calmly. The author's decision to apologize and not make the sister pay suggests they acknowledged their fault. So, maybe the author was in the wrong for overreacting, even if the sister was at fault initially. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
