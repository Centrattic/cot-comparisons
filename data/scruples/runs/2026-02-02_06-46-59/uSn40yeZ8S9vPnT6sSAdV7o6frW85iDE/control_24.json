My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author sold cough drops for $45 on eBay, made a $35 profit. They couldn't find the item until they saw their sister ate them. Then they yelled at her, sister left, and they felt bad later, went to apologize and drive down to her college.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: yelling at their sister for eating something that was valuable to them. The sister didn't know the value, just liked the taste. The author might have overreacted. The sister went back to college and didn't talk to them since. Then the author went to apologize, which is good, but the initial reaction was yelling.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were upset about losing $35 profit. But yelling at their sister over an honest mistake might be disproportionate. The sister didn't know the item was valuable, so maybe the author should have been more understanding. Also, the author took responsibility later by apologizing, which shows they realize the mistake. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they yelled over an honest mistake, but then they made things right. But the question is just about being in the wrong initially. The sister didn't mean harm, so the author's reaction was too harsh. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
