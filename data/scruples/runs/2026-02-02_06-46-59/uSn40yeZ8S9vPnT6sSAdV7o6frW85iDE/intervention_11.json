My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that the author had listed on eBay and sold for $45. The sister ate them without realizing their value, and the author is now feeling guilty and trying to make amends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a profit of $35 from selling these cough drops, which seems a bit high for something that's not really valuable. The sister ate them, thinking they were regular cough drops. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to the sister going back to college and not talking since. The author later apologized and decided not to make the sister pay for them, recognizing it was an honest mistake.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the author's reaction proportionate? The sister didn't know about the value, it was an accident. The author made a profit on an item that's not inherently valuable. The author's anger led to a breakdown in the relationship. The author is now trying to fix it, which is positive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have considered that the sister might not know the value of the item. Maybe the author didn't store it properly, or maybe the labeling wasn't clear. The fact that the author is now acknowledging the sister's perspective suggests that the initial reaction was too harsh. \n\nAlso, the 3-star review from the buyer complicates things, but that's more about the eBay transaction than the sister part. The main issue is the interpersonal conflict. The author yelling at the sister for an honest mistake, especially over a trivial amount, seems disproportionate. The sister's action wasn't malicious, so the author's anger was unwarranted. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because their reaction was excessive given the circumstances. They should have communicated better or stored the item more securely. The fact that they apologized and took responsibility is a good step, but the initial action was wrong.\n"
