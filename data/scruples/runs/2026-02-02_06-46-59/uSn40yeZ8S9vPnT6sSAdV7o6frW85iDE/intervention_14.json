My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the sister ate the cough drops that the author was selling on eBay, which turned into a $45 auction. The author got upset, yelled at her, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value involved. $45 is a significant amount, especially for something like cough drops, which are usually cheap. The author made a $35 profit, so it's not just the original cost but also the profit lost. The sister didn't realize the value, as she just liked the taste. That's a key point. The sister might not have intended to steal; she just thought they were regular cough drops. \n\nNow, the author's reaction: yelling and causing a rift. The sister left for college and hasn't communicated since. The author later apologized, which is good, but the initial reaction was harsh. From the sister's perspective, being yelled at over something she didn't know was valuable seems unfair. The author didn't consider her perspective, which is a mistake. \n\nBut there's also the financial aspect. The author had a legitimate loss of $35 profit. However, the way they handled it was extreme. Yelling and causing a family conflict over money, even if it's their profit, might be seen as disproportionate. The author could have handled it differently, like being frustrated but not yelling. \n\nThe fact that the author later apologized and tried to make amends shows they felt guilty, which suggests they realized their mistake. The sister's reaction (leaving) might have been impulsive, but the author's response was still the main issue. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the author did lose money, their emotional reaction was excessive. The sister didn't intend to harm them. So, the author is partly at fault for overreacting. However, the sister also didn't own up to the mistake until confronted. But the main wrong here is the author's handling of the situation. So, the answer is A.\n"
