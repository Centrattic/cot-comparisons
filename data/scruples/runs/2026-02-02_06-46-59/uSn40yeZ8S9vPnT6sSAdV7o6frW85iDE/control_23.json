My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The sister ate them without knowing their value, and the author ended up feeling terrible and reaching out to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author sold the cough drops on eBay for $45 but didn't mention their value to the sister. The sister, on the other hand, ate them because she liked the taste, not realizing their monetary value. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left. The author later apologizes and clarifies the situation, and the buyer was understanding but gave a 3-star review.\n\nPoints to consider: Did the author adequately communicate the value of the cough drops to the sister? If the author didn't explain their worth, the sister might not have known they were valuable. The author might be at fault for not informing her, leading to the misunderstanding. However, the sister did eat them without checking, which could be her mistake. But since the author was the one who got angry and yelled, that's a strong indicator of their wrongdoing. Yelling over an honest mistake, even if the item was valuable, might be excessive. The author's reaction caused a rift, but they took steps to fix it by apologizing and not making the sister pay. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should have communicated the item's value better. If the sister had known, she might have left them. The author's reaction was emotional and possibly disproportionate. However, the sister's action was an honest mistake. So, the author is partially at fault for not setting clear boundaries and for overreacting. But the sister also had a role in not checking the value. However, since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the main issue is their reaction. The answer leans towards A (yes), because the author's yelling was an overreaction to an honest mistake, especially when they didn't inform the sister of the item's value.\n"
