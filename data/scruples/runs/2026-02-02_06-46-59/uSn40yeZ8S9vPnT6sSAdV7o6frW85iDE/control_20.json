My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the main points here are about a sister eating cough drops that the author was selling for $45, leading to a conflict and the sister moving back to college.\n\nFirst, the author sold the cough drops on eBay, which were part of their inventory. They made $35 profit. The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author confronted her, yelled, and the sister left. The author later apologized and drove to her college, but the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author was selling the item, so it had value to them. Losing it meant losing money, which might explain the frustration. But yelling at a sister over something she didn't know was valuable could be seen as overreacting. The sister ate them, not stole them, and maybe she didn't realize the item's significance. The author's reaction led to a broken relationship temporarily, which seems harsh for a mistake.\n\nThe author did take steps to apologize, which shows they recognized the mistake. But the initial reaction\u2014yelling and causing the sister to leave\u2014might still make the author responsible. The sister's perspective is important here; she felt it was over a normal item, so the author's anger was misplaced. The fact that they later resolved it by apologizing and setting rules might mitigate some blame, but the initial action was still wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have a right to be angry? Possibly, but the way they expressed it was excessive. The sister didn't know the value, it was an honest mistake. The author's reaction caused more harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
