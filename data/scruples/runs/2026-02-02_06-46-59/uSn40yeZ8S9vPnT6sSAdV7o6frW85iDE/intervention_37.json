My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling online, which ended up costing them $45. The sister then went back to college and didn't talk to them since. The author later apologized and went to visit her, but the sister got a 3-star review from the buyer after the author had to explain the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author bought and sold items online, so maybe the cough drops were part of their business. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and their sister left, leading to a strained relationship. \n\nThe author made $35 profit from the cough drops. But the emotional cost was significant. The sister didn't realize the value of the item, which the author might have expected her to know. However, since they're family, maybe the author should have communicated better about the importance of the items they were selling. \n\nThe author's reaction seems disproportionate. Yelling and causing a rift over a $35 profit might be seen as overreacting. Even though the cough drops were for resale, the sister's mistake was honest. The author later took steps to fix the situation by apologizing and visiting her, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nThe sister might have felt that the value was unknown, especially if the branding (like Supreme) wasn't visible. The author might have not clearly communicated the value of the items. In family dynamics, expecting others to know the worth of your belongings without explanation can lead to misunderstandings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some fault. The sister ate something that wasn't hers, but the author's reaction was harsh. However, the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. Since the author admitted their mistake, took responsibility, and made amends, but initially overreacted, the answer likely leans towards them being in the wrong. \n\nThe 3-star review might not reflect the author's responsibility, but the main issue is the interpersonal conflict. The author should have handled the situation calmly instead of yelling. So, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was excessive and led to the sister leaving, even though they later made amends.\n"
