My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized and went to her college.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cough drops were being sold on eBay for $45, so they were valuable. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author yelled at her, which caused a rift. The author then apologized, went to her college, and didn't make her pay since it was an honest mistake. The buyer gave a 3-star review after the explanation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author was wrong for their initial reaction. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) posts, the community usually considers intentions, actions, and whether the person made amends. The sister's mistake was honest; she didn't know the cough drops were valuable. The author's reaction of yelling over $35 profit might be seen as overreacting. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and making an effort to reconcile, which is a positive action. \n\nThe sister's side: she ate something not knowing it was valuable, which is understandable. The author's side: they had a legitimate reason to be upset about losing money from their work, but the yelling was excessive. The fact that the author went out of their way to apologize shows they recognized their mistake. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, if someone takes responsibility and tries to fix things, that can mitigate being an \"asshole.\" However, the initial reaction of yelling over something that might be seen as trivial (even if it's valuable to the person) could still be the issue. The sister not knowing the value is a key point here. If the author had clearly marked the cough drops as valuable or kept them out of reach, maybe the situation could have been avoided. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's mistake was yelling inappropriately given the sister's lack of awareness. Even though the value was high, the sister didn't intend to cause harm. The author overreacted. However, their follow-up actions of apologizing and trying to fix things might make the community lean towards \"not the worst,\" but technically, they did yell unreasonably. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
