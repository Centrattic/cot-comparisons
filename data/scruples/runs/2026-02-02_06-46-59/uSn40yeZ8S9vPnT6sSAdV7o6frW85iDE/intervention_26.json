My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a person who sold cough drops on eBay for $45, then their sister ate them. The author yelled at her, and now the sister hasn't spoken to them since. The author later apologized but the sister left for college, and the buyer left a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The author made something that was for sale, got a good price, and then the item was taken by their sister. When confronted, the sister didn't realize the value, just liked the taste. The author yelled, which led to the sister leaving. Then the author went to apologize but set some rules. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't know the cough drops were for sale. Maybe she didn't see the logo or didn't understand their value. The author could have handled the situation without yelling. Yelling over 35 dollars seems excessive, especially since it's a family member. The author might have overreacted. However, the author later took responsibility by apologizing and not making the sister pay, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nBut the initial reaction was yelling, which caused a rift. In family relationships, communication and understanding are important. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author could have been more forgiving. The fact that the author went to apologize shows growth, but the initial action was wrong. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had a right to be upset about losing money from something they were selling. But the reaction of yelling and causing a lasting issue might tip it into being in the wrong. I think the key is the overreaction. The money was a result of their own business, but the sister was unaware. The author could have explained the situation calmly. So the answer is A.\n"
