My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were sold for $45 on eBay. The sister didn't know their value, ate them, leading to a fallout where the sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay, but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author had a legitimate item for sale, which they sold for a profit. The sister ate the item without knowing its value. The author's reaction was yelling and being harsh, which led to the sister leaving. The author did apologize later, which shows some accountability.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the cough drops were for sale and ate them out of curiosity. The author's reaction might have been over the top because the sister didn't intend to steal or harm. The value of $45 might seem high for cough drops, but since they were designer or branded (like Supreme, based on the name), maybe that's why. However, the sister's mistake was not knowing their value. The author could have handled it by educating her about their purpose and value instead of yelling. \n\nThe author did take responsibility by going to her college and apologizing, which is a good step. But the initial reaction of yelling seems excessive given the sister's lack of intent to cause harm. The sister's action was an honest mistake, and the author's response disrupted their relationship. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is in the wrong because they overreacted. The sister's mistake doesn't justify yelling and causing a rift. The author should have considered the sister's perspective and handled it more calmly. The fact that the author didn't make the sister pay and apologized shows they recognized their mistake, but the initial reaction was inappropriate. So, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
