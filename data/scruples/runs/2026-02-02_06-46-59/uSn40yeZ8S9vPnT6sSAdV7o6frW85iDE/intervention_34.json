My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sibling conflict over cough drops that were sold online.\n\nSo, the author bought and sold designer items on eBay. They had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45, making a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item and realized their sister had eaten them. The author yelled at her, leading to their sister going back to college and not talking since. The author feels bad and later went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong. The key points are: the item was sold online, the sister didn't know its value, the author reacted by yelling, leading to a broken relationship.\n\nThe author's mistake was not communicating the item's value to their sister. They might have assumed she knew it was valuable. Then, yelling over a mistake could be excessive, especially since it's family. The sister's action was an honest mistake, not theft. The author later took steps to fix it by apologizing, which shows they realized the error.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's reaction. Yelling at a sibling over something the sister didn't know was valuable seems harsh. The value here is both monetary and the relationship. The author prioritized the money over their sister's feelings, which is a common point in AITA scenarios. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted and didn't consider their sister's perspective initially.\n"
