My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating 45-dollar cough drops that were part of an eBay auction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author sells designer items on eBay and made an auction for \"Supreme cough drops,\" which sold for 45 dollars. They kept the items in their closet but couldn't find them when they wanted to deliver. Then they found the mangled box in their sister's room. They confronted the sister and yelled at her because she ate them, leading to her going back to college during Christmas break. The author feels bad and is considering apologizing. They eventually did go to her college and apologize, but the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nSo, the main points here are the value of the cough drops, the sister's actions, and the author's reaction. The author is upset about losing 45 dollars, but the sister didn't know their worth and ate them. The author yelled, causing a rift. The sister didn't know they were valuable, which might be a key point. The author later apologizes, so maybe they realized their mistake.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's action was accidental. The author made them into a collectible item through the auction, but the sister didn't know that. The author's reaction was yelling, which seems harsh. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing. The sister might not have intended to do harm. The author's mistake was not informing the family about the value of those items. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not securing their inventory properly and overreacting. But the sister also had a responsibility to check before eating something that might be valuable. However, cough drops are consumables, so expecting someone not to eat them when they're in a box labeled as such is unreasonable. The author should have stored them more securely, especially if they were valuable. Yelling led to the sister leaving, which could be seen as the author causing the problem. The sister's mistake was innocent. So, the author is in the wrong for their reaction and not properly storing the item. The answer is A.\n"
