My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The sister ate them without knowing their value, and the author felt wronged because they were meant to be sold. The author later apologized and went to their sister's college, which is a positive step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The cough drops were part of the author's eBay business. The sister didn't know about the auction or the value, so she consumed them. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given that the sister made a mistake. The fact that the author later took responsibility and apologized shows they realized their mistake in the yelling. \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't intend to steal or harm the author's business. The author's emotional response of yelling might have been disproportionate to the situation, especially since it led to a rift in their relationship. While the author had a right to be upset about losing the item, the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. \n\nHowever, the author did take steps to mend the relationship, which indicates they recognized their wrongdoing. The sister's perspective is important too; she might not have realized the item's value, making the author's anger seem overblown. In conflict resolution, how you handle the situation matters. Yelling can escalate things, even if the underlying issue has merit.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's initial reaction was probably inconsiderate of the sister's intentions and the situation's context. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong, but with the caveat that the sister made an honest mistake. The author's subsequent actions show they understood this, but the initial reaction was flawed.\n"
