My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops. The sister then left and they haven't talked since. The author feels bad and is going to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author was selling the cough drops on eBay and made a profit. Their sister ate them without knowing they were valuable. The author got angry and yelled, leading to the sister leaving. \n\nOn one hand, the author was justified in being upset about the lost item. The cough drops were part of their income, and losing $45 is significant. But yelling at the sister over an honest mistake might be too harsh. The sister didn't know about the value, so it's an accident. The author's reaction caused a bigger rift in their relationship. \n\nThe edit shows the author is taking steps to fix it by apologizing and not making their sister pay. That's a good sign. But the initial reaction was to yell, which could be seen as overreacting. The sister's perspective is that the situation wasn't worth 35 dollars, and the author's anger seemed disproportionate. \n\nConsidering emotional responses, the author might have felt frustrated and stressed about their eBay business, leading to an outburst. However, yelling and causing a family member to leave is a serious consequence. The key points are the sister's lack of intent to steal, the author's excessive reaction, and the relationship damage caused. \n\nSo, while the sister made a mistake, the author's response was likely over the top. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
