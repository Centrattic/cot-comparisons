My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they sold for $45. The sister went back to college and didn't talk to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author bought and sold designer items on eBay, and the cough drops were part of that. They made a $35 profit. The sister ate the cough drops, which the author then found out. The author yelled, leading to the sister leaving for college and not contacting them. The author later apologized and drove to her college, but the sister felt it was overreacting because she didn't know the value or the logo.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong for yelling. Let's consider the value of the item. $45 isn't a tiny amount, but it's also not life-changing. The sister didn't know the value because she didn't see the logo. The author was planning to deliver them, so the loss of the item caused a problem with the buyer. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be excessive, especially leading the sister to leave and not talk for a month. The author later took steps to reconcile, but the initial reaction seems harsh. The sister's mistake was innocent, so the author's response might have been disproportionate. The fact that the author later apologized and the sister's perspective shows she didn't realize the value suggests the author was wrong in their initial reaction. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
