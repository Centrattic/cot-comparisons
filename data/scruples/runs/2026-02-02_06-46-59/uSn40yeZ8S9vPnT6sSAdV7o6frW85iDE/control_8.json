My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they sold for $45.\n\nFirst, the author made money from selling those cough drops. The sister ate them without knowing their value, right? The author was upset because they lost the item they were supposed to sell. But did they overreact? Yelling and causing a rift where the sister hasn't talked to them since might be a problem.\n\nThe key points: The sister didn't know the drops were for sale. The author made a profit, but the sister's action led to the loss. The author felt the money wasn't worth the conflict. Then they went to apologize and made it right by not making the sister pay. The buyer gave a 3-star review, but the author handled it.\n\nThe sister might have been mistaken about the value. The author's initial reaction was angry, which caused the sister to leave. However, the author did take steps to mend the relationship. So maybe the author was in the wrong for overreacting, but they tried to fix it. But the question is whether they were in the wrong initially. \n\nSince the sister didn't intend harm and the author's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response for a mistake, the answer might lean towards A (author in the wrong). But the author did apologize and resolve it. However, the question is just about being in the wrong, not the resolution. So considering the sister's perspective, the author yelled over something the sister didn't know was valuable, so the author's reaction was excessive. Therefore, A might be the answer.\n"
