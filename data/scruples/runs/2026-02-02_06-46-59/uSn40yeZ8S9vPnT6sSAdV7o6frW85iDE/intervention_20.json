My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves an eBay auction where the sister ate the item the author was selling.\n\nFirst, the author was selling designer cough drops, which are probably luxury items. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author then yelled at her, which led to the sister leaving and not talking since. The author later apologized and drove to her college, so they might feel remorseful.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable; she just liked the taste. The author's reaction was yelling, which seems excessive for an honest mistake, even though the item was worth money. The author could have handled it calmly, maybe by explaining the situation and asking her to return some or replace them, but instead lashed out emotionally. \n\nHowever, the author did take responsibility later by apologizing and making amends. The sister's perspective was that the author was overreacting, which suggests that the author's reaction wasn't justified. While it's understandable to be upset about losing a sale, yelling and causing a rift in the relationship seems too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister did take something that wasn't hers, even if by accident. But given the context, the author's reaction was disproportionate. The fact that the author later apologized shows recognition of their wrongdoing. So, the initial reaction was in the wrong.\n"
