My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that the author had sold for $45 on eBay. The sister, in turn, went back to college and hasn't talked to the author since.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author bought and sold designer items on eBay, and these cough drops were supposed to be part of that. The sister ate them without knowing their value, which led to the author confronting her and yelling. The author felt bad and later apologized, which seems to have resolved things, but the question is whether the author was in the wrong initially.\n\nSo, considering the actions: the author made a profit from selling items, and the sister unknowingly consumed something the author intended to sell. The author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops; she just liked the taste. The author might have overreacted, especially considering the emotional impact of yelling and causing the sister to leave for college. \n\nHowever, the author did take steps to make amends by apologizing and visiting the sister. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she thought it was just regular cough drops, so she didn't realize the financial value. The author's mistake might have been not communicating the value of the items to the sister in the first place. If the author kept the cough drops in the same area as other items, maybe the sister didn't know they were for sale. \n\nThe yelling seems excessive for an honest mistake, especially since the sister had no malicious intent. The author's profit was $35, which is a significant amount relative to the cost of regular cough drops. The emotional response (yelling) and the lasting effect on their relationship (not talking for a month) might outweigh the financial gain. Additionally, the author later decided not to make the sister pay, which shows some understanding of it being an accident.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author was in the wrong. The sister didn't know the value, so the author's responsibility could be to keep their valuable items more secure or inform family members about their importance. Yelling in response to an honest mistake, especially leading to a family rift, suggests that the author overreacted. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not clearly communicating the value and for the harsh reaction.\n"
