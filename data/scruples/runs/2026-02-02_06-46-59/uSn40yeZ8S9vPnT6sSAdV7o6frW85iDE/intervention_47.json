My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops that were meant for eBay. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author sold items online and had these cough drops that were part of their inventory. The sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left. The author later realized it wasn't worth it and apologized.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable; she just liked the taste. The author, on the other hand, was using them for a business purpose. When the sister ate them, the author lost a product that was going to be sold for a profit. \n\nThe immediate reaction was yelling, which led to a breakdown in the relationship. The author did go back and apologize, which is a good step. However, the initial reaction of yelling seems excessive given that the sister didn't have malicious intent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have some accountability. If the cough drops were in a place accessible to the sister, maybe the author should have stored them more securely. However, the sister's action was an honest mistake. The author's emotional response of yelling might have been too harsh. \n\nAlso, considering the aftermath, the author did take steps to mend the relationship, which shows they recognize their mistake. But the question is whether they were wrong in the first place. \n\nI think the sister's actions were accidental, and the author's reaction was disproportionate. The value of the item was high compared to the sister's innocent mistake. So the author is partly at fault for overreacting. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
