My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. \n\nFirst, the cough drops were part of their eBay business. That's significant because it's not just a personal item; it's a product they were selling to make a profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value, which led to the author yelling.\n\nThe author made $35 profit from the sale. Losing that profit could have affected their business, especially if they rely on such sales. The sister's action was an honest mistake, as per edit 2. She didn't know the cough drops were for sale and their value. \n\nThe author's reaction was to yell, which might be seen as disproportionate. However, considering the context\u2014losing a sale that took effort and time\u2014it's understandable they were upset. The sister left the next day and hasn't communicated since, which adds emotional weight. \n\nThe author did apologize and went to her college, showing they realized their reaction might have been too harsh. They also didn't make the sister pay, acknowledging it was an honest mistake. \n\nBalancing both sides: the sister's mistake was unintentional, but the author's response (yelling) could have been more measured. However, the business aspect adds nuance. The author isn't in the wrong entirely, but they could have handled it better. But according to the question, the answer is A or B. Since the sister's action was a mistake and the author's response was intense, but not malicious, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A. However, given that the author took steps to fix it, B seems more likely.\n"
