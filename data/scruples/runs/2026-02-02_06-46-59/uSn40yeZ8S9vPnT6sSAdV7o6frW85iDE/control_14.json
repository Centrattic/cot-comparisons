My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were up for auction and sold for $45. The author is feeling guilty and went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The cough drops were part of their eBay business, which they bought and sold. The sister ate them without knowing their value, probably because they were in their shared home. The author got angry, yelled at her, and that led to the sister leaving. Then the author went to apologize, made some ground rules, and the sister didn't know the value.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to yell. The sister made an honest mistake. The author was running a business, so losing inventory is a real loss. But was the reaction proportionate? Yelling a lot and causing a rift where the sister didn't talk since might be excessive, especially since it was a mistake. The author later took steps to make amends, which is good. \n\nBut the initial reaction: was it wrong? The author might have had the right to be upset about losing a sale, but yelling might have been too harsh. The sister didn't know, so the author could have explained the situation calmly. The fact that the author went to apologize suggests they realized their reaction was too strong. \n\nHowever, the sister's action was careless, but not malicious. The value was high, but maybe the author should have stored them more securely if they were part of the business. The author's anger might be justified, but the way it was handled could be seen as wrong. So, considering both sides, the answer might lean towards the author being at least partially in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
