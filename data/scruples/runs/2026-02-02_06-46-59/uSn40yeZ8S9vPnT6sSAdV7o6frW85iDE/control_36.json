My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops, which the author had auctioned on eBay for a profit.\n\nFirst, the cough drops were for sale, so they had monetary value to the author. The sister didn't know their value, as she just ate them because she liked the taste. The author found out and yelled, which led to the sister leaving and not talking since. The author later apologized and went to her college, explaining it was an honest mistake. The sister's perspective is that the author overreacted over some regular cough drops, not realizing their actual worth or the brand's logo.\n\nFrom the author's side, they probably felt frustrated because they had invested time and effort into selling the item, and losing it meant losing profit. However, the sister had no intention of stealing; it was a mistake. The author's reaction was yelling, which escalated the situation, causing a rift. Even though the author apologized and made amends, the initial reaction might still be seen as excessive given the sister's lack of intent. \n\nThe key points are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the value, so the author's anger might be seen as disproportionate. On the other hand, the author had a legitimate reason to be upset about losing expected income. However, yelling and causing emotional harm could make the author partly at fault. The fact that the author took steps to fix it by apologizing and adjusting expectations shows they recognized the mistake, but the initial reaction was still problematic. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, since the sister made a mistake without malice, the author's reaction was harsh. Therefore, Answer A (author is in the wrong) would be appropriate.\n"
