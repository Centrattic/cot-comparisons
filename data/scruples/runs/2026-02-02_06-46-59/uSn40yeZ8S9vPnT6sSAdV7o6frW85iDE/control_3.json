My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over expensive cough drops. The sister ended up leaving and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author sells designer stuff online and had a cough drop auction. They sold them for $45 with a $35 profit. They couldn't find them until they saw the sister had eaten them. The author yelled, and the sister went back to college.\n\nHmm. The key points are the value of the item, the sister's intent, and the author's reaction. The cough drops were part of a sale, so the author had a responsibility to deliver them. The sister might not have known their value or the author's intention to sell them. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which led to the sister leaving. The sister thought it was just regular cough drops, maybe not noticing the brand. The author later apologized and didn't make her pay, which shows they realized maybe they were too harsh.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. The sister made a mistake, but the author's anger over $35 profit seems excessive. Maybe the author should have been more understanding, especially since it was a family member. Yelling and causing a rift over that might be too much. Also, the author later took steps to fix it by apologizing, which suggests they felt guilty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a right to be upset about losing a sale. But the way they reacted was probably too harsh. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, even though the sister was at fault for taking the item without permission.\n"
