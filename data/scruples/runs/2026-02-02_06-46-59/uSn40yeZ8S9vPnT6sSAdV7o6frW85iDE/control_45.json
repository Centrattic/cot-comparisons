My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. \n\nFirst, the context: The author sells items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that. They made a $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value, and the author yelled at her. Then the sister left and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and drove to her college.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and reaction. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops, which were part of a resale business. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to a strained relationship. The author did apologize and take steps to mend things, but the question is whether they were in the wrong initially.\n\nOn one hand, the sister made an honest mistake. She didn't realize the cough drops were valuable, so she ate them. The author's business loss was $35, which is significant, but the sister didn't have malicious intent. Yelling in such a situation might be seen as an overreaction, especially since it caused a rift in their relationship. The author later admitted it wasn't worth it for $35 and took steps to apologize, which shows they realized their reaction was too harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate business loss here. The cough drops were an asset they were selling, and losing them affected their income. The sister's action, while not intentional, did cause a financial impact. However, the way the author handled it\u2014yelling\u2014might be seen as disproportionate to the situation, especially considering the relationship and the sister's lack of awareness about the item's value.\n\nThe fact that the author later apologized and explained the situation to the buyer suggests that they recognized their mistake. The sister's perspective was that the author was being overly harsh about cough drops, which she didn't know were valuable. This indicates that the author's anger wasn't communicated in a way that explained the situation, leading to misunderstanding and hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the sister made a mistake, the author's reaction was the immediate cause of the conflict. The value of the item might be high to the author, but relationships often require understanding and communication, especially when others aren't aware of the stakes. Yelling in a fit of anger without explaining the significance could be seen as the author's fault.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was an overreaction given the sister's lack of intent and the author's failure to communicate the value properly before becoming angry. The subsequent apology shows they realized this, but the initial reaction was the issue.\n"
