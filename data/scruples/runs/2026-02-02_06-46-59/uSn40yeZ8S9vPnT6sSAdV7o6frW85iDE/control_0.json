My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person sells designer cough drops on eBay, making a $35 profit. They can't find the item after the sale, only to discover their sister ate them. They yell at her, leading to a fallout where the sister goes back to college and they haven't talked since. The person later apologizes, drives to her college, and explains the situation to the buyer, resulting in a 3-star review.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops, as she just liked the taste. The author was angry because she was supposed to deliver them, leading to a financial loss. However, the reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive. The sister's action was an honest mistake, not theft. The author later apologized and took responsibility, which is a positive step.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author stored the items in a place accessible to their sister without clear labeling, maybe they share some fault. But the sister eating something that was intended for sale might not be aware of its value. The author's anger was over $35, which is a small amount, and the emotional impact on their relationship might have been worse. However, the sister's action was unintentional. The author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate given the circumstances. So, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting, but the sister also has responsibility for not knowing the item's importance. However, the author did take steps to make amends, which is good. So, considering all factors, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they reacted harshly to an honest mistake.\n"
