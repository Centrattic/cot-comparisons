My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they sold for $45. The sister didn't know their value, ate them, and then the author yelled, leading to a falling out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly feels bad now and took steps to fix it by apologizing and driving to the sister's college. They also adjusted the situation by not making the sister pay because it was an honest mistake. On the other hand, the sister didn't know the drops were valuable, just ate them because she liked the taste. \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't know the drops were being sold, so she had no malicious intent. The author, however, was upset about losing $35 profit and reacted with yelling, which escalated things. The author's reaction might be seen as disproportionate because the sister didn't know the item's value. Also, the author made it clear that the items were for sale, but maybe they didn't communicate that properly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister made an honest mistake, but the author could have stored the items more securely or communicated their importance. The author's reaction of yelling seems harsh, especially leading to the sister leaving. However, the author did take the initiative to apologize, which is a positive step. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault for not securing the items better and for overreacting. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author's anger might be seen as excessive. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's nuance. However, since the user wants a strict A or B, and the main issue is the disproportionate reaction and not securing the items, I'll go with A.\n"
