My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating 45 dollar cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author feels bad and later apologizes but also sets some rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had a right to be upset. The cough drops were part of their eBay auction, which sold for $45, giving them a $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author confronted her and yelled, leading to her leaving. Now, the question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the sister didn't know the value of the drops. The author might have considered them valuable for the sale, but the sister just saw them as regular cough drops. Yelling at her could be seen as overreacting, especially since the sister had no ill intent. The author later apologized and went to see her, which suggests they realized the mistake. Also, they didn't make the sister pay, acknowledging it was a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a right to be upset about losing an item they intended to sell. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing a rift\u2014might be the problem. The value of $35 versus the relationship damage. The sister's perspective matters here; she didn't know the drops were valuable. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's anger was misplaced because the sister didn't know the item's worth. The author should have handled it calmly, explained the situation, and maybe set clearer boundaries. The yelling and causing a breakdown in communication likely made the situation worse. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for overreacting and not considering the sister's lack of awareness.\n"
