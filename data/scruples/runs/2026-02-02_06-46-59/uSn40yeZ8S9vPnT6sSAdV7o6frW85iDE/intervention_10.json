My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the author sells designer items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that. The sister ate them without knowing their value, and the author lost money. They yelled, sister left, and now the author is trying to make amends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable. She ate them by mistake. The author was selling them for profit, so losing the item meant losing income. The author reacted by yelling, which caused a rift. \n\nIs the author wrong for overreacting? Well, they had a legitimate reason to be upset because the item was part of their business. But yelling and causing emotional harm might be excessive. The sister's mistake was honest; she didn't know the value. The author's reaction led to a broken relationship. The author did apologize and drove to the sister's college, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nThe author's initial reaction seems harsh. While losing $35 is inconvenient, yelling at a sibling and causing them to leave without talking for a month seems disproportionate. The sister's perspective was that it was just cough drops, not understanding the business context. The author's anger led to emotional damage, which might be worse than the financial loss. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. They had a right to be upset about losing the item, but the way they handled it was excessive. The sister made an honest mistake, and the author's yelling was an overreaction that hurt the relationship. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
