My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops.\n\nFirst, the sister ate the cough drops without realizing their value. The author made a profit from selling them, so losing them was a financial hit. But the sister's action was accidental. The key here is intent. Did she know they were worth $45? The author says she didn't see the logo, so it was an honest mistake.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling and being harsh. That seems disproportionate for an honest mistake. The sister went back to college and didn't talk to the author since, which shows the emotional impact. The author later apologized and took responsibility, which is commendable. But the initial reaction was over the top. The value of the item might be high, but the sister didn't know. Yelling at her for something she didn't intend to do is where the author went wrong. The fact that the author later went to apologize and set ground rules suggests they realized their mistake. So overall, the author is in the wrong because their reaction wasn't appropriate for an honest error.\n"
