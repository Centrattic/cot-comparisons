My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister ate the cough drops that the author was selling. The author made $35 profit from them. The sister didn't know their value and just liked the taste. The author got really upset, yelled a lot, and the sister went back to college, not talking since. Now the author feels bad and is considering apologizing.\n\nSo, the main points here are: The sister's action was an honest mistake. She didn't know the cough drops were valuable. The author was selling them online and they had a high value. The author's reaction might have been too harsh given that it was a misunderstanding.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, cough drops are normal, so eating them isn't malicious. The author didn't mention the value to her before, so she had no way of knowing. The author got angry over a mistake, which could have been handled more calmly. The author did apologize later, which is good, but the initial reaction caused the rift.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The sister made an honest mistake. The author's yelling was excessive. Even though the item had value, the sister wasn't aware. The author should have explained the situation better instead of yelling. So, the author is at least partially in the wrong because they didn't communicate the value and overreacted.\n\nThe edits show the author is taking responsibility, which is positive, but the initial action was wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
