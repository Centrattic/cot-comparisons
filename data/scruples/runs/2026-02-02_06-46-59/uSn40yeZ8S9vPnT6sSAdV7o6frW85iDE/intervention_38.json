My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the sister ate the cough drops, which were part of the author's eBay auction, leading to a loss of $35 profit. The author then yelled at the sister, causing a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. Cough drops are not typically worth $45, so the fact that the author sold them for that much might be unusual. The sister probably didn't realize the item's value since it's not a typical product. The author was angry about losing money from their business, but the sister's mistake was in eating something she didn't know was valuable.\n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which is harsh. The sister didn't intend to steal or be wasteful; it was an honest mistake. The author later apologized and went to talk to the sister, showing they recognized the mistake in their reaction. However, the initial yelling seems disproportionate given the sister's lack of intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt stressed about their business, but that's not an excuse for yelling. The sister's action was careless, but the emotional response was intense. The resolution where the author apologizes and doesn't ask for money shows maturity, but the question is about whether the author was in the wrong initially.\n\nIn AITA situations, intent and proportionality matter. The sister had no malicious intent; the author's reaction was over the top. So the author is at least partially at fault for overreacting. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
