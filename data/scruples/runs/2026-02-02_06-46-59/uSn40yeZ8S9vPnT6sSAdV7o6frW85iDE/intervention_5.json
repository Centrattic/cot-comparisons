My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. They provided the story where the author yelled at their sister for eating cough drops they sold for $45, leading to a fallout. The sister hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the author was selling items on eBay, the cough drops were part of that, and the sister ate them without knowing their value. The author got angry and yelled, leading to the sister leaving. Now the author feels bad and tried to fix it by apologizing.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, the sister didn't know the value of the cough drops. The author is in a situation where they were selling the item, so it's their property. But the sister ate them by mistake. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive. They admitted it wasn't worth 35 bucks, so maybe the emotional response was out of proportion. The sister felt hurt and left, which is a big consequence. The author later took steps to make amends, which is good.\n\nBut the initial reaction of yelling at a family member over a mistake, even if the item had value, could be seen as wrong. It's about how they handled the situation. The sister didn't intend to take them; she ate them because she liked the taste. The author could have been more understanding. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for overreacting and hurting their sister's feelings. The answer is A.\n"
