My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The author made $35 profit from selling them on eBay, but the sister ate them. The author ended up apologizing and driving to the sister's college to make amends.\n\nFirst, the sister ate the cough drops, which the author was selling. The sister didn't know their value, as mentioned in Edit 2. The author got angry and yelled, leading to the sister leaving home and not talking since. The author later realized it might have been an honest mistake and apologized.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author overreact? Was yelling disproportionate? The sister wasn't trying to steal; she just ate them for taste. The author's reaction led to a broken relationship temporarily. However, the author did take responsibility by apologizing and making things right. \n\nBut the initial reaction of yelling seems harsh for a mistake. The sister didn't intend to harm the author, and the item's value wasn't clear to her. The author's frustration over losing $35 is understandable, but yelling and causing a rift is excessive. Also, the author later acknowledged the sister's perspective, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on whether the action was an overreaction given the circumstances. Here, the sister's action was innocent, and the author's response was harsh. Even though they made amends, the initial yelling was unjustified. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
