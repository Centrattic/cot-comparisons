My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about their sister eating their $45 cough drops. First, the author was selling them on eBay and made a profit, but then couldn't find the item. The sister ate them because she liked the taste. The author yelled at her, which led to the sister going back to college and not talking to them since.\n\nHmm. Well, the cough drops were being sold, so they were meant to be given to someone else. The sister probably didn't know their value or that they were for sale. The author had a right to be upset about losing the item and the money, but yelling at the sister seems excessive. Maybe the author overreacted. The sister made a mistake, but the author could have handled it more calmly. Also, the author ended up apologizing and even going to their sister's college, which shows they realized their mistake. The buyer got a 3-star review, but the author tried to make things right.\n\nSo considering all that, the sister's action was innocent, and the author's response was harsh, but they did take steps to fix it. The main issue is the yelling. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they overreacted, but maybe not entirely. Wait, the options are A for yes (author wrong) and B for no. I think the author is in the wrong because they yelled unnecessarily, even though they tried to make amends. So answer A.\n"
