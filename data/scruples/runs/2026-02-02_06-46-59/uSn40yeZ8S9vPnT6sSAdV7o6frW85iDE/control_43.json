My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So the situation is about their sister eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay.\n\nFirst, the author made a profit of $35 by selling the cough drops. They couldn't find them and found out the sister ate them. The author then yelled at her, leading to a fallout. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was selling the item, so it had value to them. The sister didn't realize the item's value, as she just ate them. The author was upset because they lost that profit. However, the way they reacted was yelling and causing a conflict. \n\nThe sister might not have known the cough drops were valuable or part of a sale. The author's reaction seems excessive for something that was an honest mistake. But the author did apologize later and tried to make amends, which is good. The sister's perspective is that it was over something normal, so the author's initial reaction was harsh.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author had a right to be upset about losing the item they were trying to sell. However, yelling and causing a rift over what the sister saw as an innocent mistake might make the author in the wrong. The resolution where the author apologizes and doesn't make the sister pay shows they realized this. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) terms, if the author's reaction was disproportionate, they might be the asshole. But since they took responsibility and made amends, maybe they're not the asshole. But the initial reaction was harsh. The sister didn't steal with intent, so the author's anger was maybe misplaced. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted by yelling, even though the sister made a mistake. The value was high to the author, but the sister's intent was innocent. The author should have handled it calmly instead of yelling, leading to a bigger problem.\n"
