My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about them yelling at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops, which they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. The author later went to apologize and made up ground rules, and the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was selling the cough drops for $45 and made a $35 profit. The sister ate them without knowing their value. The author reacted by yelling, which led to the sister leaving. Then, the author took steps to make amends by apologizing and not making the sister pay. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overreacted. The argument for the author being in the wrong could be that they got angry over something the sister didn't know was valuable. The cough drops were sold as a collectible or maybe a limited item, and the sister had no idea. The author's reaction of yelling might be excessive for an honest mistake. Additionally, the author later apologized and didn't hold the sister responsible, which shows they realized their mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they earned money from the sale and the sister's action caused a loss. However, the sister didn't know the item was for sale, so intent matters here. The author's response could have been more understanding. The fact that they later took responsibility by going to apologize supports the idea that they were in the wrong initially.\n\nI think the key here is the sister's intent versus the author's reaction. Since it was an honest mistake and the sister had no malicious intent, the author's yelling was disproportionate. The author's follow-up actions (apology, not making sister pay) suggest they acknowledge this. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
