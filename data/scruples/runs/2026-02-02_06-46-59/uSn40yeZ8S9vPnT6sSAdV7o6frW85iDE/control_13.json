My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they sold cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, but their sister ate them. The author got really upset and yelled at her, leading to the sister going back to college and not talking to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a legitimate investment in those cough drops. They were trying to make money through eBay, so losing that product could affect their business. The sister, on the other hand, might not have realized the value of the item. Cough drops aren't typically worth $45, so maybe she just saw them as regular medicine and didn't know they were for sale. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling, which is pretty intense. Yelling can be seen as aggressive and hurtful, especially if the sister didn't know the drops were valuable. The fact that the author lost their profit might explain their frustration, but yelling at family over something that, in hindsight, might have been a misunderstanding could be seen as overreacting. \n\nAlso, the sister's reaction was to leave and not talk to the author after that. That's a big consequence for eating cough drops. If the sister had no idea they were valuable, the author might have been too harsh. Plus, the author did apologize later and went out of their way to fix the situation, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nBut then again, the author did take responsibility and made things right. They went to visit her and set some boundaries. The sister might have been in the wrong by eating something that was for sale without knowing, but the author's response was the main issue here. Yelling is a strong reaction that could damage relationships. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because they overreacted. The sister made a mistake, but the author's response was disproportionate, leading to a big rift. However, the author did make amends, which is a positive step. But the initial action of yelling was not appropriate.\n"
