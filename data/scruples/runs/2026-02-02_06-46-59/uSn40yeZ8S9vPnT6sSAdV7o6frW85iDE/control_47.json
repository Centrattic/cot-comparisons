My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author sells items on eBay. They had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45, making a $35 profit. Then they can't find the item and discover their sister ate them. The author yells at her, leading to the sister going back to college and not talking to them since. The author feels bad and later apologizes but sets ground rules. The sister thought it was just normal cough drops and didn't know their value.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong. The answer choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister ate the cough drops without knowing they were valuable. The author, however, was upset about losing a $35 profit. While the sister's action was accidental, the author's reaction\u2014yelling and causing a rift\u2014might be seen as excessive. However, the author did take responsibility and apologize, which shows they realized their mistake.\n\nBut the initial reaction: was it wrong? The author was justified in being upset about losing a sale, but yelling and causing a family conflict over $35 could be considered disproportionate. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author could have handled it more calmly. The fact that they later apologized suggests they felt it wasn't worth the argument. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, people often consider intent. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author's reaction might be seen as over the top. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting, even if the situation was frustrating. \n\nBut there's another angle: the author's business is at stake. Losing a sale could affect their income. However, the amount involved is relatively small, so the emotional response might still be excessive. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a reason to be upset, their reaction was likely too harsh given the sister's innocent mistake. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
