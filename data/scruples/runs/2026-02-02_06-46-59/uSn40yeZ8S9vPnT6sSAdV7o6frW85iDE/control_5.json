My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops that the author was selling on eBay. The author made a profit of $35 from the sale, but the sister ate them without knowing their value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. $45 isn't trivial, especially if it's part of someone's income from a side hustle. The author was planning to deliver them, so their loss isn't just the item but also the potential for not being able to fulfill the order. However, the sister didn't know the item's value. She ate them because she liked the taste. That's an honest mistake, not theft or intentional harm. \n\nThe author's reaction was yelling and being harsh, which led to the sister leaving and not talking since. The fact that the sister didn't know the item was valuable changes things. If the author had explained the situation calmly, maybe the outcome would have been different. The author's anger over a sibling's honest mistake might be disproportionate, especially since they later decided to apologize and not ask for compensation. \n\nAlso, considering family relationships, overreacting can cause more damage than the item's value. The author's initial reaction caused a rift, but they tried to fix it by apologizing. The key points are whether the sister knew the value and if the author's reaction was justified. Since the sister didn't know and the author's anger was excessive, the author is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
