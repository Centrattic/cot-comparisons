My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the writer sells designer cough drops on eBay and made $35 profit from an auction. They couldn't find the item until they realized their sister ate them. They yelled at her, which led to her leaving for college and not talking since. The writer later apologized and didn't make the sister pay, thinking it was an honest mistake.\n\nSo, the main points are: yelling over $35 worth of cough drops, causing a rift with their sister. The sister didn't know the value of the item, just liked the taste. The writer's reaction seems disproportionate. Yelling and causing emotional harm over a small amount of money? That's a classic AITA scenario where the person might be in the wrong because their emotional response was too strong. Even though they apologized and made things better, the initial action of yelling was the problem. The sister's mistake was innocent, and the writer's reaction was harsh. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
