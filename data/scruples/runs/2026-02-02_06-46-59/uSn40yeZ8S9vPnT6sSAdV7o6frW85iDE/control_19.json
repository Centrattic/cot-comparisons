My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the author was selling them on eBay and made a profit, but the sister ate them. The author confronted her, yelled, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author later apologized and went to her college to make amends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reaction was reasonable. The cough drops were intended for sale, so losing them could lead to a loss of income. The author made $35 profit, which they value. However, yelling and causing a rift over that amount might be seen as disproportionate. The sister didn't know their value and ate them out of taste, which is an honest mistake. The author's anger led to the sister leaving and cutting off communication, which seems harsh for a mistake, even if the item had value. The author later took steps to fix it, which shows they realized their mistake. So, while the author had a right to be upset about losing the item, the way they handled it was probably wrong. The key points are the value of the item versus the relationship impact and whether the response was proportionate.\n"
