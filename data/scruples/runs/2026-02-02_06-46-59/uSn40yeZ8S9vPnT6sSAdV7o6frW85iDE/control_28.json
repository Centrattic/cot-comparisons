My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops without knowing their value, leading to the author's outburst and the sister going back to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was selling something valuable on eBay, which they probably worked hard to get a good profit from. Losing that item must have been frustrating. But they reacted by yelling at their sister, which caused a rift. The sister mentioned she just liked the taste and didn't realize the item's worth. \n\nIs it reasonable to yell over something someone didn't know was valuable? Maybe the author should have explained the significance of the item instead of getting angry. The sister's mistake was innocent, so the author's reaction might have been disproportionate. Also, considering they ended up apologizing and reaching out, it shows the author realized their mistake. \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The sister didn't intend to steal; she was unaware. The author's response, however, was yelling and making the sister feel bad, leading to a breakdown in communication. While losing money is frustrating, the emotional impact on the sister might have been worse. \n\nThe author later took steps to fix the situation by apologizing and setting boundaries, which is positive. However, the initial reaction of yelling was probably the main issue. So, in terms of being in the wrong, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the reaction was excessive given the sister's innocent mistake. The value of the item was high, but the sister's ignorance of that value makes the author's anger misplaced.\n"
