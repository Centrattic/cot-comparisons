My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over cough drops they sold for $45. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author made $35 profit from selling these cough drops on eBay. That's not a huge amount, but it's their money. The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author got angry and yelled, which led to the sister going back to college and not talking since. The author later apologized and drove to her college, which shows they regret their reaction.\n\nSo, the main points are: The sister didn't know the drops were for sale, it was an honest mistake. The author's response was yelling, which might have been excessive given the sister's lack of intent to harm. The author later took steps to make amends, which is positive.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. Well, yelling at a family member over a mistake, especially one that's not malicious, could be seen as overreacting. The sister probably didn't realize the value, so the author's anger was maybe misplaced. However, the author did take responsibility and apologize, so maybe they weren't entirely wrong. But the initial reaction was harsh. \n\nIn these situations, intent matters. The sister didn't mean to cause harm. The author's reaction, while understandable due to the lost profit, was possibly too harsh. So, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. But then again, they made an effort to fix it. Hmm. The answer might be A (author is wrong) because they yelled unnecessarily, but the sister's mistake was honest. Alternatively, maybe not, because the author's feelings about their work are valid. But generally, overreacting to a non-malicious mistake is seen as the person's fault. I think the answer leans towards A.\n"
