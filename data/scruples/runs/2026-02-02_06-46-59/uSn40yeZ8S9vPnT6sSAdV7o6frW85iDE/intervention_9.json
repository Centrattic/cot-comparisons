My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that the author had sold on eBay for $45, making a $35 profit. The sister then went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later went to apologize and explained the situation to the buyer.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the sister eating the cough drops without knowing their value, the author's reaction, and the aftermath. The sister didn't know the drops were being sold, so she ate them as she would normally. The author got angry and yelled, which caused the sister to leave. The author later took steps to mend the relationship by visiting and apologizing, which is a positive action.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's mistake was not knowing the item's value. The author, however, overreacted by yelling, which led to a significant rift. The value of the item was $45, which is a small amount compared to the emotional impact. The author's initial reaction was disproportionate to the sister's mistake. While the author did make a mistake in selling the drops, the sister's action was unintentional. The author could have handled the situation more calmly, maybe by explaining the value first before getting angry. The fact that the author later apologized and tried to make things right shows some self-awareness, but the initial reaction still seems to be where they went wrong. The answer would likely be A, as the author's overreaction was the main issue here.\n"
