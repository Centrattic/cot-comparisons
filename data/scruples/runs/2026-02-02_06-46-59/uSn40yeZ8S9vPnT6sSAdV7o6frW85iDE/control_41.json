My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author made $35 profit from selling these cough drops on eBay. The sister ate them without knowing their value, as it turns out. The author got really upset, yelled at her sister, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author later went to apologize and explained the situation to the buyer, who gave a 3-star review. The sister thought the author was being mean over \"normal\" cough drops, which suggests that the sister didn't even realize the product's value or the context of the sale.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable, the author's reaction was yelling, which led to a strained relationship, and the author later apologized but the sister's reaction was hurt. The sister's mistake was honest, as she just liked the taste and didn't know they were for auction.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The sister didn't intentionally take the cough drops for profit or anything. It was an honest mistake. The author's reaction was yelling, which seems excessive for an accidental action. The author later took steps to fix the situation by apologizing and not making the sister pay, which is a good move. However, the initial reaction might have been over the top. The emotional response led to the sister leaving and not talking, which is a significant consequence for a mistake that wasn't malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did own the cough drops and had a right to be upset about losing a product that was meant to be sold for a profit. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling\u2014might have been inappropriate. It's possible that a calm discussion could have resolved things without damaging the relationship. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author could have explained that first before getting angry.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was in the reaction rather than the sister's action. The author is in the wrong because they overreacted to an honest mistake, leading to unnecessary harm to their relationship. The sister's action wasn't malicious, so the author's yelling was unwarranted. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
