My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that they sold something for $45, the sister ate them, and then the person yelled, leading to a rift.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They got angry, yelled a lot, and the sister left. The sister didn't know the value, just liked the taste. The author later apologized but the relationship is strained. \n\nSo, the key points here. Was the reaction proportionate? $45 isn't a huge amount, but maybe the author saw it as significant since it was profit. The sister didn't know the item's value. The author's yelling caused a bigger issue. The sister's action was innocent but the author's response was harsh. \n\nThe author later apologized and tried to make amends. That shows they realized they overreacted. The sister's perspective is important here. She didn't intend to cause harm. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's initial reaction was overly harsh given the sister's lack of awareness. Yelling and causing a breakup in communication for a $35 profit is a big deal. The author's actions led to a month of no contact, which might not have been necessary. \n\nSo, while the sister made a mistake, the author's response was disproportionate. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
