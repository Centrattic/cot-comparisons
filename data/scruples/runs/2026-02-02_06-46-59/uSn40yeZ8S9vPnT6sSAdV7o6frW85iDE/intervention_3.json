My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the sister ate the cough drops that the author was selling on eBay. The author made $35 profit from the sale, but the sister didn't know their value. The author confronted her, yelled, and the sister went back to college, not talking to them since. The author later apologized, and the sister didn't know about the item's value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overreacted. The cough drops were worth $45, but the sister consumed them without knowing about the eBay auction. The author's reaction was yelling, which is a strong response. The sister's perspective is that she didn't realize the item's value. The author later apologized, which shows some remorse.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the key points are: Did the author have a reasonable expectation that the sister would know the value of the item? Probably not. The sister eating them was an honest mistake. The author's reaction, while understandable given the financial loss, was excessive. Yelling and causing emotional harm for a mistake, especially over a profit of $35, might be considered wrong. The author later took steps to fix the relationship, which is good, but the initial reaction was harsh.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they overreacted to an honest mistake, leading to a breakdown in the relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
