My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author sells designer items on eBay. They had an auction for Supreme cough drops that sold for $45, making a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item and later saw their sister had eaten them. The author yelled at her, and she left, not talking since. The author feels bad and later apologized but got a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The cough drops were being sold, so their value is higher because of the brand (Supreme is a luxury brand). The sister ate them without knowing their value, maybe. The author felt wronged because they were about to deliver the item and lost the profit. But yelling and causing a rift seems harsh.\n\nLegally, the sister might not be responsible since she ate them unknowingly. The author's reaction was yelling, which could be seen as excessive for an honest mistake. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay, which shows they acknowledged some fault. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she might not have realized the item's value or that they were for sale. The author's emotional reaction (yelling) led to a strained relationship, which the author now regrets.\n\nSo, while the sister did do something wrong by taking the item, the author's response was disproportionate. It's about whether the yelling was justified. Since the sister didn't know the value and it was an honest mistake, the author's reaction might be seen as over the top. The author is in the wrong for overreacting, even if the sister did something bad. The author took responsibility by apologizing and driving to the college, which is a good step. But the initial yelling caused the problem. So the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was inappropriate for an honest mistake.\n"
