My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves an eBay auction, the sister eating the item, and the resulting fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made $35 profit from selling cough drops, which seems a bit high. The sister ate them without realizing their value. The author confronted her, yelled, and the sister left. The author later apologized and didn't make her pay because it was an honest mistake.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be in the wrong because they overreacted to a mistake. The sister didn't know the drops were valuable, so eating them was an accident. Yelling and causing a rift over a relatively small amount of money could be seen as disproportionate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author worked hard to make that profit, and losing the item would have cost them $10 from the $35 profit (since they made $35 profit, the total was $45). Maybe they felt frustrated because they had to deal with the stress of not being able to deliver the item, leading to a bad review. However, the reaction of yelling and the sister leaving might still be excessive.\n\nThe author did take steps to make amends by apologizing and visiting the sister, which shows they realized their mistake. The sister's perspective is that it was just cough drops, not understanding their value. The author's initial reaction was based on the item's monetary value, while the sister didn't see it the same way.\n\nIn situations like this, communication is key. The author might have handled it better by explaining the situation calmly first instead of yelling. The emotional response led to a bigger problem than the original issue. So, considering all factors, the author's overreaction makes them at least partially in the wrong. The fact that they later apologized is good, but the initial reaction was misplaced.\n"
