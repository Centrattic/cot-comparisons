My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were being sold on eBay for $45. The sister then went back to college and they haven't talked since, but the author later went to apologize and things seem to be resolved. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was selling the cough drops on eBay, made a profit, but the sister ate them without knowing their value. The author confronted her, yelled a lot, and she left. The sister didn't know the value of the items, and the author later apologized and didn't make her pay. The buyer gave a 3-star review after the author explained the situation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B). Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were trying to make a sale and someone else (sister) consumed the item. They might feel wronged because the sister didn't respect their property or the effort put into selling it. However, the sister was a family member, and the item was something like cough drops, which are consumable. She might not have realized they were valuable. The author could have handled it more calmly, but the fact that they went to apologize and resolved the situation might show they took responsibility.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she's a family member, so maybe she didn't expect her sibling to be so strict. Eating cough drops might seem normal, especially if they look like regular ones. The author's reaction was overly harsh, leading to the sister leaving. However, the sister didn't replace the item, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's yelling seems excessive. The value is $45, but for a sibling relationship, yelling and causing a rift might not be worth it. The author's follow-up actions (apologizing, not making her pay) show they realized their mistake. The sister's reaction of going back to college might be a big deal, but maybe she was already planning to leave or was upset.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister did eat the item, but the author could have communicated better. Maybe the cough drops were stored in a way that wasn't clear they were for sale. The author might have been aware of the sister's habits and didn't secure the items properly. The sister might not have known their value, so it was an honest mistake. The author's reaction was harsh, but they took steps to fix it.\n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) dynamics, the key is whether the author's actions were reasonable. Yelling at a sister for an honest mistake might be considered overreacting. The fact that the author drove to her college to apologize suggests they felt they were in the wrong. However, the sister's reaction of leaving could be seen as equally problematic, but the user is focusing on the author's actions.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's initial reaction was probably too harsh. The sister made an honest mistake, and yelling at her for it, especially leading to a rift, might not have been justified. The author's later actions show they recognized this. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
