My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author sold designer cough drops for $45 on eBay and made a $35 profit. Then, they couldn't find the item and discovered their sister ate them. They yelled at her, leading to her leaving and not talking since. The author later apologized and drove to her college, but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the value of the item, the sister's intent, and the author's reaction. The cough drops were sold as designer, which might mean they were luxury or branded items, not regular ones. The sister ate them thinking they were normal, not knowing their value. The author got upset over $35 profit, which seems a bit high for cough drops, but maybe it's a niche market.\n\nThe sister's action was an accident, not theft. She didn't know they were valuable. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given it was a mistake. However, the author did take steps to make amends by apologizing and contacting the buyer. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? They owned the item, and the sister took it without permission. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing a rift\u2014could be seen as overreacting. The sister might not have understood the item's value, so the author should have explained the situation calmly. Yelling led to the sister leaving, which seems harsh. The author's initial anger might be justified given the lost profit, but their response could have been better. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be at fault for the way they reacted rather than the fact that they got upset. The sister made a mistake, and the author's reaction exacerbated the problem. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for overreacting, but there's nuance here. Alternatively, maybe not, because the item was valuable. Wait, but the sister had no ill intent. The author could have handled it more maturely. So I think the answer is A.\n"
