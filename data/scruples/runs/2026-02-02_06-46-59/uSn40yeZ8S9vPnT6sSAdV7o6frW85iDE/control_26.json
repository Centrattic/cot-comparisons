My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them yelling at their sister for eating $45 cough drops they were selling on eBay. The sister went back to college and they haven't talked since. The author later drove to her college to apologize but also set rules.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are:\n\n1. The author was selling cough drops on eBay, which the sister ate. This was an honest mistake from the sister's side, as she didn't realize their value.\n2. The author yelled at her, which led to the sister leaving and ending communication during Christmas break.\n3. The author later took steps to reconcile, apologizing and not making the sister pay for replacement.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The sister didn't intentionally steal; she ate them because she liked the taste, not knowing their value. The author's reaction was yelling, which might be seen as excessive for an honest mistake. However, the author did make amends by apologizing and addressing the issue with the buyer.\n\nThe sister's perspective is important here. She felt the author was being overly harsh about cough drops, which she didn't know were valuable. The author's emotional response (yelling) could be seen as disproportionate, especially since the item was consumed accidentally. However, the author did take responsibility later, which is a positive step.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the initial reaction of yelling might be considered wrong because the sister didn't act with malice. The author's follow-up actions (apologizing, not making the sister pay) show they recognized their mistake. But the initial yelling led to a breakdown in their relationship, which is significant.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the yelling was an overreaction. Since the sister had no intent to harm, the author's reaction might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author did correct their actions afterward. The main issue is the initial reaction rather than the subsequent steps. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting, but the resolution shows growth. The key is whether the response was justified given the sister's lack of intent. Probably, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the yelling was excessive for an honest mistake, even though they made amends.\n"
