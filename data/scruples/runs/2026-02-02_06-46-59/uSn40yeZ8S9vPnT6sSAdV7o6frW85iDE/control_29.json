My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over the cough drops. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author sells designer items on eBay, and this time, the Supreme cough drops sold for $45, giving them a $35 profit. Then they couldn't find the item. The sister had eaten them because she liked the taste. The author got really upset, yelled at her, and the sister went back to college, not talking since. The author later apologized and went to visit her, but the buyer gave a 3-star review.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction. Yelling at a sibling over something that was intended to be sold. The value is $35 profit, but the sister didn't know the item was for sale. The author kept the item in their closet, so maybe they didn't clearly communicate that it wasn't for personal use. If the sister wasn't aware it was meant to be sold, her eating them was an honest mistake. The author's anger seems out of proportion to the situation, especially considering it was a family member. The fact that the author drove to the sister's college to apologize shows they recognized a mistake, maybe in their reaction. However, yelling and causing emotional distress over a $35 item seems excessive. The sister's perspective might not have known the value, so the author's reaction was too harsh. The author decided not to make the sister pay, which is good, but the initial yelling and causing the sister to leave still indicates the author was at fault. The buyer's 3-star review is a consequence, but that's more about the transaction, not the sister part. So overall, the author probably is at least partially in the wrong for overreacting and not considering the sister's lack of knowledge about the item's purpose. But maybe not entirely? However, the options are A for yes, B for no. Since the sister had an honest mistake, the author should have handled it calmly. So the answer is A.\n"
