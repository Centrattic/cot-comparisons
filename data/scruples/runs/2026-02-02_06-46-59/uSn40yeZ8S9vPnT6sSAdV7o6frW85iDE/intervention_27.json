My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating their $45 cough drops. The author sold them on eBay, made a $35 profit, but the sister ate them, not knowing their value. The author then yelled, which led the sister to go back to college and they haven't spoken since. The author felt bad and went to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The sister didn't know the cough drops were for sale, right? The author kept them in a closet, which might not be a place others would expect. The sister found them on the dresser, maybe the author left them there? Wait, the author says they found the mangled box on her dresser. So the cough drops were in the author's closet, but the sister took them from there and put the box on her dresser? Or maybe the author had them ready to be delivered, and the sister took them from the closet where they were stored?\n\nThe key points here are whether the author clearly communicated to their sister that the cough drops were for sale. If the item was in their own closet, which is a private space, maybe the sister had no reason to know they weren't for personal use. The author might have been careless in storing the item in a way that a family member could access it. The sister ate them, thinking they were regular cough drops, which might be a reasonable assumption unless the author made it clear they were for eBay. \n\nYelling at her over something that was an honest mistake seems harsh, especially since the value is $45. Family relationships are important, and losing them over a mistake like this could be seen as disproportionate. The author later apologized and decided not to make the sister pay, which shows some remorse, but the initial reaction of yelling might have been the main issue. \n\nAlso, the sister left and didn't communicate since, which suggests the author's response may have been too aggressive. The author should have handled the situation more calmly, explained the situation, and maybe set boundaries earlier. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they didn't make the intention to sell clear, and their reaction was excessive. The answer should be A.\n"
