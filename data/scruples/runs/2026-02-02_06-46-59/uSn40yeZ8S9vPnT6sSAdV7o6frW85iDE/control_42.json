My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about yelling at a sister for eating cough drops that were meant to be sold for $45. The sister didn't know their value and ate them. The author feels bad and later goes to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a legitimate item they were selling, which they probably worked hard to get and made a profit on. Losing that item because a sister ate it without knowing could be frustrating. But the reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive. The sister didn't know the value, so maybe the author overreacted. The fact that they later apologized and took responsibility shows they realize their mistake. The sister left and didn't talk since, which is a big consequence for something the author later deemed not worth $35. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister ate something that wasn't hers, which is wrong too. But the author's response was yelling, leading to a broken relationship. The key here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Since the sister didn't know the value, the author's anger over a $35 profit might be seen as the bigger issue. The author did make amends, which is good, but the initial reaction was harsh. So the author is partially at fault for overreacting, even if the sister made a mistake. So the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
