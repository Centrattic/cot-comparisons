My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author bought and sold items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that, reaching $45. They lost money when their sister ate them. They yelled at her and now the sister hasn't talked to them since. The author later went to apologize, but the sister's reaction was that the author was being mean over \"normal cough drops\" that she didn't know the value of.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the author overreact? Was it wrong to yell? The sister didn't know the value, so maybe she didn't intend to cause harm. The author made a profit of $35, but the sister's action led to a loss. However, the emotional impact on the sister seems significant\u2014leaving for college and not talking for a month.\n\nThe author did apologize and went to make things right, but the damage was done. The key factors are intent, proportionality of the response, and the relationship between the siblings. The sister's action was accidental, so the author's response of yelling was harsh given that. The author's mistake was not communicating the value of the item beforehand. Maybe they should have kept the cough drops somewhere more secure or informed the sister. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Well, the sister didn't mean to cause financial loss, so yelling at her over it seems excessive. The author's emotional reaction caused a rift in their relationship, which is more significant than the financial loss. The answer likely is that the author is in the wrong because their reaction was disproportionate to the sister's mistake. So, Answer A.\n"
