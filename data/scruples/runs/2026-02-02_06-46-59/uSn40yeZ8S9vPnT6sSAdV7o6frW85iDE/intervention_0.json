My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation they described. The scenario is about a person who sells designer cough drops on eBay for $45, and their sister ate them. The author yelled at the sister, and their relationship has been broken since. The author later apologized but still got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was selling something that was valuable to them (they made a $35 profit), and the sister ate it without realizing the value. The author's reaction was yelling, which led to the sister not speaking to them. The author later apologized and went to their college, but the sister felt it was overreacted for just cough drops. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction was appropriate. The sister didn't know the value of the cough drops, possibly because they were branded as \"Supreme\" (which might be a brand name, not the slang for something important). The author might not have communicated the importance or value of the item to their sister, leading to the sister's unintentional mistake. \n\nThe author yelling and causing a rift in the relationship seems excessive, especially since the sister didn't know. The author did take steps to fix the situation by apologizing, which is good, but the initial reaction was harsh. The fact that the sister felt it wasn't worth getting angry over $35 suggests that the author overreacted. \n\nOn the other hand, the cough drops were part of their business, so losing them could be frustrating. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and causing the sister to leave\u2014might have been too harsh. The sister's perspective is that it was an innocent mistake, and the author's reaction was disproportionate. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is in the wrong for overreacting and yelling, even if the item was valuable. The sister didn't know the value, and the author should have handled the situation with more understanding and communication. The fact that the author later apologized shows they realized this, but the initial action was wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
