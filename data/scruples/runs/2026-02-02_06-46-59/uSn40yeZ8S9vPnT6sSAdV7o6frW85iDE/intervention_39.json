My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over expensive cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops that the author had put up for auction on eBay, which ended up selling for $45. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since. Now the author is trying to make amends by apologizing and even driving to her college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author had a legitimate reason to be upset because the cough drops were part of their business and sold for a significant amount. However, the sister's mistake was honest\u2014she just liked the taste and didn't realize their value. The author's reaction of yelling could be seen as excessive given that it was an honest mistake. The sister was probably unaware of the item's importance and the financial aspect. The author's anger led to a breakdown in their relationship, which the author later regretted enough to apologize and offer a resolution. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister did take the item without permission, even if it was a mistake. The author has a right to be upset about losing a valuable item. However, the way they handled the situation\u2014yelling and causing the sister to leave\u2014might have been harsh. The key here is whether the reaction was disproportionate to the mistake. Yelling and causing estrangement over a $35 profit might be considered overreacting, especially since it was an innocent mistake. The author later apologized, which shows they recognize the mistake in their response, but the initial action was still a problem. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's reaction was more intense than necessary. The sister didn't act maliciously, so the author being in the wrong for the yelling is justified. The answer is A.\n"
