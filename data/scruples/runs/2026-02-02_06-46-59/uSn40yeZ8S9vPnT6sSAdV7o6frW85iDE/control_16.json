My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. So the situation is that the author sold some designer cough drops for $45 on eBay, made a $35 profit, and then the sister ate them. The author was upset and yelled, leading the sister to leave. Now the author is feeling bad, apologized, and drove to her college.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points here are the value of the item, the sister's actions, and the author's reaction. The cough drops were sold for $45, which is a significant amount for something that's normally a cheap item. The sister ate them thinking they were normal, not knowing their value. The author lost the profit and had to explain to the buyer, resulting in a bad review.\n\nThe author yelled at the sister, which is a strong reaction. But the sister's action was an honest mistake. The author later apologized and tried to make amends. The sister's reaction was to go back to college, which might have been an overreaction on her part as well, but the initial problem is the author's yelling.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author probably overreacted. While the cough drops had monetary value, they aren't something that's typically worth getting angry over, especially with family. The sister didn't know the value, so it was an honest mistake. The author's yelling led to a breakdown in their relationship, which is worse than the financial loss. The author taking steps to apologize is good, but the initial reaction was wrong.\n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they overreacted to an honest mistake, leading to unnecessary conflict. The financial loss isn't worth the damage to their relationship. The sister's mistake was understandable, and the author should have handled it more calmly.\n"
