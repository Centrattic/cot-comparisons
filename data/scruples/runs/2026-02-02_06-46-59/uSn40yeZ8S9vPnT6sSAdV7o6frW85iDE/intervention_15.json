My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over the cough drops. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author made $35 profit from auctioning supreme cough drops on eBay. The sister ate them without knowing their value, and the author lost the item. The author then yelled at the sister and they haven't talked since. The author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay, but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the author's reaction. The sister didn't know the cough drops were valuable; she just liked the taste. The author lost a significant amount of money (relative to a cough drop's usual cost) because of this. But the way the author reacted was yelling, which strained their relationship. \n\nOn one hand, the author's frustration is understandable\u2014they worked to make a profit and lost the item. Yelling, though, might be excessive. The sister made an honest mistake. The author took the right step by apologizing and didn't push for repayment, which shows they realized their mistake. \n\nBut the core issue is the initial reaction. Was it wrong to yell? The value of the item is high, but so is the relationship with a sibling. The author's anger led to a breakup in communication. The sister might have felt attacked, especially if she didn't know the cough drops were valuable. The author could have handled it more calmly, maybe by explaining the value earlier. \n\nThe author's own edit says they feel it wasn't worth it for $35. That suggests they regret the reaction. The apology and trying to fix things are positive steps, but the question is about whether the initial action was wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sister's mistake was innocent. The author could have been more communicative about the value of items they kept. However, the sister's action was a mistake, so the author's harsh reaction might be seen as disproportionate. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their reaction was excessive and they didn't consider the sister's perspective initially. They handled it poorly but later made amends. The main issue is the yelling and not being understanding of the sister's ignorance of the item's value.\n"
