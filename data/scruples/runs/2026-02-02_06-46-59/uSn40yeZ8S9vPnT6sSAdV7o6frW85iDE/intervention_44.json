My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling on eBay, which ended up being worth $45. The sister went back to college and hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was selling the cough drops on eBay and made a profit. They were upset because the sister ate them without knowing their value. The sister's perspective, as mentioned in edit 2, is that she didn't know they were valuable or that they were for sale. She just liked the taste.\n\nThe author yelled at her, which caused a rift. The sister left, and the author feels bad. They later apologized, which is good. The question is whether the author was wrong for yelling. \n\nFactors to consider: Was the sister intentionally stealing? She didn't know their value. The author might have been overly emotional about losing $35 profit, but it's still their property. However, yelling and causing a family conflict over that might be excessive. The sister didn't know they were valuable, so maybe she didn't have malicious intent. \n\nThe author took the initiative to apologize and set boundaries, which shows they recognized the problem. But the initial reaction of yelling might have been disproportionate. The value of the item, while significant to the author, is relatively small in the grand scheme. Reacting with anger leading to a family member leaving is a big consequence. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have handled it more calmly. Maybe they could have explained the situation without yelling. The sister's mistake was honest, so the author's reaction might have been harsh. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction was inconsiderate and caused unnecessary harm. They are in the wrong for overreacting. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
