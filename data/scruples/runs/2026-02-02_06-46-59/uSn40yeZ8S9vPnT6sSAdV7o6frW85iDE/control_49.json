My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation is that the author sells items on eBay, and they had an auction for Supreme cough drops which sold for $45. The sister ate them, not knowing their value, and the author yelled at her. They ended up not speaking since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author was selling these as part of their business, so the cough drops had significant value to them. The sister, on the other hand, probably saw them as regular cough drops and ate them without realizing. The author lost a sale and made a profit, but the sister didn't know. The author yelled, which led to a rift.\n\nFrom the author's side, maybe they were stressed about their business and felt the items were important. But yelling and causing a family conflict over something that was an honest mistake might be excessive. The sister didn't have intent to harm, just a lack of awareness. The author later apologized, so they realized their mistake to some extent. However, the initial reaction of yelling could be seen as disproportionate, especially since the sister didn't know the value. The fact that the author chose not to make the sister pay shows understanding, but the initial outburst might still be the issue.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if someone accidentally takes your property, is it wrong to yell at them for not knowing? The author should have explained the value first before getting angry. Maybe the sister could have been more careful, but the author's reaction was harsh. Family conflicts can be sensitive, and handling it with more understanding might have been better. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for overreacting, but there's a balance here. The sister's perspective is that it's just cough drops, while the author's livelihood was affected. However, the way the author handled it by yelling instead of calmly explaining could be the issue. So, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they overreacted and caused a family issue over an honest mistake.\n"
