My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops, which caused their sister to leave and not talk to them since. The sister ate the cough drops, thinking they were normal, and the author didn't mention the value or the logo. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made a profit of $35 on the cough drops, which they sold on eBay. The sister didn't know they were valuable and just ate them because she liked the taste. The author got angry, yelled at her, and that led to the sister going back to college. The author later apologized but got a 3-star review from the buyer.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the value of the item and the sister's knowledge. The author didn't inform the sister about the cough drops' value or the fact that they were for sale. The sister, in her own defense, just saw them as regular cough drops. So, the author's anger was over something the sister didn't realize was important. \n\nYelling and causing a rift over an honest mistake might be seen as overreacting. Even if the item had value, the sister didn't intend to steal or take it. The author could have handled it without yelling. Also, the author's decision to apologize and not make the sister pay shows they realized the mistake. The sister's reaction (leaving and not talking) might have been impulsive, but the initial reaction from the author was harsh. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for overreacting. They should have been clearer about the value of the cough drops and handled the situation more calmly. The sister made an honest mistake, and the author's yelling was disproportionate. The answer is A.\n"
