My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author yelling at their sister for eating cough drops that were worth $45 when sold. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author sells items on eBay, and these cough drops were part of that. The sister ate them, leading to the author's outburst. The author now feels bad, especially since their sister hasn't spoken to them since. The author later went to apologize, and the sister felt it was over something trivial.\n\nSo, the main question is about responsibility and proportionality. The author's reaction seems intense for cough drops that ended up being valuable because of an auction. The sister, on the other hand, didn't know their value and just liked the taste. \n\nWas the author in the wrong? Well, the author did yell and caused a rift. Even though the items are valuable to the author's business, the sister had no way of knowing their value. The author could have handled the situation with more understanding, maybe explaining the value instead of yelling. The fact that the author later apologized and didn't make the sister pay suggests they realize their mistake. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The sister's actions were an honest mistake. The author's reaction was excessive. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Even though the author had a legitimate reason (the money they made), the way they handled it was inappropriate.\n"
