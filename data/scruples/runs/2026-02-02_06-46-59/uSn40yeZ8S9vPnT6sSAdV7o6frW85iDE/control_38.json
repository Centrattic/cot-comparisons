My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about them yelling at their sister for eating cough drops they were selling for $45. The sister ate them because she liked the taste, not knowing their value. The author feels bad, went to apologize, and the sister didn't know about the price or the brand (like Supreme, which might be a brand here).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was running an eBay auction for these cough drops, which sold for $45, giving them a $35 profit. They couldn't find the item and found out their sister ate them. They yelled, sister left, and now they're regretting it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did lose $35 due to their sister's mistake. But the sister didn't know the value. Yelling seems excessive for a mistake, especially if the sister wasn't malicious. The author later apologized and set boundaries, which is good. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she thought they were normal cough drops. The author's reaction might have been over the top because of the money involved, but the sister didn't intend to cause harm. So, maybe the author is partly at fault for overreacting, but the sister's action was a mistake. The answer depends on whether the reaction was justified. Since the sister didn't know, yelling seems harsh. So the author is in the wrong (A). But maybe not entirely, because the sister should have asked? Hmm. But since it was a mistake, maybe the author should have been more understanding. So answer A.\n"
