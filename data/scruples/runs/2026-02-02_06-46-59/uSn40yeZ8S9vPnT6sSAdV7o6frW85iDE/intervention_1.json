My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The sister ate them without knowing their value, and the author felt justified because they were for sale. The author later apologized, but the question is about whether they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She might not have realized the cough drops were valuable. If the author had clearly communicated that they were for sale, maybe the sister wouldn't have eaten them. But if the author didn't mention the value, then the sister's mistake is understandable. The author's reaction was yelling, which might have been excessive given that it was an honest mistake. The fact that the sister went back to college and didn't talk since shows the emotional impact. The author felt bad and went to apologize, which is good, but the initial reaction was harsh. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the profit was $35, which is not a huge amount. The sister didn't know the worth, so she didn't intend to steal. The author's yelling over something the sister didn't know was valuable could be seen as overreacting. The author's actions led to a strained relationship, so maybe they were in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a legitimate item they were selling, so losing it affected their income. But the sister's mistake was unintentional. The author's anger might be justified, but the way they handled it (yelling) was not. So overall, the author's reaction was disproportionate, making them in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
