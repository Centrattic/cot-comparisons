My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over expensive cough drops. So, the author sold the cough drops on eBay for $45, made a $35 profit, but the sister ate them. The author confronted her, yelled, and now the sister hasn't talked to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author probably felt wronged because they had a product for sale and someone consumed it, leading to a loss. But the sister didn't know they were for sale, right? She just ate them thinking they were regular cough drops. The author might have overreacted. Yelling seems harsh, especially over $35 profit. The sister might not have intended to cause harm.\n\nThe author later went to apologize and set ground rules, which is good. Also, they didn't make the sister pay because it was an honest mistake. But the initial reaction was yelling, which might have been too much. The sister's perspective is important here. If she didn't know the value, the author's anger might be seen as disproportionate. The author could have handled it calmly, maybe explained the situation without yelling. \n\nHowever, the author did take steps to fix the situation by apologizing. So maybe it's a mix, but the question is whether they were in the wrong. Since the sister made a mistake without malicious intent, yelling was probably unnecessary. The author's reaction caused a bigger rift than the issue itself. So the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for overreacting. But some might argue that the author had a right to be upset about losing money. However, the key is the sister's intention. Since she didn't know, the author should have handled it more maturely. So I think the answer is A.\n"
