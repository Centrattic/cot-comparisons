My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over $45 cough drops. The situation involves the sister eating the cough drops that the author had sold on eBay, leading to a fallout where the sister left for college and hasn't spoken since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the value of the item. $45 isn't a huge amount, but for someone who makes money through eBay, it could be significant. However, the sister didn't realize the value and just ate them because she liked the taste. That shows an honest mistake rather than malicious intent.\n\nThe author's reaction was to yell at their sister, which escalated the situation. Yelling is an aggressive response, especially over something the other person didn't intend to do. The sister's reaction was to leave, which might indicate she felt hurt or overwhelmed by the confrontation. The author did later apologize and drive to her college, which shows they recognized the mistake in their reaction. \n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author might have felt frustrated, but losing their temper over a friend or family member's honest mistake could be seen as disproportionate. The key factors here are intent and the response's severity. The sister had no ill intent, and the author's yelling might have been an overreaction given the circumstances. \n\nAdditionally, the author decided not to make their sister pay for replacing the cough drops, which is a sign of understanding the mistake. However, the initial yelling caused a rift. The buyer gave a 3-star review after being informed, which adds to the author's regret but doesn't change the fact that their outburst was the main issue here.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the sister made a mistake by eating the items, the author's response was harsh and could be considered wrong. The situation could have been handled calmly, emphasizing the importance of communication. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their reaction, even if they later made amends.\n"
