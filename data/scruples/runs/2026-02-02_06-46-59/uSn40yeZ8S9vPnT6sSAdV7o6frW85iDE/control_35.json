My sister went back to her college and hasn\u2019t talked to me since.\n\n: I buy and sell designer clothing/accessories on eBay on auction. Somehow an auction I was running for supreme cough drops had reached 45$ by the time it ended. I was pretty happy about this since I made around 35$ in profit. I went to my closet where I keep all my stuff but after digging around I couldn\u2019t find the cough drops. I basically searched my room up and down but I couldn\u2019t find them.it wasn\u2019t until I was walking past my sisters room I saw the mangled box on her dresser. When she came home I confronted her about this and she said that she ate them because \u201cI dunno I just like the taste of them.\u201d \nI yelled at her a lot after that about how she should get her own stuff and how someone expects me to deliver this to them. I guess she got shooken up about this because the next day her car was gone and she had gone back to college (this was during Christmas break).\n\nI feel like it all wasn\u2019t worth it for 35 bucks\n\nEdit 1: holy shit this blew up.  I want to thank everyone who gave me advice because tomorrow I\u2019m going to drive out to her college. I\u2019ll keep you guys updated.\n\nEdit 2: I drove down and apologized, but not without laying down some ground rules.turns out, to her perspective, I was being mean to her over some normal cough drops, she must\u2019ve not known their worth or not see the logo. I\u2019m not going to make her pay to replace them because I believe that it was an honest mistake.\n\nEdit 3: I contacted the buyer and explained the situation. They seemed to understand but gave me a 3 star review. Oof.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their sister over expensive cough drops they sold online. \n\nFirst, the author sold the cough drops for $45 on eBay, making a $35 profit. But their sister ate them without knowing their value. The author got angry, yelled, and the sister left. Later, the author went to apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author overreact? The cough drops had monetary value, but they were consumed by the sister who didn't know they were valuable. The author's reaction was yelling and causing a rift. However, they did apologize and make amends.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to be upset about losing a product they were selling. On the other hand, the sister didn't know their value. The author's yelling seems excessive for the situation, especially considering the relationship. The fact that they took responsibility by visiting the sister shows they realized their mistake. The sister's perspective is important here\u2014she didn't intend to cause harm. \n\nThe author's mistake was losing their temper and causing emotional harm over an item that, while valuable monetarily, isn't something that can be replaced by money in terms of family relations. So, even though the sister ate them unintentionally, the author's reaction led to a significant fallout. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for overreacting and not handling the situation more calmly. But they did take steps to fix it. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and the resulting estrangement, but the resolution shows some accountability. However, the initial action (yelling) is what started the problem. So probably the correct answer is A.\n"
