Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed.\n\nFirst, the driver's main issue is the lack of tips. They mention losing money on the delivery because it's a far location. The customer writes $0.00 each time, so it's not forgetfulness. The driver relies on tips since they make $5 an hour base pay. \n\nNow, the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver wants to report them. But the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nI need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal where they are, then the customer could be breaking the law. But the driver's role is to deliver food, not enforce laws. Reporting someone for personal use might be overstepping. Also, the driver has a financial grievance here, which might be a conflict of interest. \n\nIs the driver allowed to report them? Legally, maybe, but morally, it's a different story. The driver is using the customer's weed use as a reason to report them, but their main issue is the lack of tips. It seems like using the report as a way to get money back, which could be seen as blackmail or extortion. \n\nAlso, the driver's job is to deliver, not to police customers. The customer's choice to use weed is their own, even if it's illegal. The driver might not have the authority to report them unless there's visible evidence of a crime beyond personal use, like selling. But just smelling like weed doesn't prove illegal activity. \n\nSo, the driver might be in the wrong because they're using a personal vendetta (lack of tips) to report someone for something that's their personal choice, even if illegal. Also, the driver's main duty isn't to enforce the law, so they might be overstepping their role. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using their position to report the customer for personal gain rather than a genuine legal concern.\n"
