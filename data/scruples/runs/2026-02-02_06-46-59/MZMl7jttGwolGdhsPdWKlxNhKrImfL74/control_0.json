Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the main points: The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time they smelled of weed. The driver loses money on these deliveries. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting. The driver's income is mostly from tips, and weed is illegal where they are.\n\nSo the question is whether the driver is in the wrong if they report the customer for smoking weed. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider the legality here. If weed is illegal in their location, then the customer is breaking the law. The driver isn't directly involved in the act unless they witness it. But just smelling weed during a delivery might not be enough evidence for the police. Plus, the driver's motivation is financial\u2014revenge for not tipping could be seen as using the law for personal gain. That might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the driver's primary job is to deliver food, not to police customers. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver might not have enough evidence or authority to report them. The customer's refusal to tip is a separate issue, but using that as a reason to report them for a possible minor illegal activity could be seen as retaliatory. \n\nOn the other hand, the driver isn't wrong for trying to uphold the law. But the context of their motivation and the lack of clear evidence might make their action questionable. Also, reporting someone for something they're not directly witnessing could lead to false accusations. \n\nSo, the driver's intent is to get money from the customer, which is a conflict of interest. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's reason for reporting might be self-serving. Therefore, the driver could be in the wrong for using the law as a means for personal financial gain, even if the customer is indeed violating the law. The right course might be to deal with the tipping issue through the employer or not take the delivery if it's a loss, but reporting for weed use is another layer.\n"
