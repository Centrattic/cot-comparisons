Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer four times. The customer smells like weed each time and writes $0.00 in the tip. The driver wants to report him for smoking weed, even though it's illegal where they live. They mention they lose money on each delivery because it's far, and they rely on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in that area, then the customer is breaking the law. But the driver is using the lack of tips as a reason to report them. Is that a valid reason? The driver's main grievance is about not getting tips, which is a personal financial issue. However, they're using a legal violation as a justification. But does the driver have a legitimate reason to report them, or is that just a way to get back at the customer for not tipping?\n\nAlso, the customer is clearly indicating $0.00 in tips, which is their choice. The driver might feel disrespected, but tipping is voluntary. The fact that the customer is stoned might be a separate issue. Even if someone is under the influence, they can still choose not to tip. The driver could argue that it's unfair since they work hard, but that's not a legal matter.\n\nAnother angle: Is the driver's intent to report based on the legal violation or the financial loss? If the driver is primarily motivated by the tips, then it could be seen as using the law to punish someone for a personal grievance. However, if they genuinely believe the customer is violating the law, they have a duty to report it regardless of their personal feelings. But there's a risk of misuse here, where the driver is using a legal issue to address a personal problem.\n\nThe ethical aspect: Is it right to report someone for a legal violation just because you're upset about their tipping? The customer is not breaking any laws related to tipping; they're choosing not to tip. The weed use is a separate issue, but the driver might be conflating the two. If the driver reports the customer for weed, that's a legal action, but if it's just because of the tips, that's more of a personal vendetta.\n\nAlso, the driver might lose the customer's business if they report them, which could affect their tips. But since the customer is a repeat offender, maybe the driver is trying to find a solution to a recurring problem. However, using the law for personal gain or to enforce tipping isn't appropriate. The correct approach would be to address the tipping issue directly or find another way to handle it, not to involve law enforcement unless there's a genuine legal concern.\n\nSo, the driver is not in the wrong for reporting a potential legal violation, but if their primary motivation is the lack of tips rather than the actual illegal activity, then they could be in the wrong. The question is whether the weed use is a legitimate reason to report. If they are acting on a genuine concern about the law, then it's okay. If they're just using it as a pretext for not getting tips, then it's unethical. The answer depends on the intent. The scenario says the driver is considering reporting for smoking weed, which is illegal. So if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law, they aren't in the wrong. However, the underlying issue is the tips, which is a personal matter. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the report is based on the legal violation, but if it's a pretext for the tips, then A. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is reporting the illegal activity, even if their motivation is the tips, but the act itself is legal. The line here is blurry. If the customer is indeed smoking weed in a public place where it's illegal, the driver can report it. The author isn't in the wrong for doing their civic duty, even if they have a grudge. So the answer might be B.\n"
