Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly under the influence of weed. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's consistent failure to tip, and the financial impact on the driver.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. So if the customer is smoking it, that's a potential legal violation. However, the driver's role is to deliver pizza, not to police customers. Reporting someone for a personal drug use, even if it's illegal, could be seen as overstepping. Unless there's a direct threat or public safety issue, it's not typically the driver's responsibility.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer writes $0.00 each time, which the driver finds unfair since they rely on tips. But the customer might have their own reasons for not tipping, even if they're high. The driver's frustration is understandable, especially losing money on the farthest delivery. However, using the customer's drug use as a reason to report them might be conflating two separate issues: the lack of tip and the illegal activity.\n\nThe question is whether the driver is in the wrong. Legally, if the customer is violating the law, the driver isn't necessarily wrong for reporting. But morally, using the tip issue as a motivator for reporting someone's drug use, which they personally don't have a problem with, might be seen as hypocritical or exploiting a legal technicality for personal gain. The driver's main job isn't to enforce drug laws, so it's a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the report is motivated by the tip or genuine concern for illegal activity. If it's the former, the driver could be in the wrong. If the latter, maybe not. But since the user is conflicted and mentions they don't have a problem with weed personally, it suggests the tip issue is the real driver, making the report potentially unethical.\n"
