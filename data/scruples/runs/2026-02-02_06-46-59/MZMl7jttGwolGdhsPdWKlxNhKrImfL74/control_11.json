Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be a bad person for reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed, especially since the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times. The key points here are about legal vs. ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that smoking weed is illegal in their area. So if they believe the customer is using an illegal substance, reporting it could be a legal action. However, there's a nuance here. The user is a delivery driver, so they might not be in a position to confirm if the customer is actually under the influence at the time of delivery. They notice the smell of weed and the customer is stoned, but can they be certain it's from using weed and not something else? Also, the user isn't a law enforcement officer, so reporting someone based on suspicion might be overstepping their role.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer hasn't tipped four times, writing $0.00 each time. The user relies on tips for income, which is a valid concern. But is it right to use a personal financial grievance as a reason to report someone for a possible legal violation? That could be seen as using the law for personal gain, which might not be ethical.\n\nAnother angle: the user's motivation. If the main reason for reporting is revenge for not getting tips, that could be seen as selfish or unethical, even if the act itself is technically legal. The user might be prioritizing their own financial interests over the customer's rights, which could make them an asshole in the eyes of others.\n\nBut legally, if the user reports the customer and the police investigate, that's within their right as a citizen. However, the user might be crossing a line if they're misrepresenting facts or using false pretenses. They need to be sure they have a legitimate reason, not just a grudge.\n\nAlso, the user's argument that they lose money on these deliveries adds another layer. It's understandable that they want fair compensation, but using that as a reason to report someone for a possible minor offense might not be justified. It could lead to unnecessary legal trouble for the customer without a solid basis.\n\nIn summary, while the user is within their rights to report a possible illegal activity, the ethics depend on their intent and the validity of their claims. If they're using the suspicion of weed use as a pretext for not being tipped, then they might be in the wrong. However, if they genuinely believe a crime is occurring and report it in good faith, they might not be. The key factors are the legitimacy of the report and the user's motivation.\n"
