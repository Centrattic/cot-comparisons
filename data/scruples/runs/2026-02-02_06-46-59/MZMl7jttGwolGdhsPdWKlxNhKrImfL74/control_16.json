Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's asking if they're wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and smells like weed. The customer lives far away, so the driver actually loses money each delivery. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the tip issue, and whether reporting the customer is justified.\n\nFirst, the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal where they are. The driver is not okay with that because it's against the law. But the main issue seems to be the lack of tips. The customer intentionally leaves $0.00 each time, which is causing financial loss for the driver. The driver makes $5 an hour and depends on tips.\n\nNow, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer. On one hand, the customer is breaking the law by using an illegal substance. The driver could argue they're just enforcing the law. On the other hand, using the customer's weed use as a reason for not tipping might be seen as taking advantage of a legal situation for personal gain. Also, the driver's main job is to deliver pizza, not to police customers for drug use. \n\nBut the customer is actively choosing not to tip, which is their right. The driver might feel wronged, but the act of not tipping isn't illegal. Reporting someone for not tipping and for drug use could be seen as a misuse of legal resources. The driver's motivation is financial gain rather than a genuine concern for public safety. \n\nSo, the driver isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's questionable. They might be using a legal issue as a pretext to get money from the customer. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the driver has a right to report illegal activity, but others might argue it's using the law for personal benefit. However, since the weed use is illegal, reporting it isn't inherently wrong. The tips are a separate issue. The main problem is the driver's intent to use the report to get tips, which complicates things. But legally, if the user is correct that weed is illegal, then reporting is acceptable. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
