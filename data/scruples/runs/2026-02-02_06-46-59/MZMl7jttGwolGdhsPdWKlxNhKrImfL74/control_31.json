Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time stoned and smelling of weed. The driver is losing money on each delivery because it's a far location. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip, not forgetting. The driver makes $5/hour and relies on tips.\n\nThe key points here are: the legality of reporting someone for smoking weed, the ethics of reporting a repeat non-tipper, and whether the driver's actions are justified.\n\nIn the US, cannabis is illegal federally but legal in some states. The question mentions it's illegal where the author lives, so if the customer is using it, that's a legal issue. But does the driver have the right to report them? As a private citizen, you can report crimes, but there's a difference between observing and reporting. However, the main issue is the customer not tipping.\n\nThe driver is considering reporting the customer for non-tipping (which isn't a crime) and for the weed use (which might be). But the problem is the driver's motivation is primarily about the tips. They might be using the weed as an excuse. Even if it's legal, the customer isn't tipping, so the driver wants to retaliate. \n\nIs it ethical to report someone for not tipping, using a legal matter as a pretext? That's where the ethics come in. The driver is a delivery person, not a law enforcement officer. Reporting someone for personal gain (to get tips) might be seen as misuse of the reporting system. Also, the customer is within their rights to not tip, even if it's customary. The driver can't force tips. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong in terms of legal reporting if weed is illegal, but ethically, it's questionable because the primary motive is about tips. However, depending on the jurisdiction, the act of reporting someone for their legal consumption (if it's allowed) would be wrong. If weed is illegal there, the report is valid, but if the main reason is revenge over tips, that's a different issue. But the user is in a place where weed is illegal, so the report is legal. However, using that as an excuse for non-tipping could be seen as a misuse of the system. \n\nBut the user isn't wrong legally, but ethically maybe. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on legal vs ethical. Since the question is about being in the wrong, which is a moral judgment. So, if the author reports the customer primarily for not tipping and uses the weed as an excuse, that's ethically wrong. But if the author genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law, then it's not wrong. The user says they're not against weed but it's illegal. So the motivation is mixed. But the main driver is the lack of tips. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is within their rights to report a possible crime, but ethically it's a gray area. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which is a moral judgment. The answer is B.\n"
