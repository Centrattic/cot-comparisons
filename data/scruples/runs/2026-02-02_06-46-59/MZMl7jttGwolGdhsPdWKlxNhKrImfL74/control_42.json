Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver wants to report them. But here's the catch: just because someone is smoking weed doesn't mean the driver can report them without probable cause. The driver isn't a police officer; they can't just call the police on someone for being high. Unless there's visible consumption or public use, which might be different. But the customer's behavior, like smelling of weed and appearing stoned, doesn't necessarily constitute a crime unless they're using it in a prohibited place. So the driver might be overstepping if they report based on that.\n\nNext, the tipping issue. The customer consistently tips $0, and the driver makes minimum wage plus tips. The driver is losing money on each delivery because of the distance. But the customer isn't legally obligated to tip, even if they write $0.00. The driver's job isn't to police tipping; that's between the customer and their own choices. However, the driver is in a tough spot financially. But is reporting for not tipping justified? Not really. The driver can't force payment or report someone for not giving a tip. That's not a crime either.\n\nEthically, the driver is frustrated and trying to make ends meet. But using the police to address a customer not tipping is a misuse of the legal system. The driver should maybe take other steps, like adjusting the delivery route if possible, or not accepting the order if the customer doesn't tip, but that's not in the question. The main issue is whether reporting is the right move.\n\nIn summary, the driver's motivation is financial distress, but the methods chosen (reporting for not tipping and possible weed use) are not legally valid. So the answer is B, the driver is not in the wrong, but the actions are not appropriate. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not in the wrong, then B. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering the report. Since the author is not in the wrong, but the action is still questionable, the answer would be B.\n"
