Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is a delivery driver who's been not tipped by a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed each time and the driver thinks they're high. The driver is wondering if reporting them for smoking weed is wrong.\n\nFirst, the main points: The customer didn't tip four times, explicitly put $0.00, and the driver loses money on those deliveries. The driver's wage is low ($5/hour), so tips are crucial. The customer's weed use is illegal where they live. The driver is considering reporting them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to consider the ethics here. The driver is upset about not receiving tips, which is their main source of income. The customer is choosing not to tip, possibly due to being high, but it's not clear if the weed use is the reason for not tipping. However, the driver is considering reporting the customer for an illegal activity (smoking weed) as a way to get them to tip. \n\nIs this a valid reason to report someone? The driver's motivation is financial gain, which might not be a good reason to report a crime. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver is using that as a means to an end\u2014getting a tip. That could be seen as using the law for personal benefit, which is unethical. Also, the customer's weed use is a separate issue from not tipping. The driver might be conflating two issues here. \n\nAnother angle: the customer's decision not to tip is their choice, even if it's unkind. The driver can't force the customer to tip by reporting them for something else. That's not how the law works. The police are there to enforce laws, not to punish people for not tipping. So, if the driver reports the customer for weed use, it's a legitimate crime, but the driver's intent is questionable. \n\nAlso, there's a power imbalance here. The customer is a regular, and the driver might be in a vulnerable position with low wages. But the act of reporting someone for a crime is a serious decision and should be based on genuine concern for the law, not personal gain. \n\nIn terms of ethics, using someone else's illegal activity as leverage to get a tip is manipulative. The driver could be seen as exploiting the situation for their own benefit, which makes them an asshole. The customer is breaking the law regardless of tips, but the driver's action is driven by the tip issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using the customer's illegal activity as a means to get a tip, which is unethical and not a valid reason for reporting someone to the police.\n"
