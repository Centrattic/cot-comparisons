Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer is high on weed each time and leaves a $0 tip. The author is considering reporting them because it's illegal where they live. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking about this.\n\nHmm. Well, the key points here are the legality of weed, the tip issue, and the motivation behind the report. The user mentioned that weed is illegal in their area, so if the customer is using it, that's a criminal act. The author is not the police, so they can report what they observe, but do they have the right to do so for a tip?\n\nBut the author's main incentive here seems to be the lack of tips. They rely on tips, especially for longer deliveries where they lose money. So is it ethical to report someone for not tipping? That's a different matter. The police are supposed to enforce laws, not act on someone's personal grievances about service or payment. Even if the customer is using weed, unless the author has clear evidence and is reporting it for the law to handle, not for revenge over tips, maybe it's okay. But the main issue here is that the author is using the weed use as leverage for a tip, which could be seen as a misuse of reporting. \n\nAlso, the user says they don't have a problem with weed personally, so they're not against its use, just the illegality. But if the customer is using it in their home, which is a private matter unless there's a public violation. Maybe the author is overstepping by reporting for personal gain. \n\nSo, if the author reports the customer primarily because of the tips, that's a conflict of interest. The right thing would be to report if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law, regardless of the tip. But if the tip is the main motivator, that's a problem. The author is in a position to report but should consider if their intent is appropriate. \n\nIn terms of the law, the customer's weed use is a separate issue. The author's actions might be within their right, but morally, using that as a way to get tips is wrong. So, the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because they're using a legal issue to address a personal financial grievance, which is unethical.\n"
