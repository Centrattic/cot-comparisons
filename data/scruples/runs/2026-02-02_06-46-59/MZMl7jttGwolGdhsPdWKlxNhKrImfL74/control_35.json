      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer four times. The customer is always stoned and smells like weed, and the user thinks it's illegal there. They're wondering if they're an asshole for reporting the customer to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their area, then using it is against the law. The customer is clearly using it, as the driver notices the smell each time. The driver isn't targeting them for the weed itself but because they didn't tip, right? Wait, but the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for reporting the weed use. \n\nBut wait, the driver's main issue is the lack of tips. They mention that the customer writes $0.00, so it's intentional. The driver loses money on each delivery to this person. So maybe the driver is upset about the tips and using the weed as an excuse to report them. \n\nNow, the ethical angle: Is it right to report someone's legal or illegal activity just because you're mad about tips? Even if the customer is doing something illegal, the driver's motivation here is financial. If the customer is indeed breaking the law by smoking weed, then the driver might have a point in reporting them. But maybe the driver is conflating the two issues\u2014tips and weed use. \n\nBut in some places, weed might be legal. The user says it's illegal where they live, so that's a key point. The customer is committing an illegal act (if they're consuming it on the spot, maybe). However, the driver's role is to report that, but their primary grievance is the lack of tips. \n\nAlso, the driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. That's pretty low, so maybe the tips are crucial for their income. But is it right to report someone for not tipping? The user is considering reporting the customer for both not tipping and for smoking weed. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nThe main issue here is the justification for the report. If the driver is motivated by the customer's refusal to tip, then using the weed as a pretext might be problematic. However, if the weed use is a legitimate illegal activity, then reporting it isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut perhaps the customer is in their own home. If the driver can see them smoking weed through the window or smell it when they deliver, then it's possible. However, unless the driver has a reason to believe the customer is violating another law (like public consumption if that's illegal), maybe it's not the driver's place to report that. \n\nSo, the driver's intent is to get tips. Reporting someone's personal drug use because they don't tip could be seen as crossing a line. The police might not take it seriously if it's just a tip issue. Therefore, the driver might be overstepping by using the weed as a reason to report the customer, when their real motive is the lack of tips. That would make them the asshole because they're using a legal matter as a way to retaliate against non-payment of tips. \n\nBut if the customer is doing something illegal (like smoking in a restricted area), then the driver might have a right to report that. However, since the main issue is the tips, the driver is mixing motives. In that case, the driver is using the law as a means to enforce something else, which could be considered wrong. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that the customer is one of the farthest deliveries, so they lose money each time. The financial impact is real, and maybe the tips are essential. But does that justify reporting someone for a drug-related offense? It's a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, people who report others for such reasons might be seen as the asshole, especially if the report is based on a personal grievance rather than a genuine concern for illegal activity. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). However, if the weed use is indeed illegal and the driver is a concerned citizen, then maybe not. But the primary motivation here seems to be the tips. \n\nI think the key is that the author is using the illegal drug use as a reason to retaliate against someone who's not tipping, which is a personal financial issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
