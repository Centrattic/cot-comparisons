Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a pizza delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for not tipping, and the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver mentions that the customer doesn't tip, which affects their income since they rely on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If smoking weed is illegal where they live, then the customer could be breaking the law. The driver is thinking about reporting them for not tipping but also notes the customer smells like weed. However, the primary reason for the report is the lack of tipping, not the drug use. But maybe the driver is using the drug use as a justification for reporting. \n\nBut wait, can someone be reported for not tipping? Tipping is customary but not legally required in many places. So the driver can't report the customer to the police for not tipping. That's a civil matter, not a criminal one. The driver's job is to deliver pizza, and the customer's failure to tip is a business issue, not a criminal offense. So reporting the customer to the police for not tipping would be inappropriate. \n\nHowever, if the driver noticed the customer using illegal drugs, that's a different matter. But the driver isn't reporting the drug use; they're focusing on the tipping. The driver might be conflating the two issues. Even if the customer is using drugs, the driver shouldn't report them for that unless there's a clear intent to involve law enforcement in a non-emergency. \n\nAlso, the driver's financial situation is tough because they make $5 an hour and rely on tips. But that doesn't justify misusing the police system for a non-criminal issue. The driver is in a difficult position, but using the police to address a civil or business issue is wrong. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because reporting a customer for not tipping is not a valid reason to involve law enforcement. The correct course of action would be to address the tipping issue through the employer or customer service, not the police. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
