Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a pizza delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed each time and writes $0.00 in the tip. The driver is considering reporting them for smoking weed, even though they personally don't have an issue with it. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's deliberate no-tipping, and the driver's financial reliance on tips.\n\nFirst, the legality: if weed is illegal where they are, then the customer is indeed breaking the law. The driver isn't the police, but they might have a right to report illegal activity. However, the main motivation here is the lack of tips. The customer isn't just forgetting; they're intentionally not tipping. The driver is losing money on these far deliveries and depends on tips for income. \n\nNow, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for potentially reporting the customer. Even if the customer's weed use is illegal, using that as a reason to report them might be a stretch if the driver's primary grievance is the lack of tips. The driver could be conflating two separate issues. Legally, the customer's actions (using an illegal substance) are one thing, but the driver's right to be paid through tips is another. The driver can't force the customer to tip, but they can take it as a business decision, like avoiding that route if possible. However, using the law to address a service issue might be overstepping. \n\nAlso, the driver's personal opinion on weed not being a problem adds context. They're not reporting out of concern for the customer's well-being but out of frustration over lost income. This could be seen as using a legal violation as a pretext for a personal grievance. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the driver is in a tough spot. They rely on tips, which are part of the service industry's compensation. Customers not tipping is unethical, but it's not illegal. Reporting the customer for a legal transgression (weed use) when the main issue is the tip might be seen as exploiting the law for personal gain. So, the driver might be in the wrong if their primary motivation is the lack of tips rather than enforcing the law. \n\nHowever, if the driver genuinely believes the customer is violating the law, they have a right to report it. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the report is based on the weed use, which is illegal, then technically they aren't in the wrong for reporting a crime. But the situation is more nuanced because the driver's main issue is the loss of income, not the illegal activity itself. This could lead others to perceive the driver as using the law to get what they want, which might be considered unethical. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the primary motivation. If the driver is primarily upset about the tips and uses the weed as an excuse, then they might be in the wrong. If they're genuinely concerned about the illegal activity, then they aren't. Given the context, the driver's frustration with the tips is the main driver for the report, so they might be in the wrong.\n"
