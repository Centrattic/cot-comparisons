Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer didn't tip them multiple times and was smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The customer always leaves a $0.00 tip, and the driver feels they lose money on each delivery because it's a far location.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer for smoking weed. Even if the customer is smoking an illegal substance, the driver is a private citizen. In many places, citizens can report illegal activities they observe, but there are nuances. However, the driver's motivation here isn't just about the law\u2014it's also about the lack of tips and financial loss. \n\nThe key point is the intent and the proportionality of the action. The customer's actions (not tipping) are a separate issue from smoking weed. The driver is using the customer's illegal activity as a means to retaliate for not receiving tips. That could be seen as misuse of the legal system, which is more about enforcing the law rather than personal grievances. \n\nAlso, the driver's livelihood depends on tips, which the customer is choosing not to give. But reporting someone for not tipping isn't a crime, even if the customer is smoking weed. The driver might be conflating two separate issues: the customer's choice to not tip and their choice to use an illegal substance. \n\nMoreover, there's a question of whether the driver has a valid reason to report the customer. If the driver is just using their presence as a delivery person to monitor the customer's activities, that's a stretch. The police might not take such a report seriously if it's clear the driver is motivated by financial gain rather than genuine concern for breaking the law. \n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of privacy. If the driver is entering the customer's residence, maybe they can observe the weed smell, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have a right to report it unless they have evidence. However, in this case, the driver might have observed the smell during delivery, but that's not conclusive proof. \n\nSo, putting this all together: the driver is considering reporting someone for a personal reason (not getting tips) and using the illegal activity as a pretext. That could be seen as unethical or even an abuse of the reporting system. The customer's choice to not tip is their own, even if it's frustrating. The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, not to enforce laws unless they have a legitimate reason. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong because their action is retaliatory and not a genuine public safety concern.\n"
