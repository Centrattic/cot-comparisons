Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The author is a delivery driver who's losing money on these deliveries because the customer is far away. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time, the author notices the customer is stoned and smells like weed. The author is considering reporting them because smoking weed is illegal where they live. But the author also mentions they don't have a problem with it personally, just that it's against the law.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in that area, then the customer could be breaking the law by smoking it. The author's intention is to report them for that, but the main motive here might be the lack of tips and the financial loss. The key here is whether the author is using the weed-smoking as a pretext to report someone for not tipping them adequately. That's a common ethical issue\u2014using a legal issue as a cover for personal grievances.\n\nThe author's main complaint is about not receiving tips. The question is whether they are justified in reporting the customer for an unrelated illegal activity to get back at them for not tipping. Even if the customer is indeed breaking the law, the author's primary motivation seems to be revenge or financial compensation, not genuine concern for the law. That could make the author in the wrong because they're using the law as a tool for personal gain rather than upholding justice.\n\nAlso, as a delivery driver, the author's job is to deliver the pizza, not to enforce laws. They might not have the authority or responsibility to police customers' activities unless they are directly involved in illegal activities that affect them, like violence or theft. Reporting someone for smoking weed, which is a personal choice and possibly a civil violation, might be overstepping their role unless there's a direct safety concern.\n\nHowever, if the customer is indeed violating the law, the author isn't legally obligated to report it, but if they do, it's their right. But the ethical question is whether holding a grudge over tips is a valid reason to report someone. It sounds like the author is using the weed-smoking as an excuse to retaliate against the customer for not tipping. That's where the ethical issue lies\u2014using the law to settle a personal score.\n\nIn many places, tipping is a social norm but not legally required, so customers can choose to tip or not. The author's financial situation being tied to tips is part of the gig economy structure, but that doesn't mean customers can be reported for not tipping. The real issue is the author's motivation. If they're reporting the customer primarily because of the tips and using the weed as a pretext, that's unethical. If they genuinely believe the customer is violating the law and report them without ulterior motives, that's a different scenario. But based on the context provided, the author's main grievance is the lack of tips and financial loss, so their motivation is questionable.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong for considering reporting the customer as a form of retaliation for not tipping, even if the customer is smoking weed illegally. The ethical thing would be to address the tipping issue directly (maybe through the employer or platform if it's part of their policy) rather than using the law as a weapon. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
