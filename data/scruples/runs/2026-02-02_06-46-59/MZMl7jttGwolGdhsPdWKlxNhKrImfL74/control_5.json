Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer is smoking weed each time, which is illegal where they live. The driver is considering reporting them for this. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the customer is not tipping, which affects the driver's income since they rely on tips. The customer writes $0.00 intentionally, not forgetting. The driver also mentions losing money on these deliveries due to distance. The customer is under the influence of an illegal substance during the deliveries.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: if weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. The driver wants to report this. But the question is about whether the driver is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the driver is being paid under the table (as many gig workers are) and depends on tips. Not getting tips is a financial hit. Reporting someone for a non-violent, personal activity might be seen as using the law against someone for a minor violation. However, the customer is indeed committing a crime by using an illegal substance.\n\nBut is the driver justified in reporting them? There's an argument that the driver is trying to enforce the law, which they have the right to do. However, others might see this as using the legal system to retaliate for not getting tips, especially if the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips. \n\nThe key here is the intent. If the driver's primary reason is to get the customer to tip, then it's more about revenge or coercion. But if they're genuinely concerned about illegal activity, then it's a legal duty. The problem is that the driver might be using the illegal activity as a pretext for their personal financial grievance. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some people might think the driver is overstepping by using a legal system to enforce personal financial gain. Others might say that if someone is breaking the law, it's their civic duty to report it regardless of personal feelings. However, the driver's situation is that they're not being paid adequately, which is a separate issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they report the customer primarily to get a tip, then yes, they're misusing the legal system. But if they're genuinely concerned about illegal use, then no. The context suggests that the lack of tips is a significant motivator here, given the mention of financial loss. Therefore, the answer might hinge on the intent. Since the user is asking if they're an asshole for reporting, the community might lean towards A, that they are in the wrong because of the motive.\n"
