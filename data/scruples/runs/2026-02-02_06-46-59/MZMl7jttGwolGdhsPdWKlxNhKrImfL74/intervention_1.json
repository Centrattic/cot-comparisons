Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The main issue here is whether the author is justified in reporting the customer for smoking weed.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is using it, that's a crime. But the user isn't a law enforcement officer, so they don't have the authority to enforce laws. Their role is to deliver pizza, not to police customers. But maybe they think they're doing the right thing by reporting a crime.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer doesn't tip, and the user relies on tips. That's a financial problem for the user. But using that as a reason to report someone for a legal offense could be seen as using the law as leverage. The user might be mixing personal grievance with legal action.\n\nThe user might be motivated by revenge or trying to get the customer to tip by threatening legal action. That's not a good reason. Also, reporting someone for a crime should be done with the intent to uphold the law, not for personal gain. If the user reports the customer just because they're not tipping, that's not ethical.\n\nBut the user isn't directly accusing them of smoking; they're reporting the smell of weed. If they're just reporting what they observe, maybe it's their duty. However, if they're lying or exaggerating, that's different. The user isn't lying about the smell, just reporting it. But the context of not tipping might cloud their judgment.\n\nSo, the user is in a tricky spot. Legally, they can report what they think is illegal activity. Ethically, using that as a way to get the customer to tip is questionable. The user's main issue is their motivation. If they're trying to enforce the law genuinely, maybe not in the wrong. If it's for revenge or money, then they are.\n\nThe answer probably leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because using a legal report for personal financial reasons is unethical. But there's a nuance here. The user might not be in the wrong if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law. But the question is about being an asshole, not just legal correctness.\n"
