Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The driver says the customer hasn't tipped four times, each time the person was stoned and smelled of weed. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips, and delivering to this customer is costly.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: weed is illegal where they live. So, if the customer is using it, that's technically a crime. The driver wants to report them for that. But is it the driver's place to do so? The driver's job is to deliver pizza; their duty isn't to police customers for drug use. However, if the driver notices illegal activity, maybe they have a duty to report it. But usually, people are supposed to report crimes even if they're not directly affected. However, the driver's motivation here is also about the tips. They mention losing money each delivery and the customer intentionally tips $0.00. So, there's a financial motive mixed with the legal issue.\n\nThe question is whether the driver is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might see it differently. If the driver reports the customer because of the weed use, that's a legal matter. But if the driver is using the weed as an excuse because the customer isn't tipping, that could be seen as misuse of the law. Maybe there's a conflict of interest here. The driver's primary job is to deliver, not to enforce laws unless they notice something more dangerous. If the customer is just smoking weed, which is a non-violent crime, the driver might be overstepping. Also, the customer's choice to not tip is separate from drug use. The driver might feel wronged by the lack of tips, but that's a different issue. So, the driver's intent here could be a mix of both issues, but using the law to retaliate for not getting tips might be unethical. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because the driver is using the legal system to address a personal grievance (lack of tips) rather than a genuine concern for enforcing the law.\n"
