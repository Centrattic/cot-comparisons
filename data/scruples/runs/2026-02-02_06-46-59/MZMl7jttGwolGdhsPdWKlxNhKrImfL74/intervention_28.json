Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who wants to report a customer for smoking weed multiple times because they didn't tip them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer is breaking the law. But the author is a delivery driver, not a law enforcer. Their job is to deliver pizza, not to police customers. So even if the customer is smoking weed, the author isn't supposed to report them just for that. Unless there's a direct threat or safety issue, but the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nThen there's the tipping aspect. The customer didn't tip four times, and the author relies on tips. But not tipping is a separate issue. The author might be upset about the lack of tips, but using the weed as a reason to report the customer seems like a stretch. The author's main grievance is the lack of tips, but they're using the weed as a justification. That could be seen as a pretext. They might be looking for an excuse to retaliate against the customer who doesn't tip.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's intentional. But reporting someone for not tipping isn't something the police handle. The author is not in a position to enforce tipping laws. The appropriate action would be to maybe address it with the employer or not go on the route if it's affecting their income, but not to involve the police.\n\nEthically, using the weed as a reason to report someone just because they didn't tip seems wrong. The author is conflating two issues: the customer's lawful choice (if they're in a place where it's legal) or their illegal activity with the author's frustration over tips. Even if weed is illegal, the author isn't in a position to report someone unless there's an immediate threat. The author is not a law enforcement officer, so they don't have the authority to make such reports based on their own observations.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using the customer's personal choices as a reason to retaliate over unpaid tips. The proper channels for addressing tip concerns would be through the employer or customer service, not involving the police over a non-emergency.\n"
