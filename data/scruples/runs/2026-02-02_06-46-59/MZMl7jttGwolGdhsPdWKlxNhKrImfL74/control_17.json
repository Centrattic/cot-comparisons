Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer smells like weed each time and explicitly puts $0.00 in the tip. The driver lives in a place where weed is illegal. They're considering reporting the customer for smoking weed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the driver is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether it's appropriate to report someone for using an illegal substance based on the premise of not tipping. \n\nThe driver's main grievance is lack of tips. They mention that the customer writes $0.00, so it's intentional. The driver is losing money on these deliveries. However, the driver is using the customer's possible drug use as a reason to report them. \n\nBut here's the catch: the driver can't prove that the customer is using an illegal substance. They can smell weed, but that's not proof. The customer might be using legal products that smell similar, or maybe the smell is from earlier. The driver doesn't have evidence beyond their own perception.\n\nAlso, the legality of weed varies. The user says it's illegal where they live, but in some places, recreational or medical use might be legal. The driver might not know the customer's status. Even if it's illegal, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer. Reporting someone for a suspected crime without evidence could lead to false accusations. \n\nThe driver's motivation is the lack of tips. Using the weed as a pretext to get the customer banned or fined might be a misuse of the reporting process. The proper way to address tipping is to talk to the customer directly or bring it up with the employer. Reporting for a non-tipping issue is a different matter.\n\nSo, the driver is conflating two issues: the customer's choice to not tip and the possible drug use. Reporting someone for drug use without evidence is not the right approach. The driver's actions would be inappropriate because they're using a legal issue as a way to address a financial grievance. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
