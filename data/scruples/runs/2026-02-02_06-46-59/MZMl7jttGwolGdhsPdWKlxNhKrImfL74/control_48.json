Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is using weed. First, the main issue here is whether reporting the customer is justified.\n\nThe customer isn't tipping multiple times, and the driver feels it's because the customer is stoned and smells like weed. The driver makes minimum wage and relies on tips. The customer explicitly writes $0.00 in the tip, so it's not a forgetful mistake. The driver is losing money on these far deliveries.\n\nNow, the legal part: if weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is indeed breaking the law. However, just being high isn't a crime unless caught in the act. The driver is using the customer's possible drug use as the reason to report them for not tipping. But is that a valid reason?\n\nEthically, the driver is upset about lost tips. They need to consider if reporting is a form of revenge for not getting a tip. Legally, they might need proof of illegal activity, not just the smell of weed. Privacy is another angle\u2014can a delivery driver report someone just because they suspect drug use?\n\nAlso, the driver's intent is a factor. Are they trying to enforce the law, or are they seeking to punish the customer for not tipping? The latter could be seen as vindictive. The customer's actions (no tip) are separate from their drug use. So, the driver mixing these two issues might be the problem. Even if the customer is using drugs illegally, the driver's real grievance is about the lack of tip, which is a separate matter.\n\nIn summary, the driver isn't in the wrong for feeling wronged by the lack of tips, but reporting the customer for drug use as a result of that grievance could be seen as crossing a line. The driver's primary motivation is financial gain, not public safety, which affects the morality of the action.\n"
