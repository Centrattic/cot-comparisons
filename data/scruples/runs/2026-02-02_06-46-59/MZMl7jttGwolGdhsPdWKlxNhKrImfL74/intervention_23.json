Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a delivery driver who makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The customer has not tipped four times, and each time the customer is stoned and smells of weed. The author is considering reporting them because possession or consumption of weed is illegal in their area. The customer's tip section is set to $0, so it's not a forgetful mistake. The author feels like they lose money on each delivery to this customer.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nLet me start by considering the legal aspect. If the customer is using illegal substances, which the author believes is the case, then reporting them could be a civic duty. However, the author might be overstepping if they're using this as a reason for not getting tipped. But the author's main issue is lack of tips, which is separate from the weed use. \n\nThe ethical angle here is tricky. The author's job is to deliver the pizza, which they do on time and correctly. The customer's choice to use weed is their own, even if it's illegal. The author is in a position where they can observe this and report it. But is it their responsibility to do so? \n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The author relies on tips, and this customer isn't contributing. The author might feel wronged, but using the weed use as a justification for reporting could be seen as a way to get the tip they want. Is that fair? Could it be considered a form of extortion or misuse of power?\n\nAlso, the author is in a service role. The customer's behavior might affect the delivery (like being stoned and not tipping), but the author's response is to report the person for an illegal act. The line between personal ethics and legal action is blurred here.\n\nIn some cases, people might report illegal activities they witness, even if they have a personal grievance. However, if the main motive is to get a tip, that could be problematic. It might be seen as using the law to settle a personal score rather than genuine concern for the law.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a delivery driver, not a law enforcement officer. Their duty is to deliver the product, not to police their customers. However, they are a citizen, so they have the right to report crimes if they believe they're being committed. \n\nBut the question is whether it's the right thing to do. If the author reports the customer primarily because they're not tipping, that's a different motive than if they genuinely believe a crime is being committed. The smell of weed might be a sign of illegal activity, but the author isn't sure. They assume the customer is smoking weed, but could be mistaken. Also, in some places, possession is illegal, but maybe public consumption is a civil violation. The author might be jumping to conclusions.\n\nConsidering the user's own analysis, they think the author is in the wrong. They might be suggesting that the author should focus on the tipping issue rather than report for the weed use. The author's motive could be mixed, using the weed as an excuse to get the tip they expect. That could be seen as taking advantage of their position to exert control over the customer, which isn't right.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed violating the law by using weed, then the author is acting as a responsible citizen. The tipping issue is separate. However, the author's reliance on tips is part of their income, and the customer's refusal to tip is a separate issue. The author might feel that the customer's behavior is connected (being high leads to not tipping), but that's a personal assumption.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: if the author's primary motive is to get a tip, then using the weed as a reason to report the customer is wrong. If the author is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, then it's right. But since the author's main complaint is the lack of tips, and the report is a way to address that, it might be in the wrong. The author could be using the law to get what they want, which is unethical.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using a personal grievance as a reason to report a customer for an illegal activity they observed, which could be seen as misuse of their position.\n"
