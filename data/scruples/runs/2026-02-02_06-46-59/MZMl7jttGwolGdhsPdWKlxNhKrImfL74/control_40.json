Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for reporting a customer who didn't tip multiple times and was smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is openly smoking it, that's a possible law violation. The user wants to report them for that. So legally, they might have a point.\n\nBut the main issue here is the tipping. The user is a delivery driver making $5 an hour, relying on tips. The customer didn't tip four times, even writing $0.00. That's pretty clear, not just forgetting. The user feels wronged because they lose money on this delivery. \n\nHowever, the user is considering using the weed-smoking as a reason to report the customer. But is their main motivation about the tips? That complicates things. Reporting someone for a legal issue (weed) but being primarily upset about unpaid tips might be seen as using a legal matter for personal gain. \n\nEthically, is it right to report someone for a legal violation even if the main reason is revenge or financial loss? Some might say yes because you should follow the law. Others might say no, because it's using a legal action as retaliation. \n\nAlso, the user's job is to deliver food, not enforce laws. They might not be the best person to report it unless they have evidence. Plus, the customer's weed use might be in private, so the user might not have a legitimate reason to report it unless they're certain.\n\nSo, the user is in a tricky spot. Legally, if the customer is violating the law by smoking weed, the user can report it. But ethically, using that as a pretext for unpaid tips makes them potentially an asshole. The answer depends on whether the user is genuinely concerned about the law or just using it as a way to get back at the customer for not tipping.\n"
