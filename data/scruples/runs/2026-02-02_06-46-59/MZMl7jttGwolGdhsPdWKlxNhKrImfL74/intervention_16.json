Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed during deliveries. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and they mention that the person smells like weed and writes $0.00 as a tip. The driver is upset because they lose money on that delivery and rely on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue is whether the customer's actions (smoking weed) are illegal. The user says it's illegal where they live. So if the customer is smoking weed, that's a law violation. But the user's motivation here is the lack of tips. The customer isn't just not tipping; they're intentionally entering $0.00. The driver is making $5 an hour plus tips, so relying on tips is a big part of their income.\n\nNow, the driver is thinking of reporting the customer for smoking weed. But is the driver's reason for reporting them just to get a tip? That could be a problem. Because even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver might be using that as an excuse to retaliate for not getting a tip. That could be seen as misuse of the reporting process. \n\nAlso, the law enforcement's role is to enforce laws, not to handle disputes over tips. If the driver reports the customer solely because they didn't tip, even if there's an illegal activity, it's questionable. However, the customer is indeed smoking an illegal substance, so there's a real issue there. But the driver might be using the law to get revenge for not getting a tip, which is unethical.\n\nAnother angle: the customer's right to privacy. Just because someone smells like weed doesn't automatically mean they're breaking the law. Maybe they have a medical card or it's legal in some form. The driver can't be certain. Reporting based on smell alone could be a false accusation. \n\nAlso, the fact that the customer writes $0.00 suggests they don't want to tip, which is their right. The driver can't force them to tip. But the driver is in a position where they need tips to make a living, so the lack of tips is a real hardship. However, reporting someone to the police for not tipping is not the right approach. \n\nSo, the driver is using the customer's possible illegal activity as a pretext to address their own financial loss. That's probably in the wrong. The correct action would be to handle the tip issue separately, maybe by talking to the customer or the employer if there's a policy. Reporting to police for this reason is misuse of the system.\n"
