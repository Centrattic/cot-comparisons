Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a pizza delivery driver asking if they're wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The key points here are legality, the user's financial situation, and the customer's actions.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that smoking weed is illegal where they live. If they report the customer for that, then they're doing it to enforce the law. But if they're doing it just because the customer doesn't tip, that's a different matter. The user is in a service job and relies on tips, especially since delivering to this customer is a loss. The customer consistently enters $0.00 as a tip, which the user sees as intentional, not a mistake.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong for reporting the customer. Legally, if the user is reporting accurately about the customer's illegal activity, they might be within their rights. However, their primary motivation seems to be the lack of tips rather than genuine concern about the law. That could be seen as using the law as a tool for personal gain, which might be considered unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, if the user is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, then they're not in the wrong. But the scenario suggests that the user's main issue is the lack of tips, which complicates things. Reporting someone for a minor violation solely because they didn't tip could be seen as an overreaction or using the police to solve a personal financial problem. This might be considered wrong because it's not the right use of law enforcement resources or targeting someone for something they can't control (like their choice to use an illegal substance, even if it's a personal decision).\n\nAlso, the user's financial situation is tough, making them rely on tips. However, that doesn't justify using illegal means to address it. The right approach might be to handle the tip issue through the employer or customer service, not legal reporting. So, the user might be in the wrong for considering a report based on the customer's tipping habits rather than the actual legality of the situation.\n"
