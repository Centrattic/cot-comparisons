Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a delivery driver (the author) considering reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The main points are: the customer hasn't tipped four times, smells like weed, and the author thinks reporting them is justified because they lose money on each delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If smoking weed is illegal where they live, then the customer is breaking the law. However, the author's role is as a delivery driver, not a law enforcer. The author isn't a police officer, so their responsibility isn't to enforce laws. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for reporting someone.\n\nThe author's motivation is twofold: the lack of tips and the customer's illegal activity. They mention that the tips are zero, and they rely on tips for income. So there's a financial incentive here. But is it appropriate to report someone for not tipping? That seems like a separate issue. The customer's choice to not tip is a civil matter, not a criminal one unless it's part of some other law. However, the author is using the illegal weed use as the reason to report them. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is justified in reporting the customer's illegal activity. If the customer is indeed smoking weed illegally, then the author is reporting a crime. However, there's a potential for misuse here. The author might be using the illegal activity as a pretext to retaliate against not receiving tips. That could be problematic because it's not the reason for the report. The police might not take it seriously if they see it as a tip-related complaint disguised as a legal report.\n\nAlso, there's an ethical angle. Is it right to report someone for a personal grievance? Even if the customer is breaking the law, the author's main issue is about tips. The author might be in the wrong if their primary motivation is the lack of tips rather than genuinely reporting a crime. It could be seen as a way to get even, which might be unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is correctly reporting a crime (illegal drug use), they could be doing the right thing regardless of their personal feelings. However, the line between a genuine report and retaliation is thin here. The author's financial loss from delivering to a far location might also be a factor, but that doesn't change the legality of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's primary justification is the illegal activity, but their underlying motive might be the tips. If the report is based on a genuine belief in the crime, they might not be in the wrong. But if it's a way to retaliate over tips, then they are in the wrong. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide which applies.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The main issue is the intent behind the report. If the author is using the illegal activity as a cover to address a personal grievance, then they are misusing the reporting process. Therefore, the answer would be A (in the wrong). However, if they are genuinely concerned about the illegal activity, then B (not in the wrong). Since the author's own statement mentions both the illegal activity and the tip issue, but the question is about their wrongness in reporting, and the fact that they lose money, it's more likely the report is a retaliation. So the answer is A.\n"
