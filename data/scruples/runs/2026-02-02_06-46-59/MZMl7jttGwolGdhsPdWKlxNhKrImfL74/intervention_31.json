Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver who hasn't received tips from a customer multiple times. The customer is always stoned when they meet, and the driver wants to report him for smoking weed. The driver loses money on these deliveries because it's a long distance, and he makes only $5 an hour plus tips. The question is whether the driver is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the intent of the driver and the legality. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal in their state. But the driver's main grievance is about not receiving tips. The driver is considering reporting the customer not just for smoking but specifically because of the lack of tips, which is a financial issue.\n\nNow, the legality of weed is a separate issue from tipping. If the customer is indeed using weed in a way that's illegal (like in public or in a prohibited manner), then technically, the driver could report that. However, the driver's primary motivation here seems to be the lack of tips and the financial loss from the far delivery. Reporting someone for a minor violation (if it's allowed) because they didn't tip could be seen as using the law for personal gain, which is problematic. \n\nAlso, the customer is explicitly selecting a $0.00 tip, not forgetting. That's their choice as a consumer, even if it's frustrating for the driver. The driver's right to be paid for their work is important, but enforcing that through a tip isn't legally binding. Tips are discretionary. The driver's compensation is low, but that's part of the job structure in many service industries.\n\nSo, the driver's intent to report the customer over tips might be seen as a misuse of the reporting system. Unless there's a clear legal violation (like public consumption of weed) that's being ignored, the driver is targeting the customer for a personal financial issue. That could make the driver the asshole here, as they're using a legal issue as a means to get the customer to tip, which isn't a valid reason. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
