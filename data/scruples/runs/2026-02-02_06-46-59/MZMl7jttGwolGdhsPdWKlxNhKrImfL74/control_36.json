Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police. The customer hasn't tipped them four times and seems high on weed each time, which the user notes is illegal in their area. The user mentions that the customer intentionally writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting. They also lose money on each delivery because it's a far location. The user's income relies heavily on tips since they earn $5 an hour base.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. The user is considering reporting this, which is a legal action. However, reporting someone for drug use can have consequences. The user might be seen as an informer, which can damage community trust. But legally, the user isn't required to look the other way. However, the user's primary issue is the lack of tips. Is the user justified in reporting solely for that reason?\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The user's livelihood depends on tips, and the customer is intentionally not tipping. The user isn't just reporting the drug use but also the financial aspect. But using the police as a means to enforce tipping might be seen as exploiting the law for personal gain. However, if the customer is indeed violating the law, the user has a right to report that. But is it right to use that as leverage over not tipping?\n\nAnother angle: The user might face backlash. The customer could retaliate, like avoiding the business or reporting the driver. Also, the police might not take the report seriously unless there's more to it than just drug use and lack of tips. There's also the question of privacy; the driver is reporting personal behavior of the customer that might not be directly relevant to the delivery service.\n\nIn terms of the user's rights: They have the right to report illegal activities. But the user's motivation here is financial, which complicates things. If the user reports the customer, it could be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a genuine concern for law enforcement. The user is in a service job, so their actions could affect future interactions with customers and their reputation within the community.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the customer is indeed violating the law, the user isn't necessarily wrong for reporting. But using the police to get a tip might be crossing a line. The key is whether the user's intent is to enforce the law or to get a tip. If the former, they're not wrong. If the latter, it's more questionable. Since the user mentions they don't have a problem with weed personally but are focused on the financial aspect, their primary motive might be the tips. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for using legal enforcement for personal gain, even if the behavior is illegal. Alternatively, if the report is purely about the illegal activity, then the user isn't wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the user is primarily motivated by the lack of tips and the financial loss, it's possible they're in the wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the main motive is financial gain, using the police as a tool for that, which isn't appropriate.\n"
