Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's wondering if they're an asshole (WIBTA) for considering reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and each time they smelled weed. The driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting it while high. The driver loses money on these deliveries because it's a far location, and they rely on tips.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the user cites that weed is illegal where they live. So, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the user could argue they're reporting a crime. But is the smell of weed enough? Police might need more evidence than just an odor. Also, the user is using this as a reason for the lack of tips. The user might be conflating two issues: not tipping and illegal activity. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is a delivery driver who relies on tips. Not getting tipped is frustrating, especially if it's a far delivery. But is it their role to police customers? Maybe they feel wronged and see this as a way to get justice for the lack of tips. However, reporting someone for using an illegal substance could be seen as using the law as a weapon when they're upset about money. \n\nEthically, is it right to report someone for something that's their personal choice (even if illegal) just because they didn't tip? The user isn't harmed beyond financial loss, which could be considered a business issue rather than a legal one. Also, the user might be overstepping their role as a delivery driver to enforce the law. \n\nThe user's reasoning could be self-serving. They want to get tips, so they're using the presence of weed as a reason to report him. But if they just didn't tip, would they report them? Maybe not. So, the motivation here might be more about the tips than the weed use. \n\nConsidering all this, the user is using a legal issue as a pretext for a personal grievance about not getting tips. That makes them the asshole for using the law to settle a business dispute rather than addressing it directly, like talking to the customer or the pizza place about the tips. Reporting someone for an illegal activity should be based on genuine concern for the law, not revenge or financial gain. So, the user is in the wrong.\n"
