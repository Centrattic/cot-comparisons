Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's wondering if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and is clearly high on weed. The key points here are: the customer hasn't tipped four times, the driver loses money on those deliveries, and the customer is under the influence of an illegal substance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their location, then the customer's actions are indeed illegal. However, the main issue here is whether the driver should report someone for not tipping and being high. The driver's job is to deliver the food, and the customer isn't violating any laws by not tipping. Tipping is a social norm but not a legal requirement. So, the driver is upset because of financial loss due to not receiving tips, which is a valid personal frustration but not a legal issue.\n\nNow, the question of whether the driver is in the wrong for considering a report. The driver is using the customer's illegal activity as a reason to report them, but the real motivation seems to be the lack of tips. This could be seen as a misuse of the reporting process. The police are meant to address legal violations, not personal grievances. So, by reporting the customer for a legal issue (smoking weed) as a way to get back at them for not tipping, the driver is using a legal justification for a personal vendetta. That would make the driver in the wrong because they're exploiting a legal problem to address a non-legal issue.\n\nAdditionally, the driver's livelihood depends on tips, which is understandable. However, retaliating against a customer for not tipping by reporting them for an unrelated illegal activity is not appropriate. The driver should address the tipping issue through other means, like discussing it with their employer or the customer, rather than involving the police. Therefore, the driver is in the wrong for considering this action.\n"
