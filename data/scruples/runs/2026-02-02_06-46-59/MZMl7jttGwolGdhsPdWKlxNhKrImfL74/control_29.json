Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who smokes weed and doesn't tip. The author is a delivery driver who loses money on each delivery to this customer. The customer doesn't tip, writes $0.00, and the author is upset because they make minimum wage and rely on tips. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area and the ethics of reporting someone for not tipping.\n\nFirst, the customer isn't tipping, which is common in some service industries, but the author is relying on tips to make a living. However, not tipping is generally a civil issue, not a criminal one. Unless there's a fraud element, like the customer intentionally deceiving the business, it's not illegal. The author's main grievance is about lost income due to the customer's choice to not tip.\n\nThen there's the weed part. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. The author is considering reporting this. But the author is a delivery driver, not a law enforcement officer. It's their job to deliver the pizza, not to monitor customers' activities. Unless the customer is using the delivery service to cover illegal activities that could be dangerous or illegal, like drug dealing, the author isn't responsible for enforcing the law. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer. If the customer is smoking weed in their own home, it's a personal choice, even if illegal. The author's motivation here is to get a tip, not to enforce the law. Using the law as a tool to get money back that's otherwise not owed might be seen as unethical. Also, the author might be overstepping by acting as a snitch for personal gain. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer isn't tipping, which is a separate issue. But the author's approach is to use the illegal weed as leverage, which could be seen as a form of coercion. That's probably not the right way to handle it. The author should instead focus on addressing the tipping issue through appropriate channels, like talking to the customer or the employer, rather than involving the police for a personal grievance.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is using an illegal activity as a means to get what they believe they're owed in tips, which is not the proper approach. They might be in the wrong because they're leveraging a law enforcement response for a personal financial issue, which is not appropriate. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
