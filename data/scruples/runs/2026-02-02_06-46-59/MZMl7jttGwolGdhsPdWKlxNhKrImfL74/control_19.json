Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a pizza delivery driver, and a customer hasn't tipped them four times. Each time, the customer is stoned and smells like weed. The author wants to report them to the police because they think it's illegal where they live. They mention they lose money on each delivery because it's a far place, and the customer intentionally leaves a $0 tip, not just forgetting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer's possession or use of it is against the law. The author is considering reporting this activity, which is a legal matter. However, the author's main grievance is the lack of tips, which is a separate issue. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author is using their job as a reason to report someone for a personal dislike. The main motivation is the lack of tips, not necessarily enforcing the law. The author mentions they make $5 an hour and rely on tips, so this is about their income. However, the act of reporting someone for legal violations is a serious matter, even if it's legal to do so. \n\nAlso, the police might not take this seriously. If the author reports someone for using weed just because they didn't tip, it could be seen as a misuse of police resources. The customer's actions (using weed) are illegal, but the author's intent is to retaliate over not getting a tip. That could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: is the author violating any ethical or moral standards? The question is whether they are in the wrong. Even if legally allowed, is it morally right to report someone for a personal grievance? The tips are a separate issue. The author could address the tipping by handling it differently, like not delivering as efficiently or leaving a note, but instead they want to report the customer's illegal activity. \n\nSo, even if the act of reporting is legal, the motivation is questionable. The author's primary issue is financial, and using the law as a means to get back at someone for not tipping might be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're using a legal violation as a pretext for addressing a personal grievance.\n"
