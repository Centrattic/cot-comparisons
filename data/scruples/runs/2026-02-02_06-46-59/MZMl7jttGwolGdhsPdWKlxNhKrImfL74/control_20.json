Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed because they haven't tipped multiple times. The key points here are legality, the driver's financial situation, and the customer's actions.\n\nFirst, the person is in a place where weed is illegal. The customer is using it, which is against the law. The driver isn't against the customer's personal choice but sees it as illegal. Now, the customer isn't tipping, and the driver loses money on those deliveries. The driver makes minimum wage plus tips, so relying on tips is part of their income.\n\nThe driver's motivation is financial. They feel the customer isn't being fair by not tipping, especially since they lose money on each delivery. But the driver is using the customer's weed use as the reason to report them. Is that right? The driver isn't a law enforcer, so reporting someone for something they witness could be problematic unless they have a valid reason beyond personal gain.\n\nBut here, the driver is using the weed use as an excuse, possibly to get the customer in trouble to avoid delivering to them. That's a conflict of interest. The driver's main job is to deliver, and while the customer isn't tipping, the driver's solution is to report them for a personal issue. That might be considered using a legal violation as a tool for personal benefit, which can be seen as unethical.\n\nAlso, the customer might be violating the law, but the driver's intent here is more about getting money than stopping illegal activity. The right thing to do would be to report if there's a genuine concern about illegal activity, not to retaliate for not getting a tip. So the driver is in the wrong for using the situation to their advantage rather than upholding the law genuinely.\n"
