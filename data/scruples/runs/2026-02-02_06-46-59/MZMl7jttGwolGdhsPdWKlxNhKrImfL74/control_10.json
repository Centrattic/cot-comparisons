Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and is smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the main points here: the customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time they smell like weed. The driver lives in a place where smoking weed is illegal. The customer is one of the farthest deliveries, so the driver loses money each time. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's not a mistake.\n\nNow, the key questions are: Is the driver justified in reporting the customer? Or is the driver overstepping by using the tip issue as a reason to report the weed use?\n\nLegally, if weed is illegal where they are, the customer is breaking the law. But the driver's role is to deliver food, not enforce laws. So, does the driver have a responsibility to report? Or is this a case of the driver using the law as a way to retaliate for not getting tips?\n\nAlso, the customer's choice to not tip is separate from their legal status. Even if the customer is breaking the law by using weed, the driver's primary grievance is about not receiving a tip. The driver might be conflating these two issues.\n\nIn terms of ethics, reporting someone for not tipping is a gray area. The driver might be in the wrong because the tip issue is a business matter, and using the law to address it could be seen as an overreach. The police might not take the report seriously if the main motive is to get the customer to tip, even if there's an illegal activity involved.\n\nBut then again, if the driver has a legitimate reason to believe the customer is using an illegal substance, maybe they have a duty to report. However, the driver's primary job isn't law enforcement, so they might not be in the right to report someone for personal reasons like tips.\n\nSo, considering all this, the driver's main motive seems to be the lack of tips, using the weed as an excuse. That could make them in the wrong. But if the weed use is indeed illegal and the driver is reporting it, then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, since the driver is using their position to report someone based on a personal grievance, that's where the issue lies.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using the illegal activity as a pretext for their own financial grievances, which is not appropriate. The right action would be to address the tip issue through proper channels, not by reporting a customer for something that might not be their main concern.\n"
