Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and is seen smoking weed. The author is a pizza delivery driver who relies on tips, and this customer is one of their farthest deliveries, causing them to lose money each time. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area and the customer's deliberate non-tipping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer's actions could be a crime. However, the author's main issue is the lack of tipping. The customer isn't just forgetting; they're entering $0.00 intentionally. The author makes $5 an hour plus tips, so not getting tips affects their income.\n\nNow, the question is whether reporting the customer for smoking weed is justified. Even if it's illegal, the author's motivation is financial gain from the report. In many places, you can't report someone for a crime just to get a reward or personal benefit. That might be considered entrapment or misuse of the legal system. So, even if the customer is breaking the law, the author's intent to gain financially by reporting them could make the author complicit in some way.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they don't have a problem with weed personally. They focus on the fact that it's illegal. But their main grievance is the lack of tips. Reporting the customer for a non-related offense (smell of weed) to get a tip might be seen as using a legal action for personal gain, which is unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed committing a crime, the author might have a right to report it. But the real issue is the author's motivation. If the report is retaliatory or for personal benefit, that's where it becomes problematic. The author could be in the wrong because they're using the legal system to enforce a personal grudge rather than reporting a genuine threat or crime without ulterior motives.\n\nAnother angle: the customer's non-tipping is a civil matter between them and the delivery service. The author can't force the customer to tip, so using illegal activities as a reason to report them might be a stretch. Plus, the customer might not be the only one at fault here; maybe they have a valid reason for not tipping, but the author's perception is that it's intentional.\n\nIn conclusion, while the customer might be breaking the law by smoking weed, the author's intent to report them for personal gain (to get tips or make up for lost money) makes their action ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
