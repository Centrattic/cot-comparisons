Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who works for a pizza place. They're asking if they'd be in the wrong for reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and is clearly under the influence of weed. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's behavior, and the driver's financial situation.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that smoking weed is illegal where they live. So if the customer is using it, that's a legal violation. But the driver is considering reporting the customer for not tipping and for being stoned. The main issue here is whether the driver should involve the police over a tip issue. \n\nTips are supposed to be voluntary, right? The customer is choosing to tip $0.00 each time, which is their right. The driver is losing money on these deliveries because of distance, but that's a business consideration. The driver's main grievance is the lack of tips and the customer's use of weed. \n\nBut wait, the driver is using the weed as evidence to report the customer. However, the weed use isn't directly related to the tip amount. The customer might be stoned, but that doesn't necessarily mean they can't tip. Also, if the customer is clearly under the influence, maybe they are in a situation where they can't make sound decisions, but that's not the driver's place to judge. \n\nThe user is making $5 an hour and relying on tips. That's a low base wage, so tips are crucial for their income. However, the decision to tip is the customer's choice, not the driver's to enforce. So reporting someone for not tipping, even if they're using an illegal substance, might be seen as crossing a line. The driver's motivation seems to be financial, not safety or immediate harm. \n\nBut the user is also citing the illegal weed use as a reason. If the driver has a legitimate reason to suspect illegal activity, maybe they can report that. However, the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, which is separate. It's possible the driver is conflating the two issues. \n\nIn terms of legality, if the driver is reporting the customer for using illegal substances, that's their right. However, doing so out of financial motive rather than safety or preventing illegal activity could be seen as wrong. The police might not take the report seriously if it's primarily about tips. \n\nAlso, there's a power dynamic here. The driver is in a service role, and taking action against a customer could be seen as abusive. The customer isn't in a position to retaliate directly, but the driver's action could lead to legal consequences for the customer. \n\nSo, is the driver in the wrong? They're using a legal violation (weed use) as a pretext to address their own financial grievances. That seems opportunistic. The correct approach would be to address the tipping issue with the employer or customer directly, not through reporting for an unrelated illegal activity. Therefore, the driver is likely in the wrong here.\n"
