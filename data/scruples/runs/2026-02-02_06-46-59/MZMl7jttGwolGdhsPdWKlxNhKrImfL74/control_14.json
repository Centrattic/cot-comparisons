Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and is clearly under the influence of weed. The main points here are whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the customer isn't tipping four times, and each time is stoned and smells like weed. The author mentions that the customer intentionally writes $0.00 in the tip. The author is losing money on each delivery because it's a far delivery. They also state that they make $5 an hour and rely on tips. The key here is the legality of weed where they live.\n\nSo, the author is considering reporting the customer for using an illegal substance. But is that the right move? Well, the author's job is to deliver pizza, and their income relies on tips. The customer isn't tipping, which affects the author's earnings. However, the act of using weed is illegal, so the author might think reporting is justified. But is the author overstepping?\n\nI need to consider if the author has a valid reason to report. The author's main issue is the lack of tips, but the customer's weed use is a separate issue. The author is using the weed use as a reason to report them. But maybe the author is using this as a pretext because they're upset about the lack of tips. Also, the customer is a repeat offender, so the author might be frustrated.\n\nLegally, the author might not have a duty to report someone for personal reasons. Their job isn't to police customers. However, if they believe there's illegal activity, they can report it. But is the customer's weed use something that the author can prove? The author can smell weed, but can they prove it was marijuana? Maybe not, but they can report their suspicion.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's main grievance is about tips. Reporting the customer for weed use might be a way to get back at them for not tipping. That could make the author's intent questionable. They might be using the legal system to enforce personal gain, which is ethically iffy.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they have no problem with weed personally but are against it because it's illegal. So they're not motivated by disapproval but by the legal status. The customer's behavior is illegal, but the author might be overstepping their role as a delivery driver.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author's intent might be more about getting tips than genuine concern for the law. So, even if they report the customer, the underlying motive could make them an asshole. However, if they genuinely believe illegal activity is occurring, they might not be in the wrong. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A (yes) because their main issue is the lack of tips, using the weed as an excuse.\n"
