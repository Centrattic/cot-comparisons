Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the original post is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a delivery driver who's been giving a customer pizza on time with correct orders. The customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time, the customer is stoned and the author can smell weed. The author is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. They mention that the customer intentionally puts $0.00 as a tip, not forgetting. The author's hourly wage is $5, and they rely on tips to make money.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nLet me think about the legal aspect first. If weed is illegal where they live, then using it is against the law. The author might report the customer for that. However, is it the author's place to enforce the law? Generally, anyone can report illegal activities, but there might be nuances. For example, if the author is using their position to target the customer for not tipping, that could be a conflict of interest or misuse of authority. But the author isn't a law enforcement officer, just a delivery driver. Legally, they can report, but ethically, is it right?\n\nEthically, the author's motivation is important. They want to report because the customer isn't tipping. That's a financial motive. If the author reports the customer primarily because of the lack of tips, it could be seen as using illegal means to get money back, which isn't right. The police might not appreciate being used as a lever for personal gain. However, if the author genuinely believes the customer is violating the law and is reporting out of concern for public safety, that's different. But in this case, the author's posts suggest the main issue is the lack of tips rather than public harm.\n\nAlso, the customer is choosing to tip zero, which is within their rights. The author can't force the customer to tip. However, the customer's actions (using illegal drugs) are separate from the tipping. If the author reports the customer purely out of spite over not receiving tips, that's a different matter.\n\nAnother angle: the author's job is to deliver pizza. If they report customers for personal reasons, it could affect their job. The employer might not want their drivers getting involved in personal vendettas, especially with customers. So there's a professional conduct aspect here too.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is indeed using illegal substances, the author has a right to report that. But the author's primary grievance is the lack of tips, which complicates the situation. The ethical dilemma here is whether the author is misusing the police to address a financial issue that the legal system isn't designed to handle.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author might be allowed to report since it's a crime, but ethically, the main motivation is financial gain from the customer's actions. That could be considered wrong because it's using the law as a tool for personal benefit rather than public good. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer primarily because they didn't tip.\n"
