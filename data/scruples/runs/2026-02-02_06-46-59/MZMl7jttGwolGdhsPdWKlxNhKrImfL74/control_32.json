Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is clearly smoking weed.\n\nFirst, the main points: the customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the driver noticed the customer was high on weed and smelled like it. The driver loses money on these deliveries because it's a far location. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's not a mistake. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nThe driver's argument is that using weed is illegal in their area, so they want to report the customer. But the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nHmm. Well, the driver is a delivery person, and tips are a big part of their income. The customer isn't tipping, which is affecting the driver's earnings. But the driver wants to report the customer for a different reason\u2014illegal drug use. So the driver is considering using the customer's drug use as a reason to report them, but the real issue is the lack of tips.\n\nBut wait, the driver might be conflating two separate issues. The customer not tipping is one thing, and the customer using weed is another. Even if the customer is using an illegal substance, the driver's job is to deliver the pizza, not to enforce drug laws. Reporting someone for drug use is a serious action and should be based on actual evidence of illegal activity, not just the smell of weed, which could be subjective. Also, the driver's motivation here seems to be financial\u2014since the customer doesn't tip and the delivery is costly. So the driver might be using the weed as an excuse to report someone they're upset about not tipping.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the driver's intent to report might be a way to retaliate for not receiving tips. That could be seen as using the law for personal gain rather than genuine concern for illegal activity. Unless the driver has a legitimate reason to report the drug use (like seeing someone smoking in a public place where it's prohibited, or selling it), just smelling weed and not tipping might not be enough. The driver could be overstepping by using the law to get back at the customer for not tipping. That would make the driver in the wrong because they're using the legal system for a personal grievance rather than a real legal issue.\n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're considering reporting the customer for a personal reason (lack of tips) under the pretense of illegal drug use, which might not be a valid or justifiable reason. They should address the tip issue directly with their employer or the customer, not report the customer to the police for something that's not their responsibility to enforce.\n"
