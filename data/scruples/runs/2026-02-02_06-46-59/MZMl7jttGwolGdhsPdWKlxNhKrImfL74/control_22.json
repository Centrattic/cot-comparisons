Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're wrong to report a customer for smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped them four times, and each time the driver noticed the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting, and that the delivery is far, causing them to lose money. They work for $5/hour and rely on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of the situation. The user says weed is illegal where they live, so if the customer is using it, that's a crime. But the customer is in their own home, right? Unless the driver saw them using it in public, which isn't stated here. The driver just smells weed when delivering, which might be in the customer's home. Reporting someone for using an illegal substance in their own home is a gray area. Law enforcement usually doesn't get involved unless there's a public nuisance or other issues. \n\nThen there's the issue of the tip. The customer explicitly writes $0.00, so it's not a mistake. The driver is upset because they rely on tips, especially since this delivery is costly. But is it right to report someone for not tipping? The driver is a service worker, but the customer isn't legally obligated to tip. The driver's main grievance is the lack of tips, but they're using the weed as a reason to report the customer. That seems like a conflict of interest where the driver is using a legal issue to address a personal financial grievance. \n\nAlso, the driver's role as a delivery person\u2014do they have a duty to report illegal activities? Maybe if they suspect a crime, but in this case, it's a private residence. The driver isn't in a position to enforce the law. Reporting for not tipping is not a legal issue. The driver might be mixing personal frustration with something that's technically illegal but not directly affecting them. \n\nSo the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for using the weed as an excuse to report the customer over a tip issue. Reporting someone for a legal infraction (if using weed is illegal) might be permissible, but if the main motive is revenge for not tipping, it's not justified. The driver could be in the wrong because they're using a legal matter to address a personal financial issue, which might be considered unethical or a misuse of the reporting system. \n\nAdditionally, if the customer is using weed in their home, even if it's illegal, it's a civil offense, not a criminal one, unless there's a specific complaint. The police might not act on it. The driver's action might be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a legitimate report. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their primary motive is the lack of tips, and they're using the weed issue to retaliate.\n"
