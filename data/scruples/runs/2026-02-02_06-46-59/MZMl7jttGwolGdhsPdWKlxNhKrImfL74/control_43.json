Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's been repeatedly not tipped by a customer. The customer is often stoned and smells of weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver is considering reporting the customer for drug use because they lose money on each delivery and the customer intentionally tips $0.00.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether reporting the customer for smoking weed is justified. The user's motivation is financial\u2014since the customer doesn't tip and the delivery is costly. But legally, just because someone is smoking weed in their own home doesn't necessarily make it the neighbor's responsibility to report them. Unless there's a clear violation of public consumption laws, the user might not have a solid legal basis to report them solely for drug use. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The user relies on tips for income, and the customer's choice to use weed isn't directly affecting the service quality. The order is correct and on time. The user's frustration is understandable, but using the situation to report the customer for a personal activity (even if illegal) seems like a stretch. It could be seen as using the law to gain a personal advantage, which might not be ethical. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that the customer writes $0.00 intentionally, not forgetting. That's a separate issue. Reporting them for not tipping isn't a legal matter, so the user's real issue is financial, but using a drug charge to address that feels like an overreach. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the user is likely in the wrong for wanting to report the customer not for actual harm but personal gain. The answer should be A.\n"
