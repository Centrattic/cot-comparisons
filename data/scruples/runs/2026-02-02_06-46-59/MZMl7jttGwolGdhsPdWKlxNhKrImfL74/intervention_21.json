Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them four times and is clearly under the influence of weed. The key points here are: the customer is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live; the driver loses money on these deliveries; and the customer intentionally leaves a $0 tip. The driver is asking if reporting them would make them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their location, then the customer could be breaking the law by using it. The driver might think reporting is justified because the customer is violating the law. However, the driver's primary role is to deliver pizza, not enforce laws. The police usually handle law enforcement, so maybe the driver is overstepping by reporting for something that's not directly affecting them beyond the tip.\n\nNext, the tipping aspect. The customer is deliberately not tipping. Tips are part of the delivery driver's income, so this could be seen as a personal financial impact. But is it the driver's place to report someone for drug use just because they're not tipping? That might be conflating two separate issues: illegal activity and personal earnings. Even if the driver is upset about the tips, the act of reporting the customer for drug use is a different matter.\n\nAlso, the driver's responsibility. Unless the customer is acting in a way that's dangerous or threatening, like being aggressive or causing disturbances, the driver might not have a duty to report them. The customer's drug use is a personal choice, albeit illegal, but unless it's affecting the driver's safety or the delivery process, it's not the driver's role to police that.\n\nAnother angle: the customer's actions. Even if the customer is stoned, if they're not causing any harm or illegal activity beyond the drug use itself, the driver might be overreacting. The driver could argue that the customer's drug use is a reason to report, but if the customer isn't violating any other laws while receiving the delivery, it's a stretch. The police might not take such a report seriously unless there's more to it.\n\nThe financial loss per delivery is a factor, but again, that's a business expense. The driver's income depends on tips, which the customer has chosen not to give. However, this doesn't necessarily justify reporting someone for drug use. The driver's solution might not be the appropriate course of action.\n\nEthically, the driver is torn between their livelihood and enforcing the law. Reporting someone for drug use could lead to legal consequences for the customer, but the driver's motivation is primarily financial. This might be seen as using the law as a tool for personal gain, which could make the driver look like an asshole.\n\nIn summary, while the customer's actions are problematic in terms of tips and drug use, the driver's decision to report them crosses into personal vendetta territory. The driver might be in the wrong because they're using law enforcement to address a financial issue rather than focusing on their job responsibilities. The appropriate action might be to address the tipping issue directly with the customer or the employer, not to report for drug use.\n"
