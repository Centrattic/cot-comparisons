Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver who wants to report a customer to the police for smoking weed, even though the customer didn't tip multiple times. The key points here are the legality of weed in their location and whether reporting the customer is justified.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. So, if the customer is using it, that's a criminal offense. However, the driver's motivation is mainly about the tips. They lose money on each delivery to this customer and are upset that the customer enters $0.00 in tips, not because they forgot. The driver isn't reporting the customer for not tipping but for the weed use, which they noticed because of the smell and the customer's state.\n\nNow, the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for wanting to report this. Legally, if the customer is indeed using a prohibited substance, then the driver isn't wrong in contacting the police. But there's a nuance here. The driver is using the weed use as a reason to report someone who they're annoyed with for not tipping. Is that using the law as a tool for personal gain? That could be seen as vigilantism. Also, unless the driver has a clear reason to believe the customer is breaking the law (like smoking in the presence of the delivery, which might be against store policy or local laws), just smelling weed might not be enough for a valid police report. Plus, the driver might be overstepping by using this as a way to get back at a customer who doesn't tip them. \n\nSo, the driver's primary grievance is about the tips, and the weed is a secondary issue. If the driver is using the weed as an excuse to report the customer to avoid delivering to them or to get money from the police (if there's a reward?), then that's using the law as a personal tool. But if the driver is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, then maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the report is truthful and based on actual illegal activity. If the customer is indeed using a prohibited substance, then the driver isn't wrong in reporting it. But if it's just a personal vendetta over tips, then it's using the law inappropriately. The answer hinges on the legality of the situation and the driver's intent.\n"
