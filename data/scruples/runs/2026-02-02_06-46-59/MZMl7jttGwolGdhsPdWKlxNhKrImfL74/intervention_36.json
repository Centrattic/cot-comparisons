Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times. The customer is under the influence and smells like weed each time, and the user feels they lose money on these deliveries due to the distance. They make $5 an hour and depend on tips, so not getting tipped is a hit to their income.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong for wanting to report the customer. The key points here are: the legality of weed in the area, the customer's behavior, and the motivation behind the report.\n\nThe user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is smoking weed in their own home, that's their choice, but the driver is witnessing this through the smell and possible observation. However, the driver's access to the customer's home is limited to delivering pizza. Unless the customer is using weed in the driver's presence in a public place where it's prohibited, the driver might not have a legal basis to report them. \n\nThe main issue seems to be the lack of tipping. The driver is upset because the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting due to being high. The driver is considering reporting the customer not just because of the weed use, but specifically because of the lack of tips, which is a financial issue. Using the illegality of weed as a pretext for reporting the customer might be a stretch if the real motive is the tipping. \n\nEthically, the driver has a right to expect proper treatment, including tipping, but the act of reporting someone to the police for a civil matter (like not tipping) when the primary crime is something else (weed use) could be seen as misuse of authority or an invasion of privacy. The driver isn't in a position to enforce laws; that's the police's job. Additionally, the customer's weed use, if it's in their private home and not affecting the driver's job performance (like being rude, delaying the delivery, etc.), might not be a valid reason for the report. \n\nSo, the driver's intention to report the customer primarily because of not tipping, using the weed smell as a justification, could be considered wrong. The focus should be on the customer's right to privacy and the driver's proper role. The driver might have a right to be upset about the tips, but reporting to police for that reason isn't appropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
