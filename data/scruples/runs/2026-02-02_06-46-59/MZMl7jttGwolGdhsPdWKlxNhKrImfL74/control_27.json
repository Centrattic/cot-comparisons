Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for reporting someone who doesn't tip them multiple times and smells like weed. The key points here are about legality, personal ethics, and the situation's context.\n\nFirst, the customer isn't tipping, and the driver feels they lose money on those far deliveries. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. The driver isn't against weed in general but is considering reporting because it's against the law.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer. Legally, if weed is illegal, then the customer's actions are illegal. However, the driver's primary grievance is about not getting tipped. The driver might be using the weed as a reason to report the customer primarily because of the financial loss from the tips and the long delivery distance.\n\nI need to consider if the driver's motivation is appropriate. If the main reason is to get the customer to tip more, that could be seen as using the law for personal gain, which is inappropriate. But if the driver genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law (smoking weed), then reporting it would be their civic duty, even if they have a secondary motive.\n\nBut wait, the driver isn't sure if the customer is breaking the law. They just assume that because there's a smell of weed, it's illegal. However, maybe the customer is in a state where weed is legal. Wait, the user says \"illegal where I live,\" so the location matters. So the customer is violating the local laws by smoking weed. Therefore, the driver could be correct in their assessment of the illegality.\n\nBut is it the driver's place to report someone for a personal reason? Even if the act is illegal, the driver might be acting out of self-interest rather than public safety. The police might question the driver's motives if they're primarily concerned about tips rather than drug use. However, the law doesn't require pure motives for reporting crimes. So technically, the driver isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime they witness, even if they have a personal motive.\n\nBut the user is asking if they are a bad person (WIBTA), which is more about social judgment than legal. In some cases, people might view this as using the law as a weapon for personal gain, which could be seen as unethical. However, others might argue that if it's illegal, they have a duty to report it, regardless of personal feelings. The answer could depend on societal norms and the balance between personal ethics and legal obligations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A for Yes (author is in the wrong) because the primary motivation is financial gain rather than public safety, which could be seen as unethical. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the act is illegal and reporting is appropriate regardless of motive. But I need to check the specifics again.\n\nThe user is a delivery driver, the customer is violating the law by smoking weed where it's illegal. The driver reports them. Legally, it's allowed. Socially, some might think it's using the law for personal gain, but others might support it. The answer hinges on whether the user's action is considered unethical despite being legal. Since the question is about being an asshole, the answer might be A if the act is seen as exploiting the law for personal benefit, hence in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Another angle: if the driver is just a witness and reports a crime, it's their civic duty, so not in the wrong. But the context is that the driver is upset about the lack of tips. This could be seen as hypocritical or using the law inappropriately. Maybe the answer is A.\n"
