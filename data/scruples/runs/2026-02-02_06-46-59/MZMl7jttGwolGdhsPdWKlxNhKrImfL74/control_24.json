Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's asking if they're being an asshole by reporting a customer to the police for smoking weed. The main points are that the customer hasn't tipped them four times, smells like weed, and the driver loses money on each delivery. The customer explicitly sets the tip to $0.00 each time.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: If weed is illegal in their state, then the customer might be violating the law. The driver could argue that reporting is justified. But wait, just because someone smells like weed doesn't necessarily mean they're actively smoking it. Maybe they have it stored in their house and it lingers. The driver is reporting based on smell, which might not be enough for police.\n\nThen there's the motive. The driver is upset about not getting tips and losing money. They mention making $5 an hour and relying on tips. So there's a financial incentive here. If the customer is setting the tip to zero, maybe they're intentionally not tipping. But is that a reason to report them? The driver might be using the weed as a pretext for the real issue, which is money.\n\nEthically, is it right to report someone for not tipping? The driver's primary job is to deliver pizza, and the customer isn't violating any delivery policies regarding tips. Tips are voluntary, though customers often choose to leave them. But the driver is taking it further by citing another issue\u2014smoking weed. If the customer is indeed violating the law, then the driver might be within their rights to report. However, if the driver's main issue is the lack of tips and the financial loss, the report could be seen as a way to retaliate rather than a genuine concern for the law.\n\nAlso, the police might not take the report seriously unless there's clear evidence. The smell of weed isn't proof of active use. The driver could be wasting police resources. That might make the driver the asshole, as they're using their own grievance to involve law enforcement in a minor issue.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the driver is using the weed as a reason to report someone for a financial grievance, that's probably the wrong move. The driver should address the tipping issue through their employer, maybe by discussing delivery pay or customer behavior, rather than involving the police. So, the driver could be in the wrong for letting personal financial stress lead to a potentially unfounded report.\n"
