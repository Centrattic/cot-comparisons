Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're being an asshole by considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The key points here are the legal status of weed where they live, the customer's consistent no-tipping, and the financial impact on the driver.\n\nFirst, the legality of weed is important. If it's illegal in their area, then the customer could be breaking the law. The driver might think that reporting them would be justified because they're doing something illegal. But is the driver allowed to report someone just for that? It depends on the laws. In some places, you can report crimes, but others might have privacy concerns or require a direct threat.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer intentionally writes $0.00, not forgetting. The driver relies on tips, especially for long deliveries where they lose money each time. This could be a financial hardship. But is it ethical to report someone for not tipping? Tipping is a social norm, not a legal requirement, unless there's some specific law enforcing it. So unless the customer is violating a law by not tipping, which is rare, reporting them for that might not hold up.\n\nThe driver's motivation here is a mix of personal financial need and the customer's illegal activity. Even if the customer is smoking weed illegally, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer. Reporting someone for something they observe could be seen as a citizen's arrest or a report, which is allowed in some cases. But there's a risk of false accusations if there's no clear evidence. The driver might have smelled weed, but proving someone is smoking it might require more than just a smell.\n\nAlso, the ethical angle: is it right to report someone for not tipping? The driver is upset about lost income, but the customer has a right to choose not to tip. Unless there's a policy in place that requires tipping, the driver can't force it. So the driver's anger is understandable, but using the illegal weed as a reason to report might be conflating two separate issues.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the question is whether the action is justified. If the driver reports the customer for smoking weed, they might be trying to get back at them for not tipping. That's using a legal issue as a means of revenge, which is unethical. On the other hand, if the driver genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law and is reporting them for that, it's a different scenario. But the risk is that the customer might not be breaking any laws (if weed is legal in their area), or the driver might not have enough evidence.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether reporting was done for the right reasons and with valid evidence. If the driver is using the weed as a way to retaliate for not tipping, then they're in the wrong. If they're genuinely trying to report a legal violation without ulterior motives, it's a gray area. But since the question is about being an asshole, it's more about the intent and the ethical stance. The driver's primary grievance is the lack of tips, so using a legal report as a way to get back would make them the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because their motivation is personal gain rather than upholding the law without bias.\n"
