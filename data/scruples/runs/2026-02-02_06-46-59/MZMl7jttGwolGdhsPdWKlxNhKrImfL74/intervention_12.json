Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. The author is a delivery driver who relies on tips, and the customer hasn't tipped four times, each time smelling of weed. The author is considering reporting because weed is illegal where they live.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is indeed illegal in their area, then the customer is committing a crime by using it. But the author's role is to deliver pizza, not to police the customers. The main issue here is the customer not tipping, which is a separate matter from illegal activity. \n\nThe author is upset about the lack of tips because it affects their income, especially since the delivery is far and costs them money. But reporting someone to the police for not tipping seems like a stretch. Even if they believe the customer is using an illegal substance, the author isn't in a position to enforce the law. It's possible that the police might not take action unless there's a clear violation observed. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's intentional. The customer might not want to tip, which is their choice, though it's not ethical. But using that as a reason to report them for drug use could be seen as a vendetta. \n\nThe key points are: Is the author justified in reporting for a crime (drug use) based on smell? What if the customer is using legally (if state law changed)? The author might be overstepping by using a personal grievance (lack of tips) as a motive to report. Even if the drug use is illegal, the author's primary intent seems to be about the tips, which complicates the situation. \n\nIn many cases, citizens can report suspected crimes, but using a personal conflict as a reason could be problematic. The police might not act on such a report if there's no evidence beyond the smell and the author's claim. Plus, the author could face backlash if the report is seen as retaliatory. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They have valid concerns about their income, but the method they're considering (reporting for drug use) might be the wrong approach. The right action would be to address the tipping issue through the employer or customer service, not by involving law enforcement over a non-criminal matter (tipping) and possibly a criminal one they can't prove.\n"
