Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author would be in the wrong for reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times despite smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. The author is a delivery driver making $5 an hour and relying on tips. The customer is far away, costing them money each time, and writes $0.00 in tips, not forgetting. The author's main points are about the legal aspect of weed and their own financial situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. So, technically, the author might have a legal right to report them. But is it ethical to report someone for not tipping? That's a different angle. The author is upset about the lack of tips, which affects their income. However, using the fact that the customer is smoking weed as a reason to report them could be seen as exploiting a legal issue for personal gain. \n\nOn one hand, the author is within their rights to report a crime. On the other hand, their primary motivation is financial gain rather than public safety. This could be seen as a misuse of the reporting system. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether their intentions are justified. If their main reason is to get the customer to tip, then it's using the law for personal benefit, which is unethical. But if they genuinely believe the customer is breaking the law, they have a duty to report. However, since the author acknowledges they don't have a problem with weed itself but are more upset about the lack of tips, their intent might be seen as self-serving. \n\nAlso, the customer's behavior (writing $0.00) is a separate issue from drug use. The author could address the tipping issue directly without involving the police. So, reporting for non-payment of tips (which isn't illegal) under the guise of drug use could be considered wrong. The author might be conflating two issues. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't legally wrong for reporting a potential crime, ethically they could be in the wrong for using the drug issue to get a better tip. The answer is likely B (they are not in the wrong legally), but the question is about being in the wrong in general. The community might view them as an asshole for exploiting the situation. So, the answer here might be A (they are in the wrong) because their motivation is self-serving and using illegal activity as a reason to report for personal gain is unethical.\n"
