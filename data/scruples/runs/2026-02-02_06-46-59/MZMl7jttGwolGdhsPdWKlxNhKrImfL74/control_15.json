Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is a delivery driver who's frustrated because a customer hasn't tipped them four times, and each time the customer was clearly under the influence of weed. The user wants to know if they're in the wrong if they report the customer to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned that weed is illegal in their area. If the customer is smoking weed, that is technically a crime. However, just being high and having the smell doesn't necessarily mean they're breaking the law unless the user witnesses the act. Also, police might not take a report based on a delivery driver's suspicion. So there's a question about whether the user has enough evidence to justify a report.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The user relies on tips for their income, and this customer is costing them money with a far delivery and zero tips. They're not just neglecting to tip but actively entering $0.00. The user isn't just angry about the money; they feel wronged. But is it right to report someone for something that's a personal choice, even if illegal? The user is using the customer's weed use as a reason to report them, which might be a way to take revenge for the lack of tips. That could be seen as unethical because the main motive isn't to enforce the law but to get back at someone for not tipping.\n\nAlso, the user's job is to deliver pizza, not to enforce laws. Their responsibility is to provide service, not to police customers. So even if they think they're right, stepping into a law enforcement role could be problematic. Plus, if the customer isn't doing anything illegal at the moment of delivery, like actively smoking, just being high, it's hard to make a case.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is in a situation where they need the tips to make a living. The customer's actions (not tipping) are costing them money. But using the customer's personal behavior as an excuse to report them might be a stretch. The user might be conflating two separate issues: the lack of tips and the customer's personal drug use.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user's primary motivation seems to be revenge over the tips, not genuine concern about illegal activity. Reporting someone for a personal grudge, even if there's a legal aspect, could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong.\n"
