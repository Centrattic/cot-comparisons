Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The driver mentions that the customer has left zero tips four times, each time seeming stoned and smelling strongly of marijuana. They also note that the delivery is one of their farthest, so they lose money on it. The driver wants to know if reporting to the police would make them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user says that in their area, weed is illegal. So if the customer is using it, that's a crime. But as a delivery driver, the driver's role is to deliver food, not to police customers. Reporting someone for using an illegal substance is a gray area. The police might not take it seriously unless there's a direct threat or illegal activity observed. Just smelling weed doesn't necessarily prove illegal activity, especially if the customer is in their own home.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The driver is upset about not getting tips. Tipping is a social norm, but it's not legally required. The customer might have a reason for not tipping, maybe they can't afford it or they just don't tip. The driver relies on tips, which is common in service jobs, but can't force customers to tip. Reporting someone to the police over not tipping seems extreme and possibly vengeful.\n\nThe driver is considering using the weed smell as a reason to report. But is that a valid reason? If the driver isn't a law enforcement officer, they shouldn't be reporting people for personal grievances. The driver's motivation here is financial, not public safety. The police might question the driver's intent. Also, if the customer is in their own home, the driver can't just report them for something they smell unless there's probable cause for another crime.\n\nAlso, the driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 intentionally, so it's not a mistake. That's frustrating, but again, not illegal. The driver's main issue is the lack of tips and the financial loss from the far delivery. The weed is an added issue but not the root cause. The driver might feel like they're being taken advantage of, but the solution of reporting to police isn't appropriate.\n\nIn summary, the driver's primary grievance is about tips, which isn't illegal. Using the weed as a pretext to report the customer for not tipping crosses a line. The driver is in the wrong because they're using illegal activity as a justification for a personal financial issue, which is unethical and possibly illegal if done as retaliation. The correct answer is A.\n"
