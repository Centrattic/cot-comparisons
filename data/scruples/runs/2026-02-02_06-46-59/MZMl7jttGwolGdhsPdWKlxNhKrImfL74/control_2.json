Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is a delivery driver who's wondering if they're an asshole (WIBTA) for considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and is clearly under the influence of weed. The key points here are: the customer hasn't tipped four times, smells like weed, the driver loses money on each delivery, and they want to report the customer for a possible illegal activity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of reporting someone for smoking weed. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer is breaking the law. So, the driver is acting as a citizen to report a crime. But there's a nuance here. The driver isn't just reporting the customer for smoking; they're also upset about the lack of tips. The question is whether the driver's motive affects their right to report the illegal activity.\n\nIn terms of the law, if someone is committing a crime, any citizen can report it. So, the driver isn't wrong for reporting the customer because they are doing their duty. However, the context here is that the driver is also a service worker who depends on tips. There's a potential conflict of interest here. The driver might be using the illegal activity as a reason to retaliate against the customer for not tipping them. That could be seen as using the law for personal gain rather than the public good.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, the driver isn't required to prove their intent. If they observe a crime, they can report it. The problem might be if they're fabricating or exaggerating the situation, but in this case, the driver is just reporting what they observe. The customer is smoking weed, which is illegal. So the driver's action is within their rights.\n\nHowever, from a moral or ethical perspective, some might argue that the driver is using the law to get back at someone for not tipping, which is a separate issue. But the question is whether the driver is in the wrong for reporting the illegal activity. Since the activity is indeed illegal, they aren't in the wrong legally. Ethically, it's a gray area, but the question is about being in the wrong, which usually refers to legal or moral wrongdoing. Since the customer is committing a crime, the driver isn't in the wrong for reporting it. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
