Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is smoking weed. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the customer isn't tipping four times, and each time they smell like weed. The driver mentions they lose money on these deliveries because it's a far location. They make $5 an hour and rely on tips. The customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's intentional, not a mistake.\n\nNow, the driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed. The question is whether the driver is in the wrong by doing so. \n\nIn the US, marijuana is illegal under federal law, but some states have legalized it for recreational or medical use. If the state where this is happening has legal marijuana, then the customer isn't breaking the law. However, if the state still prohibits it, then it's illegal. The driver is in a place where it's illegal, according to their statement.\n\nBut even if it's illegal, the driver isn't a law enforcement officer. Reporting someone for smoking weed could be seen as a private citizen reporting a crime. However, there's a nuance here. If the driver's main motivation is to get the tip, maybe they're using the law as a tool for personal gain, which might be considered unethical. \n\nAlso, the customer is not causing harm beyond their own use. The driver is upset about the lost tips and money on deliveries. The customer's actions (not tipping and smoking) are separate issues. The customer not tipping is a civil issue, while smoking weed is a criminal one. \n\nBut if the driver reports the customer, they might be overstepping if their intent is to force the customer to tip, which isn't part of the law enforcement's role. The driver could be acting out of spite or financial motivation, which could make their actions questionable ethically, even if legally permissible in some jurisdictions. \n\nHowever, if the driver genuinely believes someone is breaking the law and is reporting them in good faith, that might be okay. But since the main issue here is the tip, maybe the driver's primary intent is not to enforce the law but to get money, which complicates things. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of whether the driver can prove the customer is smoking weed. If they can't provide evidence beyond their own observation, the report might not be credible. \n\nIn some places, you can report suspected crimes, but if it's a false report, there could be legal repercussions for the person making the report. If the customer is actually not breaking the law, the driver could be in trouble for making a false report, which would make them in the wrong.\n\nSo, the driver might be in the wrong if the marijuana use is legal in their area. But if it's illegal, reporting is technically allowed. However, the intent behind the report could make the driver's actions ethically wrong. Also, if the report is a false accusation, that's definitely wrong. The key points are the legality of marijuana in the area and the driver's intent (enforcing the law vs. getting a tip). \n\nGiven that the driver states it's illegal where they live, but if the state has since legalized it, that's a problem. However, the user says it's illegal, so we might assume that. But even then, using the law as leverage for personal gain is ethically questionable. So the answer might be that the driver is in the wrong because their intent is not purely to enforce the law but to get a tip.\n"
