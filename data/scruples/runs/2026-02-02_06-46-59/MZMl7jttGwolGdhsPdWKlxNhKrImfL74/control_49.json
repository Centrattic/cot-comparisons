Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver (the author) is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. \n\nFirst, the key points: The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time appears stoned, and the driver loses money on these deliveries. The driver makes $5/hour and relies on tips. The customer explicitly enters $0.00 in the tip section. The driver is in a place where weed is illegal.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the driver is justified in reporting the customer for illegal activity. The customer's weed use is illegal, but the driver's job is to deliver food. The question is about the ethics of reporting someone for a personal choice that's against the law. \n\nThe driver's motivation is financial\u2014they're losing money and relying on tips. But the customer's actions (not tipping and using weed) are separate. The driver might think that by reporting, they're enforcing the law, but is that their responsibility? Also, the customer isn't harming others, just themselves. \n\nThere's a potential conflict here. The driver might be using the situation to get back at the customer for not tipping. But legally, the driver is allowed to report suspected illegal activity. However, ethically, is it right to report someone for something that's their personal choice, even if it's illegal, just because of a financial grievance?\n\nIn some places, citizens can report crimes, but there's also the concept of \"snitching\" which can be frowned upon. The driver might be overstepping by using the law to punish the customer for not tipping. The customer's weed use is a separate issue from the tip. \n\nAlso, the customer is clearly choosing not to tip by entering $0.00, so it's not an accident. The driver's job is to deliver, not to enforce the law. The driver's main responsibility is to their employer and job, not to police customers. \n\nSo, while the customer is breaking the law by using weed, the driver's intent might be more about personal gain (getting the tip) rather than genuine concern for the law. That could make the driver the asshole for using the law as a tool for revenge. \n\nBut legally, the driver isn't in the wrong for reporting a possible crime. However, ethically, the situation is more nuanced. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just legally. The title \"Would I Be The Asshole\" suggests a social morality question. \n\nIn most social contexts, people might view the driver as overreacting because the customer's weed use isn't affecting others. The driver's livelihood is based on tips, but customers can choose not to tip. The driver's job is to deliver, not to police. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if we're strictly talking about legal responsibility. But if it's about social ethics, maybe A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because using the law to retaliate for not getting tips is seen as snitching and petty. \n\nBut the user's scenario doesn't specify the legal system. In some places, citizen arrests or reporting are allowed, but using it for personal grievances could be problematic. The key is the intent. The driver's main grievance is not the weed but the lack of tips. Reporting the customer for weed use is a way to get back at them, which may not be the right approach. \n\nTherefore, ethically, the author might be in the wrong for using the law to settle a personal financial dispute. So the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
