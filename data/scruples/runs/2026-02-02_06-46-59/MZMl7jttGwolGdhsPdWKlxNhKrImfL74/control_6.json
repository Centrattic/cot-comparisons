Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer to the police over not tipping. The scenario is that the delivery driver works at a pizza place and a regular customer hasn't tipped them four times. The customer is known to be smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver mentions that the customer's order is always correct and on time, but the customer deliberately writes $0.00 in the tip. The driver loses money on each delivery because it's a far location, and they rely on tips since they only make $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if reporting the customer for smoking weed is justified here. The key points are the legality of weed in their jurisdiction, the customer's actions (not tipping), and the driver's motivation. \n\nThe main issue is whether the driver has a valid reason to report the customer. The customer's weed use is a separate issue from tipping. Even if the customer is smoking an illegal substance, the driver's role is to deliver the pizza, not to enforce the law. Unless the driver has direct evidence of the customer using or possessing weed during the delivery (like seeing them smoke it at the time of delivery), reporting them might be a misunderstanding of their responsibilities. \n\nAlso, the customer is not tipping, but that's a separate matter. The driver can't legally compel the customer to tip. Tipping is a customary practice, not a legal obligation. So, using the customer's weed use as leverage to get a tip is crossing a line. The driver's motivation here is financial, not based on actual wrongdoing by the customer. Even if the customer is breaking the law by smoking weed, the driver doesn't have the authority to report them without concrete evidence of a crime occurring at the time of the delivery. \n\nAdditionally, the driver's claim that the customer \"smells like straight weed\" each time might be a stretch. The smell of weed could linger, but unless the customer is actively using it when the driver arrives, there's no legal basis for a report. The customer could have used it earlier, and the smell alone isn't sufficient for a police report. \n\nThe driver's situation is tough\u2014making minimum wage and relying on tips. But using a personal grievance about tips to report a customer for a crime they might not be committing is not appropriate. The driver should address the tipping issue through their employer, maybe discussing expectations or company policies, but not by involving law enforcement over a non-tangential issue like weed use. \n\nSo, the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're using the customer's potential illegal activity as a means to get a tip, which is an inappropriate use of authority and could be seen as harassment or misuse of the legal system for personal gain.\n"
