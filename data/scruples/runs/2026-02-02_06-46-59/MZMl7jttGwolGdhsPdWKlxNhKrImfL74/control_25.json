Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be wrong to report a customer for smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems stoned, with a weed smell each time. The user mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not that they forget. Also, the delivery is far, so the user loses money each time, and they rely on tips since they're paid $5 an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user is in the wrong. The situation is about reporting a customer for a possible illegal activity. The key points here are the user's intent, the legality of the situation, and whether the action is justified.\n\nThe user's primary motivation is the lack of tips and financial loss from delivering to a far location. They acknowledge that the customer intentionally leaves zero tips, not just forgetting. They also rely on tips for income, which is common in service jobs. However, the main question is about reporting the customer for smoking weed. \n\nNow, in the US, for example, smoking weed is illegal federally, but some states have legalized it for recreational or medical use. The user says it's illegal where they live, so the customer's actions might be a violation of the law. But as a private citizen, can the user report someone for smoking weed? Typically, citizens can report suspected illegal activities, but it's up to law enforcement to investigate and enforce. However, this might be more of a civil issue if it's a state where personal use is legal. Wait, the user says it's illegal there, so maybe it's a state where it's not fully legal, or the customer is in a public place where it's still prohibited.\n\nBut the user's main grievance is the lack of tips. They're considering reporting the customer not just because of the weed, but because of the financial impact from not tipping. Is it appropriate to use the police to address a service job tip issue? That's a red flag. Even if the customer is breaking the law, using that as a reason to report them for non-payment of tips might be seen as using the law as a tool for personal gain, which could be problematic. Also, the user says they don't have a problem with weed personally, so it's not about moral judgment, but about the financial aspect and possible illegal activity.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the user is in a place where weed is illegal, and they have a reasonable belief the customer is using it in their presence, maybe during a delivery, perhaps if the customer is smoking during the pickup/drop-off, they might have a valid reason to report. But if it's just the smell during the delivery, it could be challenging for the police to act on without proof of illegal activity. Plus, the timing of the report's motivation is key. If the user's primary intent is to get a tip, that's not a legal justification for a report. \n\nSo, the user's intent is to address the lack of tips by reporting for a possible legal violation. Even if the customer is indeed violating the law, the user's motivation is self-serving, which might not be the right reason to involve the police. The user could be seen as exploiting the legal system to force payment, which is unethical. But if the user genuinely believes the customer is committing a crime (like public use where it's illegal), even if it's partially motivated by the tip issue, they might have a duty to report it. However, this is a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the user is a delivery driver, and their responsibility is to deliver the order. Unless the customer is using weed in a way that poses a threat (like under the influence and causing danger), it's their private business. The user might be overstepping by reporting for something they perceive as illegal but isn't necessarily their place to enforce. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is in a situation where their professional conduct is in question. Reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is a personal choice and possibly a legal issue depending on the state, but their main reason is financial gain from tips. Even if the customer is violating the law, using that as leverage for a tip might be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the user is in the wrong. But I need to make sure. \n\nWait, the user says they have no problem with weed personally, so it's not about disapproval. But they're reporting because the customer is stoned and not tipping. If the customer is clearly violating the law (and it's a criminal offense), then the user might not be in the wrong for reporting. However, if the customer is in a state where personal use is legal, then the user is wrong to report. But the user states it's illegal there. So, maybe the user is correct in their assessment of the illegality. \n\nBut even if the customer is breaking the law, the user's main motive is to get a tip. That's not a valid reason to report someone. The user should address the tip issue through their employer or customer service, not by involving the police for a legal matter. Reporting the customer for a legal violation just because they don't tip is using the law as a tool for personal gain, which is unethical. Therefore, the user is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
