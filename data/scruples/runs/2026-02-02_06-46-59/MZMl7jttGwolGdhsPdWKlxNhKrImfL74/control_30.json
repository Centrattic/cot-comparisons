Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is a delivery driver for a pizza place. They mention that a customer hasn't tipped them four times, and each time the customer was smoking weed and smelled like it. The author isn't against weed personally, but it's illegal where they live. They also note that the customer is one of their farthest deliveries, meaning they lose money on each delivery. The author is considering reporting the customer to the police and is asking if they'd be an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal and ethical aspects here. The user is in a place where weed is illegal, so if the customer is using it, that's a potential crime. However, the author's main motivation here is the lack of tips and financial loss. They mention the customer intentionally puts $0.00 in the tip, not forgetting. The author's income relies heavily on tips, which is common in service jobs, especially in delivery roles. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is justified in reporting the customer for a non-tip-related reason. Legally, if the customer is using an illegal substance, the author might have a case to report that. However, the primary motive here seems to be about the tips and money loss. Ethically, using someone's illegal activity as leverage for personal gain could be problematic. \n\nIn many places, you can report crimes you witness, but there's a difference between genuine concern for law enforcement and using it as a means to get what you want. If the author is primarily motivated by the financial loss rather than the illegal activity itself, that could make their action unethical. \n\nAlso, there's the question of whether the author has enough evidence. Just smelling weed and the customer being high might not be sufficient for a police report. Without clear evidence, the report could be seen as a false accusation. \n\nAnother angle is the employer's policy. Maybe the restaurant has a protocol for such situations. The author should check if they're supposed to report anything, but again, the reason matters. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong legally if they genuinely believe a crime is being committed. However, ethically, using the situation to get tips back could be considered wrong because it's using the threat of legal action for personal gain. The author's main grievance is financial, so the report might be seen as an abuse of the legal system for that reason. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because their motivation is primarily about the tips, not the illegal activity itself.\n"
