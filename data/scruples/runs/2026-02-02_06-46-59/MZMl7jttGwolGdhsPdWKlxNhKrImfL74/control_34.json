Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to report a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and is smoking weed, which is illegal where they live. The customer leaves $0.00 in the tip, and the driver feels they lose money on each delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer could be breaking the law. However, the driver's main issue is not about the weed itself but the lack of tips. The question is whether the driver is justified in using the weed as a reason to report the customer. \n\nThere's a difference between a legal issue and a personal grievance. The driver is upset about not getting tipped, which is a financial issue. Using the weed as a way to get the customer into trouble might be seen as using a legal technicality to resolve a personal conflict. That could be problematic because the driver's primary motive is the lack of tips, not the weed use itself. \n\nAlso, the driver mentions they don't have a problem with people smoking weed personally, but since it's illegal, they think reporting is an option. However, the right to report should be based on genuine concern for the law, not just as a means to get back at someone for not tipping. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone uses another person's legal violation as a tool to address a separate issue (like not getting tips), that could be considered unethical. The driver could be seen as taking advantage of the situation to settle a personal score. \n\nMoreover, the driver's responsibility is to deliver the pizza correctly and on time, which they're doing. The customer's choice to use weed, while illegal, is a personal choice they make on their property. Unless the driver has proof that the customer is using or possessing weed during the delivery (which might be hard to confirm), reporting them could be based on a suspicion rather than evidence. \n\nAlso, the tip amount is a separate matter. The customer might not be required to tip, especially if they choose to leave $0.00. The driver relies on tips, but that's a common issue in service industries. The solution isn't to report someone for a legal violation they might be committing just because they're not tipping. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the driver's main issue is the lack of tips, and using the weed as a reason to report the customer seems like a misuse of the legal system for personal gain. Therefore, the driver might be in the wrong for using a legal technicality to address a personal financial grievance.\n"
