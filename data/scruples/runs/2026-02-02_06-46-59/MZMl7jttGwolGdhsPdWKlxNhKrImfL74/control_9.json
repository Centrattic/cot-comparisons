Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer to the police for not tipping multiple times, and the customer smells like weed each time. The user is in a place where weed is illegal. They mention that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting because they're high. The user is making $5 an hour and relies on tips.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer. The key points here are the legality of weed in their area, the customer's actions (not tipping), and the user's motivation.\n\nThe user argues that the customer is using illegal substances and not tipping. Reporting someone for drug use is a legal matter. If the user has reason to believe the customer is using an illegal drug (weed in this case), they might have a valid reason to report. However, the main intent here might be about the tips. The user is upset because the customer isn't tipping, which affects their income, and they're using the drug use as justification for reporting.\n\nBut wait, the user's primary role is to deliver pizza. They're not law enforcement. The act of reporting someone for drug use is a serious step. The user's motivation might be more about the lack of tips than the drug use. They mention that the customer is one of their farthest deliveries, causing them to lose money each time. So maybe the user is using the drug use as a way to justify reporting them for not tipping.\n\nLegally, if the user is reporting based on reasonable suspicion of illegal activity, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the main reason is revenge over tips, that's different. Also, the user might not be trained to assess whether the person is under the influence or using illegal substances. There's a risk of false accusations.\n\nBut in some places, citizens can report suspected illegal activities. However, the user's personal gain (tips) might cloud their judgment. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for reporting someone over not tipping, using their drug use as a reason. If the reporting is based on genuine suspicion of illegal activity, maybe not. But if it's a ploy to get tips, then yes, they're acting out of self-interest and could be in the wrong.\n\nThe user also mentions that the customer writes $0.00, indicating intentional non-tipping. So the user's frustration is valid regarding income. But mixing that with a potential legal report is problematic. The correct approach might be to address the tipping issue with the employer or through customer service, not involving the police unless there's a clear legal violation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user's primary motive might be the lack of tips rather than the drug use, which is illegal. They're using the drug use as a pretext to report the customer to get the tips they want. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because they're misusing their position as a delivery driver to report someone for a personal gain reason (tips) rather than a legitimate legal concern.\n"
