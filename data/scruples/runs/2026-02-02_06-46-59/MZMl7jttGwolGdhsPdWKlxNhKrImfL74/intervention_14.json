Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed because they haven't tipped them multiple times. The customer smells of weed each time, and the author feels they lose money on those deliveries. The author is concerned about being an asshole if they report the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the legal aspects. The user mentions that weed is illegal in their area. So, if the customer is using an illegal substance, technically, that's against the law. However, the driver is considering reporting them based on the smell and lack of tipping. But wait, the driver's evidence is circumstantial. Just because someone smells like weed doesn't prove they're actively using it at the time of delivery. Plus, the customer might have used it earlier and the smell lingers. There's no direct evidence here.\n\nThen there's the issue of tipping. The customer deliberately enters $0.00 as a tip. That's their right. Tipping is voluntary, and while it's disappointing, it's not illegal. The driver's income relies on tips, which is a common issue for service workers, but that doesn't give them the right to retaliate by reporting someone for something else. The driver is conflating two separate issues: lack of tips and illegal activity. \n\nThe driver's motivation here is a bit concerning. They might be using the illegal activity as a reason to get back at the customer for not tipping. That could be a form of entrapment or misuse of legal processes for personal gain. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's intent to report them out of spite for not tipping could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the customer's choice to consume weed, even if illegal, is their personal decision. The driver's job is to deliver the order, not to police the customer's actions unless there's a direct threat or violation involving them. Unless there's an immediate danger, the driver isn't in a position to enforce the law. \n\nSo, legally, the customer's actions might be illegal, but the driver's intent to report them based on circumstantial evidence and personal financial grievances could lead to misuse of the legal system. The driver is overstepping by using a legal violation as a means to retaliate against unfair tipping. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such an action without proper evidence and with the wrong intent.\n"
