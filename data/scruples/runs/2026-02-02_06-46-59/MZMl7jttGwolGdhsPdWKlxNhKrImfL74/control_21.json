Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's been reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting this person.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the user mentions that weed is illegal where they live. If the customer is smoking weed, then technically, the user isn't doing anything illegal by reporting it. But maybe there's a nuance. For example, maybe the customer is in their own home, so the police might not act unless there's a disturbance. The user might be right in reporting a crime, but if it's just someone using a substance in their home, maybe the police won't do anything, leading to wasted time.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The user is upset because the customer doesn't tip, which affects their income. They make $5 an hour plus tips, so relying on tips is part of their job. The customer writes $0.00 each time, which is intentional. The user feels they're losing money on that delivery. So, the user's motivation might be financial, which complicates the moral judgment. Are they using the weed as an excuse to report someone just because they don't like the tips? That could be seen as using the law for personal gain, which might make them an asshole.\n\nAlso, the user mentions they have no issue with weed personally. So the issue isn't the weed itself but the lack of tip. But if the customer is under the influence, maybe the user is blaming them for not tipping. However, the customer is choosing to not tip, not forgetting. The user could argue that the customer is being stingy, but the user is taking it to the police because of that. That could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, even if the customer is breaking the law.\n\nAnother angle: the user's job is to deliver food. They shouldn't be enforcing the law. Maybe it's not their role to police other people's activities. So even if the customer is breaking the law, the user might not be the right person to report them, especially if their main grievance is about tips. That could be considered using the law for personal reasons.\n\nAlso, the customer might be under the influence but still making conscious decisions not to tip. The user is taking it personally. The user's main issue is financial, but using the law to address that could be seen as unethical. So the user might be in the wrong because their primary motive is to get a tip, not to enforce the law. They're using the weed as a pretext to report someone, which is morally questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user isn't breaking the law by reporting, their intention to get better tips makes their action morally questionable. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
