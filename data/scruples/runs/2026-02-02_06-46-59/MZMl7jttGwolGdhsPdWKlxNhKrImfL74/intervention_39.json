Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip them and is smoking weed when he's given deliveries. The driver is upset because they lose money on these deliveries and the customer writes $0.00 in the tip. The driver is in a place where weed is illegal, so they think reporting him for that is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the person is smoking weed in a state where it's illegal, then technically, the driver could report them. But wait, is the driver allowed to report someone just for smoking weed? Maybe the driver is overstepping their role here. The police usually handle such reports, but maybe the driver is using this as a way to get back at the customer for not tipping. That could be a motive, which might not be the right reason for a report.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The driver's main complaint is about not getting tipped. The customer is choosing not to tip, which is their right as a consumer. Even if the customer is high, the act of not tipping isn't illegal. The driver relies on tips for income, so this is a financial issue. However, using the law (reporting for weed use) as a way to enforce tipping could be exploiting the legal system for personal gain. That seems unethical.\n\nAlso, the driver mentions they lose money on this delivery because it's a far distance. They might be frustrated, but the solution of reporting someone for a civil matter (tipping) via a criminal charge (weed use) is problematic. It's mixing two different issues. The driver could instead address the tipping issue by maybe not delivering to that customer or asking for tips, but using the law as a weapon here could be wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the customer is choosing not to tip, which is their right. The driver is using a legal but morally questionable method to retaliate. Even if weed is illegal, if the customer is using it in their home, maybe that's a privacy issue. Unless the driver has evidence of illegal activity beyond just smelling weed, which is hard to prove, reporting them could be a false report.\n\nSo putting it all together, the driver's motive is primarily about money, using the weed smoking as a pretext. That makes the report unethical and possibly illegal if it's a false report. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
