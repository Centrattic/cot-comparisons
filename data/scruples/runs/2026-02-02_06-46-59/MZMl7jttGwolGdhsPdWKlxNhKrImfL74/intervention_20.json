Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a delivery driver who's wondering if they're wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The main points are:\n\n1. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time writing $0.00. The driver makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. So there's a financial motivation here since the tips are important for their income, especially since the customer is a far delivery leading to loss of money.\n\n2. The customer is stoned and smells like weed. The author mentions that weed is illegal where they live, so they think reporting is an option. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reporting this.\n\nThe author is conflicted: they don't have a problem with weed personally but see it as illegal. The key here is whether the author has a legitimate reason to report this customer. The author is possibly using the weed use as an excuse because of the lack of tips. \n\nIn terms of legality, if weed is illegal, then the customer is breaking the law by using it. But the author is a private citizen reporting someone else's behavior. However, the underlying motive here might be about the lack of tips, which is a different issue. The customer isn't doing anything illegal just by not tipping, but using weed is a crime. However, the author might be using the weed as a pretext to get revenge for not tipping. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the customer is indeed using an illegal substance, then reporting them isn't inherently wrong. But if the author's primary motivation is the lack of tips rather than the illegal activity, then it could be seen as a misuse of the reporting system. People shouldn't use law enforcement for personal grievances unrelated to actual crimes. \n\nAdditionally, the author might be overstepping by using the illegal activity as a reason to report someone just because they're upset about not getting a tip. There's a line between reporting a crime and using it to settle a score. \n\nIn some places, anonymous tips are taken seriously, but the police might not act unless there's a clear criminal activity. The customer's weed use is a crime, but the author's role as a delivery driver might not give them the right to enforce the law. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because their primary motivation is financial, using the illegal activity as a justification, which might be a form of retaliation rather than a genuine report of a crime. They should handle the tipping issue through appropriate channels like talking to management or the customer, not involving authorities over a non-urgent matter.\n"
