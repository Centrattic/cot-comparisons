Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed because they haven't tipped. The key points here are the legality of weed where they live, the customer's behavior, and the driver's financial situation.\n\nFirst, the driver mentions that the customer hasn't tipped four times. The customer is always stoned and smells like weed. The driver is losing money on each delivery because it's a far location. They make $5 an hour and rely on tips. The customer intentionally sets the tip to $0.00, not forgetting due to being high.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the driver is in the wrong for considering reporting the customer. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate the situation from different angles.\n\nLegally, if weed is illegal in the area, then the driver could report it. However, the context is that the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips. The driver is using the weed as a reason to report the customer. This could be seen as using a legal technicality to punish someone for not tipping. \n\nEthically, is it right to report someone for a personal grievance? The driver's primary issue is financial\u2014receiving no tips. Using the police to address this might be disproportionate. Also, the customer's actions (smoking weed) are a separate issue from the tip. Even if the tip was a problem, reporting for a non-criminal issue (like not tipping) via a crime (smoking weed) could be seen as a misuse of police resources.\n\nAdditionally, the driver has a responsibility to provide service without taking personal vendettas into account. The customer's choice to use weed, while illegal, might be a private matter unless it's affecting the driver's safety or well-being. Since there's no mention of threat, just smell and possible stoned state, the driver's motivation is more about the tips.\n\nSo, while the act of smoking weed is illegal, the driver's intent to report might be driven by personal financial grievances rather than genuine concern for legal compliance. This could mean the driver is in the wrong for using the legal system to address a personal issue.\n"
