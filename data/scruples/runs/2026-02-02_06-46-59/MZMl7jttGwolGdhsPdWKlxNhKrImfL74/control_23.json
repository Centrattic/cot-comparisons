Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who is considering reporting a customer to the police because the customer hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems to be smoking weed. The key points here are legality and personal gain.\n\nFirst, the user is concerned about the customer using illegal substances. In their state, weed is illegal. So the user thinks the customer is breaking the law. But wait, the user's main reason for wanting to report them is the lack of tips, not the weed itself. They mention that the customer writes $0 in the tip, which affects their income since they rely on tips. \n\nThe user is asking if they'd be an asshole for reporting the customer. The question is whether they're in the wrong. So, the main issue here is the user's motivation. If they're reporting the customer primarily to get a tip, that's self-serving and possibly unethical. \n\nEven though the customer is breaking the law, using that as a pretext to get money from the police is problematic. The user could lose their job if the police check on the customer and find that there's no issue. Also, the user might be exposing themselves to legal risks if the report is found to be a false report or made with malicious intent. \n\nAdditionally, the user's right to report someone is there, but the intent matters. The user might have a valid concern about the illegal activity, but if the main drive is financial gain, that's a conflict of interest. \n\nOn the other hand, if the user genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law, they might have a duty to report it regardless of personal feelings. But in this case, the user's own statements suggest that they don't have a problem with smoking per se, just the lack of tips. \n\nSo, the user is using the weed as an excuse to report someone they're upset about not tipping. That's using a legal issue as a cover for personal gain, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
