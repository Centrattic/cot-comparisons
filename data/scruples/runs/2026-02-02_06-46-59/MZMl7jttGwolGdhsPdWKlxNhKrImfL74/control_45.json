Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and smells like weed. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a delivery driver who makes $5 an hour and relies on tips. The customer in question hasn't tipped four times, and each time, the author noticed the customer was stoned and smelled like weed. The author is considering reporting them because it's illegal where they live. Also, the customer is one of the farthest, so the delivery actually costs the author money.\n\nSo, the key points here are: reporting someone for a possible crime (smoking weed), using the lack of tipping as a motive, and the impact on the author's income.\n\nNow, the ethical question is whether the author is justified. Legally, if the customer is indeed using an illegal substance, the author might have a right to report it. However, the main issue here is the author's motive. They're using the customer's non-tip (which could be seen as a business-related issue) as a reason to report a potential criminal activity. That could be problematic because it's using a personal grievance to enforce something that's supposed to be a public concern. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of privacy. The author is observing the customer's personal behavior (smelling of weed) and deciding to report them. If the customer is indeed smoking weed, it's illegal, but if the author is using this as a pretext to get back at someone for not tipping, that's crossing a line. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a delivery driver. Their role is to provide a service. If the customer is stoned, maybe the author's safety could be a concern, but there's no mention of that here. The main issue is the lack of tips and the author's financial loss due to the delivery distance. \n\nIn terms of ethics, using someone's illegal activity as a way to punish them for not tipping might be seen as exploiting a legal system for personal gain. That could make the author an asshole because they're not reporting for a public good reason but for personal reasons. \n\nBut then again, if the customer is breaking the law, the author isn't necessarily wrong for reporting it. However, the context of their motive is crucial here. If the author is primarily upset about the tips and using the weed as an excuse, that's different from genuinely concerned about illegal activity. \n\nAlso, the customer explicitly writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's intentional, not a mistake. The author's financial situation is hard, relying on tips, so losing money on that delivery is a real issue. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, it's against the law to report someone solely based on suspicion without reasonable cause. But if the author has a reasonable belief that the customer is using an illegal substance, they might be justified. However, the line between reporting for safety and reporting for revenge is thin here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's main motivation seems to be the lack of tips and financial loss, using the weed as a reason to report. That's likely where the ethical issue lies. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're using a personal grievance to report someone for a crime, which is not the right motive.\n"
