Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a delivery driver who's asking if they're a bad person for reporting a customer to the police because the customer doesn't tip and smells like weed. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, the key points: The customer hasn't tipped four times, and the author believes they smell like weed. The author is considering reporting them because they think it's illegal where they live. The author is a delivery driver earning $5 an hour and relying on tips.\n\nSo, is it legal to report someone for smoking weed? If weed is illegal in that area, then the author is reporting a possible crime. However, the author's main grievance is about not getting tipped. The customer is choosing to tip $0, which might be their right. The author might feel wronged because they lose money on the delivery, but the customer's choice to not tip doesn't automatically mean they're doing something illegal unless the author has evidence that the customer is using an illegal substance, which the smell might indicate.\n\nBut wait, can the author just smell weed and report without any proof? The customer could be using a legal product, or maybe it's just a strong aroma. The author might be misjudging. Also, the act of reporting someone to the police for something they suspect without concrete evidence could be problematic. The police might not take it seriously without proof. So, the author might be overstepping by using the police to address a personal financial issue. The author's main issue is about money, not an actual crime. Reporting someone for not tipping isn't a criminal act, unless there's another factor. So the author's motivation is more about the tips than the weed use. Therefore, the author is mixing two issues: the customer's behavior and their own financial loss. The author might be in the wrong because they're using a possible illegal activity as leverage for their personal gain, which could be seen as a misuse of the legal system. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
