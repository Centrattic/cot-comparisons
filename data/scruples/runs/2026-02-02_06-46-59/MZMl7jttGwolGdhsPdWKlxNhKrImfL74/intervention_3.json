Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the delivery driver is in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is stoned. The driver claims the customer hasn't tipped four times, and each time the customer was smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The driver wants to report them, but they also mention that they don't have a problem with weed personally but are upset about the lost tips and the fact that it's a far delivery causing them to lose money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal where they are, then using it is against the law. However, the driver is a third party here. Do they have the right to report someone just because they see them using an illegal substance? Reporting someone's private behavior could infringe on their rights, unless the driver witnessed a crime being committed. But wait, the act of using weed is a crime, so maybe the driver can report it. But the problem is that the driver is using their own vendetta against the customer for not tipping. That could be a conflict of interest. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The driver relies on tips for their income, which is a common practice in service jobs. The customer is giving $0.00, which is their choice, even if the driver feels it's unfair. However, the customer might be under the influence, which could affect their judgment. But the driver is choosing to report them not just because of the tips but because they want to get them in trouble. That seems like a personal vendetta. \n\nAlso, the driver's main issue is the lost tips and the distance of the delivery. The fact that the customer is smoking weed is an added reason to report them. Is the driver using the weed as an excuse to retaliate for the lack of tips? That's a big question. If the driver had a legitimate reason to believe the customer was engaging in illegal activity unrelated to the tips, maybe it's different. But here, the driver is combining both issues: the customer's illegal activity and their own financial grievances. \n\nIn terms of the law, if the driver is a private citizen, they can report crimes, but they should consider the accuracy and intent behind the report. If the driver is doing this out of spite rather than genuine concern for the law, it could be considered malicious. Additionally, the customer's right to privacy might be involved. The driver can't just monitor their behavior beyond the delivery interaction. \n\nOn the other hand, if the driver is genuinely concerned about illegal activity, they might have a right to report. But the key here is that the driver is using this as a way to get back at a customer for not tipping. That's the crux. The author is in the wrong if they are using a legitimate legal issue as a pretext for revenge. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the driver's primary motivation is financial, using the illegal weed as a reason to report someone they're upset with. That's a personal vendetta and misuse of their right to report crimes. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
