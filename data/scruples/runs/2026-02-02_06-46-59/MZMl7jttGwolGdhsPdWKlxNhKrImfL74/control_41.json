Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is a delivery driver who's asking if they'd be a bad person for reporting a customer who doesn't tip them and seems to be smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the customer doesn't tip four times, and the driver smells weed. The driver mentions that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's not a mistake. The driver relies on tips since they make $5 an hour. Also, the delivery is far, so they lose money each time.\n\nThe key points here are about the legality of weed where they live, the driver's financial reliance on tips, and the ethical dilemma of reporting someone for not tipping versus the potential legal issue.\n\nBut wait, the driver is considering reporting the customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. Is it their place to report someone for that? Even if it's illegal, the driver might be using the weed as an excuse to report the non-tipping customer. There's a conflict here between personal ethics and financial interests.\n\nOn one hand, the customer isn't tipping, which is frustrating for the driver. On the other, using the customer's potential illegal activity as a reason to report them could be seen as taking advantage of the situation for personal gain. The driver might be trying to get the customer to tip by threatening or actually reporting them, which could be seen as blackmail or misuse of information.\n\nAlso, the driver isn't in a position to enforce the law. They might not have proof of the customer using weed, just an observation. Reporting someone based on smell and assumption could lead to false accusations. The legal system usually requires evidence, and the driver's report might not hold up without proof.\n\nBut the driver's financial situation is real. They rely on tips, and this customer is costing them money. However, the ethical thing might be to address the tipping issue directly, maybe by talking to the customer or the employer, rather than using a potential illegal activity as leverage.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they report the customer for a non-tipping issue under the pretense of illegal activity, that's using the law for personal gain, which is unethical. However, if the driver genuinely believes the customer is violating the law, even if the main issue is the tips, they might think they're doing the right thing legally. But since the main motivation is financial, it's more about using a legal threat to get what they want, which makes them the villain. So the answer would be A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
