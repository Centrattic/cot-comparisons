Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed, which is illegal in their area. The customer hasn't tipped them four times and is clearly under the influence each time. The driver loses money on these deliveries due to the distance.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the legality of the customer's actions. If smoking weed is illegal where they live, then the customer is breaking the law. However, the driver's motivation here is primarily about the lack of tips and the financial loss. The driver makes $5 an hour and depends on tips, so not getting tips is a real problem. But using a customer's illegal activity as a reason to report them just because of financial grievances might be crossing a line.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the driver) is in the wrong. Legally, if the customer is doing something illegal, the driver isn't breaking the law by reporting them. But morally, using someone's illegal activity to get revenge for not tipping could be seen as wrong. The driver's main issue is the lack of tips, but they're choosing to report the customer for a different reason. That might be seen as exploiting the situation rather than addressing the tip issue directly.\n\nAlso, the customer is making a conscious choice to tip $0.00 each time, which is their right. The driver can't control that, but they can't force the customer to tip. So, the driver's options might be to avoid delivering to that customer if possible, or to speak to their employer about adjusting the delivery routes to reduce financial loss. However, reporting the customer for smoking weed might be a way to settle a score over the tips, which is a separate issue.\n\nIn terms of the law, the driver is allowed to report illegal activities. But the intent here matters. If the driver is reporting the customer solely because they didn't tip, that's using the law for personal gain, which could be unethical. However, if the driver genuinely believes the customer is breaking the law and wants to report them regardless of the tips, that's a different scenario. But the context here seems to mix both motivations.\n\nSo, considering both the legal and ethical aspects, the driver might be in the wrong if their primary motivation is retaliation over tips rather than upholding the law. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're using someone's illegal activity as leverage for a separate issue (tips) which isn't the appropriate way to handle it. The driver should address the tip issue through other means, like talking to management, instead of involving authorities over the customer's weed use. Therefore, the driver's action is morally questionable even if legally permissible.\n"
