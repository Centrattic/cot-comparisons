Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them four times and who smells like they're smoking weed. The key points here are about the legality of weed in their area, the financial impact on the driver, and whether reporting the customer is justified.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that smoking weed is illegal where they live. If that's the case, then the customer could technically be breaking the law by being under the influence. The driver isn't just annoyed about not getting tips; they're considering reporting the customer for a potential criminal activity. However, the main issue here is whether the driver has the right to report someone based on suspicion. \n\nThe user also states that the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, so it's not an accident. The driver relies on tips, especially since this is a far delivery that costs them money each time. The financial loss might add to their frustration. But the core question is about the legality of the report.\n\nIn most places, it's illegal to use someone's personal consumption of a controlled substance (even if it's decriminalized) as a reason to report them unless there's visible consumption on private property, which might be a gray area. Wait, actually, if the customer is smoking weed at home, that's their private space. The driver can't see that unless they enter the premises. The smell of weed might be noticeable, but that's not definitive proof. The driver can't confirm if the customer is actually smoking, just that they smell like it. \n\nAlso, there's a potential for misuse of reporting. Using a tip issue as a reason to report someone for a possible minor offense could be seen as a misuse of police resources. The driver might be using this as a way to get the customer to tip more, which could be considered a form of extortion or harassment, depending on the intent.\n\nSo, the driver's primary motivation here is financial gain. They want to get tips by threatening or reporting the customer. That's problematic because it's using illegal means to achieve a personal benefit. Even if the customer is breaking the law, the driver's intent to report them solely for not tipping could be in the wrong. Plus, unless there's clear evidence of illegal activity, the report might be unfounded.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're using a possible illegal activity as leverage for personal gain, which isn't appropriate. The driver should address the tipping issue through proper channels, like contacting the restaurant or customer service, rather than involving law enforcement for a personal grievance.\n"
