Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a pizza delivery driver who's considering reporting a customer for smoking weed. The customer hasn't tipped them multiple times, and the driver thinks they lose money on each delivery. The customer is stoned and smells like weed each time. The driver isn't against weed personally but points out it's illegal in their area.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether reporting someone for smoking weed is justified here. The key points are: the customer is not tipping, the driver is losing money, and they want to report them for a possible law violation.\n\nWeed legality is a factor. If weed is illegal where they live, then the customer could be breaking the law. But the driver's main grievance is about not getting tipped. So, is reporting them for weed use a valid reason, or is it just revenge for not getting tips?\n\nThe driver mentions the customer writes $0.00 in the tip section, not forgetting. The driver's income relies on tips. However, reporting someone for a personal activity (even if illegal) might be considered an overreach, especially if the main motive is revenge. The customer's weed use isn't affecting the driver directly, except through the tips. The driver could argue they're reporting a law violation, but if the main reason is to get a tip, that's problematic.\n\nAlso, the customer's use of weed in their own home is their choice, even if illegal. The driver isn't a law enforcement officer, so they shouldn't be the one to report unless there's a direct harm. The driver's anger over not getting tips might be the real issue here. So, the author might be in the wrong because using the law as a means to get a tip is not appropriate. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their motivation is personal gain rather than a genuine concern for illegal activity.\n"
