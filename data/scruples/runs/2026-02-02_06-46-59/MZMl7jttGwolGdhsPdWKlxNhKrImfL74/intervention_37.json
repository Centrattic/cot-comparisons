Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally.

I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a delivery driver for a pizza place. They're asking if they'd be a bad person (WIBTA) for reporting a customer who hasn't tipped them multiple times and seems to be smoking weed. \n\nFirst, the key points here are: the customer didn't tip four times, and each time they smelled of marijuana. The driver mentions that weed is illegal where they live, so maybe that's a factor. Also, the customer is one of their farthest deliveries, causing them to lose money, and they rely on tips since they make $5 an hour. \n\nSo the question is whether the driver is wrong to report the customer for smoking weed. Let's think about the legal aspect first. If weed is illegal in their area, using it is a crime. So if the driver reports someone for that, it's technically a legal action. But wait, does that make it right? The driver's motivation here is not just about the weed but also about the lack of tips. They might be using the weed as an excuse because the customer didn't tip. That could be a problem. \n\nEthically, snitching on someone for a personal reason might not be the best approach. The customer could be smoking weed, but the driver's main grievance is the lack of tips. Maybe the driver is looking for a reason to report the customer because they're upset about the money. That could be seen as using a legal issue to settle a personal financial grievance. \n\nAlso, the customer explicitly put $0.00 in the tip section each time, which shows intent not to tip, not that they forgot. The driver's hourly wage is low, and tips are crucial. That's a valid financial concern. But does that justify reporting the customer? \n\nAnother angle: the police might not take the report seriously if the driver is primarily motivated by the lack of tips. They might see it as a minor issue compared to the actual illegal activity. However, if the customer is indeed using an illegal substance, then technically, the driver is reporting a crime. But the driver's intent here might be a factor. \n\nWhat about the driver's responsibility? Are they supposed to report every instance of illegal activity they observe? That could set a problematic precedent. Plus, the customer could argue that the driver is overstepping, especially if the primary issue is the tip. \n\nIn terms of morality, the driver might feel wronged because they're not getting paid properly, but using a legal charge against the customer might be seen as underhanded. The customer's choice to use weed is their own, even if illegal, and the driver's job is to deliver pizza, not enforce the law. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the driver's main issue is financial, but they're using a legal report as a means to address it. That seems like a misuse of the legal system for personal gain, which could make them the wrong person here. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
