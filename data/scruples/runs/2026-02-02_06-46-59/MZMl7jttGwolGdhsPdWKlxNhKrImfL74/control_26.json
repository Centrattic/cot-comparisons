Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the pizza delivery driver is wrong for considering reporting a customer for smoking weed because the customer didn't tip multiple times. The driver mentions that the customer smells like weed, isn't tipping, and they lose money on the delivery. They make $5 an hour and need tips.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal in their area, then the customer could be breaking the law by using it. But the driver's job is to deliver pizza, not enforce the law. However, if the driver sees something illegal, maybe they have a duty to report it? But wait, the customer is in their own home, right? So unless the driver is witnessing a crime in progress, like smoking in a public place where it's prohibited, maybe. But the customer is just sitting there stoned. The driver can't just report someone for using an illegal substance in their own home if they're not actively doing it in front of the driver. The smell might be a clue, but it's not proof. So maybe the driver doesn't have enough evidence to report the person.\n\nThen there's the tipping issue. The customer is choosing not to tip, which is their right. The driver is frustrated because they need the tips, especially since the delivery is far and they lose money. But the customer isn't obligated to tip, even if they're high. The driver might feel they're being punished because the customer isn't tipping, but the customer's choice to not tip is separate from their personal behavior. The driver's motivation here is financial, which could be seen as using the law as a tool to get the tips they want. That might be unethical.\n\nSo, is the driver in the wrong? If they report the customer solely because they didn't tip, then yes, that's using illegal means to get what they want. But if they genuinely believe the customer is using illegal drugs and they see evidence (like the smell), maybe they have some grounds. However, without seeing the act itself, it's hard to prove. The driver's main grievance is not with the drug use but with the lack of tips. So the real issue is the financial motivation. Reporting someone for a crime they didn't witness could be a problem, especially if it's a false report. That would make the driver at fault.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their primary motive is the lack of tips, and they might not have valid evidence of a crime. They're using the illegal drug use as a reason to report someone for a financial grievance, which is not appropriate.\n"
