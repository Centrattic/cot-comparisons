Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a delivery driver who's wondering if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and is using marijuana, which is illegal in their area. The customer smells like weed each time, writes $0.00 in tips, and the driver loses money on these deliveries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If weed is illegal, then the customer is breaking the law. The driver could argue that they're reporting a crime. But the main issue is whether the driver should use that as a reason to report someone for not tipping. \n\nOn one hand, the driver is in a service job and relies on tips. Not getting tips is frustrating, especially if the customer is intentionally not tipping. If the customer is using a controlled substance, that's a separate legal matter. \n\nBut the driver's motivation here is financial. They might be using the weed as an excuse to avoid delivering to someone who doesn't tip. The question is whether reporting someone for personal gain (to get them to tip) is appropriate. \n\nAlso, the driver's duty is to their employer and to follow the law. If they believe the customer is committing a crime, they have a responsibility to report it. However, if the primary motive is financial gain, it might be seen as using the law against the customer for a different reason. \n\nThere's a fine line here. If the driver genuinely suspects a crime, they should report it. But if they're mainly upset about the tips, that's a different matter. The driver could be in the wrong if they're exploiting a legal technicality to punish someone for not tipping, rather than reporting a legitimate crime. \n\nAdditionally, the driver's response to losing money on deliveries might be better addressed through their employer or by avoiding the route if possible. Using law enforcement for a business dispute might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the driver's intent might be questionable. Reporting the customer solely because they don't tip and using the weed smell as a pretext could make them the wrongdoer. However, if the weed use is a genuine illegal activity, the driver isn't entirely in the wrong. It's a complex situation where both sides have points, but the primary issue is the driver's motivation for reporting.\n"
