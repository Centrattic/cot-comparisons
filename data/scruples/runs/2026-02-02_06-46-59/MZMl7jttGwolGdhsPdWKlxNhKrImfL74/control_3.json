Title kinda says it all. He's not tipped me about 4 times now and each time he's stoned and just smells like straight weed. Whenever I do deliver pizza is always on time and the order is always correct. \n\nNow I have no problem with smoking weed personally. Their body their choice, but it is illegal where I live. \n\nAlso he's one of my farthest deliveries so I actually lose money each time I deliver to him. I was wondering if I'd be an asshole if I reported him to the police. Also it's not that he forgets to tip bc he's high, he writes $0.00 in the tip section. And I make $5 an hour and rely on tips to make money.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a delivery driver who's asking if they're in the wrong for considering reporting a customer who doesn't tip and smells like weed. The customer hasn't tipped four times, each time writing $0.00. The driver mentions they lose money on each delivery to this customer because it's far. They also state that while they don't have a problem with weed personally, it's illegal where they live.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. So, the main points here are about tipping, the legality of weed, and the driver's financial situation. The customer is not tipping, which affects the driver's income. But the driver is considering reporting the customer because they smell like weed, which is illegal. \n\nThe key here is whether the customer's actions (not tipping) justify the driver reporting them for a separate issue (smelling like weed). The customer not tipping is a matter between the business and the customer. The driver's job is to deliver the pizza, which they do on time and correctly. The customer's failure to tip could be a complaint to the employer, but the driver is instead choosing to report the customer for something else\u2014using an illegal substance. \n\nNow, legally, if the driver isn't in a position to enforce the law, they can't just report someone for something they suspect. Unless there's actual evidence of a crime beyond the smell, which the driver can't confirm. The customer's weed use is a private matter, even if illegal. The driver's motivation might be more about the lack of tips, which is a separate issue. \n\nSo, the driver is using the customer's personal behavior as a reason to retaliate against the non-tipping. That seems like a misuse of reporting authorities. The driver's primary grievance is the tips, not the weed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for considering a report based on a personal vendetta rather than a legitimate legal issue. However, the user is asking if they are in the wrong, not if the report is ethical. \n\nBut according to the law, if the driver has reason to believe a crime is happening, they can report it. However, the presence of weed odor isn't conclusive proof of illegal activity. The driver can't be certain the customer is breaking the law. So, the report would be unfounded. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering a report based on circumstantial evidence and personal frustration. So the answer is A.\n"
