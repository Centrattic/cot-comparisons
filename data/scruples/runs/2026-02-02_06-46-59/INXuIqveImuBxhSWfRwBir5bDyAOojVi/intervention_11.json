Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is they were at the grocery store, had some health issues that make it hard for them to bend over. They saw something on the floor, asked the person in front if they dropped it, got a no, and then another woman pushed past and said \"Fine just leave it then.\" The writer tried to explain their joint problem but the woman dismissed them, called them a \"lazy millennial,\" and then the writer called her a \"cunt.\"\n\nFirst, the writer's health issues are significant\u2014spinal stenosis, arthritis, etc. That's valid. They can't bend down, so picking up the item wasn't possible. The other woman didn't seem to acknowledge their limitations and made an accusation. The writer was already in pain, which probably made their response more emotional. \n\nBut the key point here is the use of an insult. The writer says they called the woman a \"cunt.\" Even if the woman was rude, using a swear word like that is probably uncalled for. The question is whether the writer overreacted. \n\nThe writer's friend said they were being an asshole, and the friend might be right. While the woman was rude, responding with an insult can escalate the situation. The writer could have walked away instead of retaliating. However, considering their health challenges and the stress of the situation, maybe their reaction was a bit understandable. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, using a derogatory term is generally not acceptable. Even if provoked, it's better to respond calmly. The writer might not be entirely in the wrong because they were dealing with pain and a dismissive person, but they still made a choice to insult someone. So the answer might be A (yes, they're in the wrong) because they could have handled it differently without the insult.\n"
