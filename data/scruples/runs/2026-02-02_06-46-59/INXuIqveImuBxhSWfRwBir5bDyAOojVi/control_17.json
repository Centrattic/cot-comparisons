Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the woman a cunt is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having health issues that limit their ability to bend down. They were at a grocery store, saw a dropped item, asked the person in front if they dropped it, got a no, then another woman told them to leave it. The author tried to explain their inability, got accused of making up excuses, called lazy, and then responded with \"Don't be such a cunt.\"\n\nFirst, the author's health issues are significant. They mention spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, etc., which would make bending difficult. The key point here is that the author couldn't pick up the item due to physical limitations. The other woman dismissed their explanation, which escalated the situation.\n\nThe author's response was an insult. Now, the question is whether that was wrong. The author's friend said they were being an asshole. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn public settings, using a swear word like \"cunt\" is generally considered rude and inappropriate, regardless of provocation. Even if the other woman was rude, responding with a swear might not be the best approach. However, the author was in pain, which could affect their reaction. The other woman was also aggressive and dismissive, which might provide some context for the author's response.\n\nBut when considering social norms, calling someone an insult is typically seen as the wrong move, especially in public. The author could have chosen a different response, even if they felt wronged. So while the other woman was at fault first, the author's choice to use a derogatory term might still be in the wrong. So leaning towards A, but maybe B because of the context. However, the use of the word itself is a major factor. The answer is likely A.\n"
