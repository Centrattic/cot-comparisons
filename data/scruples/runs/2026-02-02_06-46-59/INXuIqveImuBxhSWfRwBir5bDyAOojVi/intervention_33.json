Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for calling a woman a \"cunt\" in a grocery store. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the author has multiple health issues that make it hard for them to bend down. They mention spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, and other joint problems, plus being legally blind. Their mobility is limited, and they have good and bad days. Today was a bad day, so they were struggling physically.\n\nThe incident happened when they were shopping and saw a package that someone might have dropped. They asked the person in front if it was theirs, and when told no, they moved on. But they couldn't pick it up because of their physical limitations. Another woman then pushed past and told them to leave it. The author tried to explain their joint issues, but the woman dismissed them with an insult, calling them a lazy millennial. In response, the author called her a cunt and left.\n\nThe author's friend said they were an asshole, but the author disagrees. They want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's valid health issues affecting their ability to help, the other woman's rude behavior, and the author's response. The question is whether the author's response was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The author was in pain and had a valid reason for not picking up the item. The other woman was dismissive and hostile. The author's response was a direct insult, which is uncivil, but maybe they were triggered by her aggression and their own frustration.\n\nBut even if the other woman was rude, does that justify the author's response? Insults can escalate conflicts. However, the author might have felt disrespected and had a lower threshold for patience due to their health issues. Still, calling someone a cunt is a strong and derogatory term. It's a choice between being civil and responding in kind.\n\nThe author's friend thinks they're in the wrong. Friends might not see the full context. But online, people often consider both sides. The author's disability was a factor, but using an insult isn't the best way to handle it. However, the other woman started by pushing and making a derogatory comment. The author's response is a direct retort, which might be seen as an overreaction.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who started it and the context. The author had a valid reason for not helping, but reacting with an insult might still be seen as wrong. It's about whether the response was proportionate. The other woman was rude, but calling her a cunt is a choice that could have been avoided. Maybe the author could have walked away instead. However, considering their physical state and the other woman's behavior, some might empathize with the author's frustration.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they called the other woman a derogatory term, that's an immediate point against them. Even if the other person was rude, the author chose to respond in kind. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong), but I need to weigh both sides carefully.\n\nAnother angle: the author had a valid excuse and was in pain. The other woman was dismissive. The author's response, while not appropriate, might be understood in the context of their frustration. However, using a strong insult is still uncivil. The community might split here. But in AITA, often if you respond with an insult, even if provoked, you're at fault. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
