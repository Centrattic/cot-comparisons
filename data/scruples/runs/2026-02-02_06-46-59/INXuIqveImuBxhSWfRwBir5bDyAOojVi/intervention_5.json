Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a person with significant health issues who called a woman a \"cunt\" in a grocery store.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has multiple health problems: spine issues, arthritis, cartilage degradation, and legal blindness. These conditions make it hard for them to bend down or walk. They were shopping and saw something dropped. They asked if the person in front dropped it, and they said no. The author couldn't pick it up themselves due to their physical limitations. Then another woman pushed past and told them to leave it. The author explained their condition, and the woman scoffed, accused them of making up excuses, called them a lazy millennial, and said something else. In response, the author called her a \"cunt.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. They're asking for a binary answer, A or B.\n\nSo, considering the context: the author was in pain and dealing with a frustrating situation. The other woman was dismissive and rude, which might have escalated the conflict. The author's comment was a direct response to that abuse. However, using a derogatory term like \"cunt\" is a strong reaction. Even though the woman was rude, the author's response was a personal insult. The author might argue self-defense in terms of being provoked, but the language used is definitely aggressive and offensive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had valid reasons for not being able to pick up the item\u2014real health issues. The woman's behavior was inconsiderate and possibly malicious. The author's response was an outburst, but maybe under the circumstances, they felt provoked. However, regardless of provocation, using a swear word like that in public is unprofessional and could be seen as contributing to the conflict. The question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nThe friend said the author was being an asshole, which is a common perspective. But others might empathize with the author's situation. The key here is that while the other woman was at fault, the author's choice of words is still inappropriate. So, even if the woman started it, the author is in the wrong for using such language. It's about accountability for one's own actions. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
