Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called a woman a \"cunt\" at the grocery store is in the wrong. The situation is complicated because the person has several health issues that limit their mobility. They tried to help by picking up a dropped item but couldn't because of their condition. Another woman dismissed them and made a derogatory comment, which led to the author responding with a swear word.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has valid health issues that make bending difficult. They tried to help but couldn't, so they explained their situation. The other woman reacted negatively, which escalated the situation. The author's response was an insult, which is pretty harsh.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even though the other woman was rude, using a strong swear word like \"cunt\" is generally considered inappropriate in public and can be seen as disrespectful. The author was already in pain, which might have affected their judgment. However, responding with an insult might not be the best approach, even if provoked.\n\nOn the other hand, the other woman's behavior was also inconsiderate. She didn't acknowledge the author's health issues and made a judgment. But that doesn't necessarily justify the author's response. People are expected to maintain a certain level of civility, even in heated moments. The author's friend also thinks they were being an asshole, which adds another perspective.\n\nSo, while the other woman's actions were rude, the author's use of a derogatory term is still problematic. It's a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils. The author could have responded differently, perhaps by walking away or explaining their situation again without the insult. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using an offensive term, even if provoked.\n"
