Spinel stenosis, osteoarthritis, and my cartilage are essentially being attacked by my body and being broken down and along with this being legally blind. So with all of that, I really can't bend down, walk very far, or walk without limping for the most part. I have good days and bad days like most people my bad days however just involve me being stuck in bed until my body decides to stop hating me. \n\nNow onto today's events, I was grocery shopping, minding my own damn business just trying to get some chicken noodle soup before a damn blizzard hit and I see a package of I think taco seasoning? Idk what it was, but I asked the person in front of me if they dropped it, they said no, and I went along. Now if I could have bend down and picked it up I would have, however, if I tried to do that today there's a 90% chance I would have been stuck bend over or at least in severe pain, and falling is a real possibility for me as I'm not good with balance.\n\nAnother woman in the isle pushes past me and says \"Fine just leave it then.\", I figured she just didn't know I had joint pains or didn't notice me limping around and turned to say \"Sorry, I have joint problems and can't really bend over.\" and she scoffs and says \"don't make up fake excuses\" and then calls me a 'lazy millennial' and said something else under her breath I couldn't quite catch, and typically I'm pretty rational but I'm already in pain and this lady struck a nerve so I said \"Don't be such a cunt\" and walked off to continue my shopping. \n\nWhen telling a friend of mine this, they said I was being an asshole to her. Personally, I don't think I was, she's the one pushing people aside and starting shit, so I figure I'd let the internet decide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for calling a woman a \"cunt\" at the grocery store. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has significant health issues that make it hard for them to bend down or walk properly. They were shopping and saw a package that someone might have dropped. They asked the person in front of them, who said no, so they moved on. Another woman in the aisle pushed past and told the author to leave it, then mocked them for making up excuses and called them a \"lazy millennial.\" The author, already in pain, responded by calling her a \"cunt.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants others' opinions. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider both sides. The woman's actions were rude and dismissive. She pushed past the author and insulted them, possibly aware of their disability. The author was in pain and their health conditions might have made the situation more stressful. However, responding with a derogatory term like \"cunt\" is a strong reaction. Even if provoked, using a swear word in public could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a situation where the author has a valid reason for not being able to bend down.\n\nBut the author's health issues are real and could make them more sensitive. The woman was being hostile without acknowledging their limitations. Maybe the author felt disrespected and their response was a momentary lapse in judgment. However, the author could have responded with a calmer explanation of their condition instead of a swear word. So, while the woman started the conflict, the author's choice of words escalated it unnecessarily. The key here is whether the response was proportionate. The author's health issues might mitigate some blame, but using such a strong insult still makes them at fault. So I lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
