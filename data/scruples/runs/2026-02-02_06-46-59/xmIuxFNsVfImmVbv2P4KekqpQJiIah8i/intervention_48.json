We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting boundaries with their son and daughter-in-law regarding babysitting for their future grandchildren. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author and his wife had their son when they were young, which impacted their ability to pursue their own goals. They raised him well but had to put their personal aspirations on hold. Now that their son is grown and starting a family, they want to focus on their own lives again. They made it clear they don't want to be babysitters, emphasizing that they won't be responsible for the grandchildren, won't provide free daycare, etc.\n\nThe son and daughter-in-law expected grandparental support, which is common in many families. The son was upset and felt it was a normal expectation. The author and wife explained that while they want to spend time with the kids, they won't be the primary caregivers. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In many families, grandparents do help with childcare, but it's not a given. The author is setting boundaries, which is their right. However, family dynamics can be complex. The son might feel the expectation was unspoken but inherent. \n\nThe key points are whether the author's stance is unreasonable. The parents are not refusing to be involved; they're just clarifying their role. They're not taking responsibility for raising the grandchildren but want to be present. The son might have assumed more caregiving from them, leading to conflict.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is valid. They had to sacrifice a lot for their son, and now they want their time back. It's reasonable for them to set limits. The daughter-in-law might also have different expectations. However, the author is not being hostile; they're being upfront. \n\nOn the other hand, setting such boundaries might come off as harsh, especially if the son didn't consider that his parents might need space. But the parents are clear that they still want to be part of the grandkids' lives without being primary caregivers. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are honest about their limits and not being dismissive, maybe not. They're not refusing all interaction, just not being babysitters. The son's reaction might be due to unspoken assumptions. The answer hinges on whether setting these boundaries is reasonable. Since they're stating their needs and not being abusive, probably not in the wrong.\n"
