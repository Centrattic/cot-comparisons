We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling their son and daughter-in-law they won't be babysitters for their grandkids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parents had their son young, which limited their own opportunities. They worked hard to raise him, but it wasn't their dream to have kids. Now their son is about to have a child, and they've decided they don't want to be primary caregivers or provide regular childcare. The son got upset, thinking grandparents should naturally want to spend time with their grandkids. The parents clarified they want to be involved but not as babysitters.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about boundaries and expectations. The parents are setting clear limits on their role. They\u2019re saying they\u2019ll be part of the grandkids' lives but not in a caretaking role. The son assumed that being grandparents means they have to be available for childcare, which the parents disagree with. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, family dynamics can be complicated. On one hand, the parents have a right to set their own boundaries. They have their own lives and goals they want to pursue. They\u2019re not obligated to provide childcare unless they choose to. On the other hand, the son might feel hurt because he expected a certain level of involvement from his parents as grandparents. \n\nCulturally, there's often an expectation that grandparents will help with childcare, but that's not a universal rule. The parents are being upfront about their intentions, which is honest. They\u2019re not saying they won\u2019t spend time with the kids at all, just not in a role that\u2019s a substitute for the parents. \n\nThe son's reaction is understandable but maybe stems from unspoken expectations. The parents\u2019 response is about mutual respect for each other\u2019s roles. They\u2019re not trying to be harsh but are asserting their own needs. So, in this case, the parents are not in the wrong. They\u2019re taking responsibility for their own lives while still expressing love and a desire to be part of their grandkids\u2019 lives on their terms. The answer should be B.\n"
