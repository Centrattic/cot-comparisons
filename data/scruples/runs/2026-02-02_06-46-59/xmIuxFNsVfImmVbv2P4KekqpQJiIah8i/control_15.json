We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent is refusing to be a babysitter for their future grandchildren. The parents are 47 and 45, had their son young, and have been working on their own lives since he's an adult. The son is upset because he expected the grandparents to help with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They had their son at a young age, which might have limited their own opportunities. They worked hard to support him, and now they feel it's their time to focus on their own goals. They're clear that they want to spend time with the grandkids but not as babysitters. They aren't refusing to have a relationship, just setting boundaries around childcare responsibilities.\n\nOn the son's side, he assumed that being grandparents would mean providing childcare. That's a common expectation, but maybe the parents are setting boundaries to protect their own lives. The son's reaction suggests he wasn't aware of their stance until that conversation, which might have come as a shock. However, the parents aren't saying they don't want to be involved; they're just clarifying their role.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural expectations or norms here. In many cultures, grandparents do help with childcare, but it's not a universal expectation. The key is communication. The parents could have talked about this earlier, but now that it's out in the open, they're being clear. The son's assumption might be based on not discussing it, so the conflict arises from unmet expectations.\n\nIs there anything wrong with setting boundaries? The parents are not obligated to be babysitters. They're making their intentions known. The son might need to adjust his expectations. The parents aren't rejecting the grandkids but are prioritizing their own time. The issue here is whether it's wrong to set such boundaries. From a legal or ethical standpoint, no one is entitled to another's time. However, family dynamics can be complex. The parents might be seen as selfish if they refuse all help, but they're not refusing to be involved\u2014they just don't want to take on the responsibility of childcare.\n\nThe answer would likely be B (No), because the parents are within their rights to set these boundaries. The son's expectations might be unreasonable if he hasn't considered his parents' needs. The parents are being upfront, which is better than assuming they'll be available.\n"
