We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandkids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents had a son when they were young, which disrupted their plans. They worked hard to provide for him, but now they want to focus on their own lives, doing things like certifications, travel, and hobbies. The son assumes they'll be available for babysitting, but the parents set boundaries. The son is upset, feeling they're being cold.\n\nSo the main issue here is about setting boundaries versus expectations. The parents are making it clear that they're not taking on the role of caregivers again. The son expects the traditional role of grandparents as active babysitters. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many cultures, grandparents do help with childcare. But it's also common for people to set personal boundaries, especially if they've had their own sacrifices. The parents here had to give up their plans for their son, so wanting to focus on their own lives now might be reasonable.\n\nIs it wrong to set such boundaries? Well, the parents are being honest and upfront, which is fair. They're not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely but are clarifying they won't be responsible for childcare. The son's reaction suggests he had an expectation that wasn't discussed before, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nI should also consider if the parents' communication was appropriate. They explained their reasons, which is better than a blanket refusal without explanation. The parents emphasized that they will be part of the grandkids' lives but not as substitutes for the parents. That seems reasonable. \n\nThe son's assumption that all grandparents want to be babysitters might be a cultural expectation he's projecting onto his parents. The parents have the right to decide how they want to engage with their grandkids. \n\nSo in this case, the parents aren't being inconsiderate; they're establishing clear boundaries to protect their own needs. They're not refusing to be involved, just not in the role of primary caregivers. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
