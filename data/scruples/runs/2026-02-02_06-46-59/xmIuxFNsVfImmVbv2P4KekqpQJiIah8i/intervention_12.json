We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the grandparents are saying they don't want to be babysitters for their grandkids. The parents (the son and daughter-in-law) expected the grandparents to help, but the grandparents made it clear they don't want to take on that role. Now the son is upset, thinking there's something wrong with his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they had their son very young and missed out on a lot of things they wanted to do. The mom didn't really want the child, which I think is a significant point. They worked hard to raise him, and now they feel like they can focus on their own lives. It's their time to do certifications, travel, hobbies, etc. So their reasoning is partly about reclaiming their lives and not being taken advantage of again.\n\nThe son made a joke about using the grandparents as babysitters, and the author took it seriously to set boundaries. The wife clarifies that they want to be part of the grandkids' lives but not as primary caregivers. The son reacts negatively, implying that grandparents should naturally take on that role. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, some might think grandparents are expected to help with childcare. But the key here is the grandparents' own situation and their right to set boundaries. The author and wife have a right to their own lives and priorities, especially if they were affected by their previous parenting experience. The son's assumption might be based on societal norms, but the grandparents' response was about their own well-being and not repeating past sacrifices.\n\nI should also consider if the communication was clear. The author didn't just say no, but explained their reasoning. The wife emphasized that they would be involved but not as babysitters. So it's not just a blanket refusal but a clarification of their role. The son's reaction seems to be from unmet expectations rather than a legitimate wrong. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's justified. The grandparents' stance is about their own needs and not being forced into a role they're not comfortable with. There's no obligation for grandparents to be babysitters unless there are specific circumstances, like the parents being unable to care for the child. Since the son and DIL are stable and the child isn't even born yet, the grandparents' refusal seems reasonable. \n\nHowever, maybe the son is feeling pressure or financial strain, and the grandparents' refusal could add to that. But the story doesn't mention that. The author's main point is about their own priorities and not wanting to be exploited. It's a boundary setting, which is healthy. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (author not in the wrong) because they have a right to say no and set their expectations. The parents should have discussed their needs with the grandparents earlier, but the grandparents are also not obligated. The author's actions are about respecting their own boundaries and past experiences.\n"
