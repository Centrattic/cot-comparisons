We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The author and their wife are grandparents-to-be. Their son and daughter-in-law are expecting a child, and when the son made a joke about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house, the author and wife set boundaries, saying they won't act as babysitters. The son got upset, thinking they don't want to spend time with their grandkids. The author now is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. The author mentions that raising their son was tough, and they had to put their lives on hold. They wanted to focus on their own goals now. They made it clear they're not babysitters but still want to be part of the grandkids' lives. The son felt blindsided and thought it's normal for grandparents to help with childcare.\n\nFirst, I should consider cultural expectations. In many cultures, grandparents often help with childcare, but it's not a given. The author is setting boundaries, which is their right. However, maybe they could have communicated this earlier and more gently. The son's reaction suggests he had different expectations based on what he saw in other families or media. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that having kids wasn't their wife's dream, and they deserve to enjoy their own lives now. They're not refusing to spend time with the kids entirely but want to avoid being used as free babysitters. The key point is whether it's reasonable to expect grandparents to help with childcare. Some people might argue it's a family responsibility, but others say it's the parents' responsibility first. \n\nThe author's message might have come off as abrupt or hurtful. Maybe they could have explained their stance without making it seem like a refusal to be involved. However, the son's assumption that grandparents automatically provide childcare might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't denying grandparent time but setting limits. \n\nI need to weigh the expectations. The author is within their rights to set boundaries. However, the way they communicated it might have caused unnecessary hurt. The son's reaction is more about unmet expectations rather than the author being wrong. The author isn't the asshole for setting limits; they're just being honest about their needs. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
