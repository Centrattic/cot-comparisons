We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to babysit the grandkids. The author is 47 and their wife is 45. They had their son young, and the wife didn't particularly want kids, which affected their ability to pursue their own goals. Now that their son is married and expecting, they want to focus on their own lives, travel, and hobbies. They told their son they won't act as babysitters but will spend time with the grandkids as a family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their situation. They had their kid young, which might have limited their opportunities. They raised their son, did a lot, and now they're at a point where they want to reclaim their lives. Setting boundaries is important. But the son felt it was a rejection, assuming that all grandparents want to be involved. The author's message is clear: they want to be part of the grandkids' lives but not as primary caregivers or babysitters. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The author isn't refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely. They\u2019re saying they won't be responsible for childcare, which is a valid boundary. The son might have had unspoken expectations, but it's not fair to assume grandparents must provide free childcare. The parents are taking responsibility for their own lives and setting clear expectations. They are not being selfish if they're still engaging but not in a way that sacrifices their own needs. \n\nThe wife's point about not being taken advantage of is valid. They don't have a say in whether their son has kids, so it's reasonable to say their involvement is wanted but not as a duty. The son's reaction might stem from a cultural expectation that grandparents should be available for babysitting, but that's not a universal truth. The author is just clarifying their stance to avoid future misunderstandings. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe they should be more flexible. But they have their own life goals. The key is that they\u2019re not cutting off the grandkids entirely. They\u2019re participating as a family. The author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
