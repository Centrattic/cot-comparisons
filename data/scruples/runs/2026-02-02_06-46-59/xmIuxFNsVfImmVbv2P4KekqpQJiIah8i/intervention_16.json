We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The story is about a parent (the author) who told their son and daughter-in-law that they won't be acting as babysitters for their grandchildren. The author explains that they had their son young, and raising him took a toll on their own lives and aspirations. They wanted to focus on their own goals now, like certifications, travel, etc. The son was upset because he expected grandparents to naturally want to spend time with their grandkids and help out with childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: they raised a child, had their own sacrifices, and now they want to live their life without being expected to take on more childcare responsibilities. They're being clear about their boundaries, which is important. On the other hand, the son felt that grandparents should want to spend time with their grandkids and that the parents are being cold or selfish.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and boundaries. In many cultures, there's an assumption that grandparents will help with childcare, but this isn't a universal expectation. The author is asserting their right to set personal boundaries. However, the way they communicated this might have come off as harsh, especially if the son wasn't expecting such a firm stance.\n\nThe author's wife clarified that they want to spend time with the grandkids as part of the family, not just as babysitters. That seems reasonable because grandparent-grandchild relationships can be meaningful without the grandparents being responsible for childcare. The issue might be the son's assumption that grandparents must take on a specific role, which the parents are now rejecting.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have the right to set their own limits. However, the way they communicated it might have been abrupt, leading to hurt feelings. But the story doesn't indicate that they were rude, just firm. The son's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe he didn't consider his parents' perspective when making his joke about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's. The author's response was to set clear boundaries, which is their right. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own needs, which is valid. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the author's actions don't seem unjustified. So the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
