We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. They provided a story where the author is a parent who told their son and daughter-in-law that they won't be acting as babysitters for their grandchildren. The author and their wife have a history of not having children by choice, and they feel it's their time now to focus on their own lives after raising their son. The son got upset, assuming grandparents should naturally be available for childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms around grandparental responsibilities. In many cultures, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, but that's not a universal expectation. The author is setting boundaries, which is a common practice in modern parenting to avoid burnout and maintain personal autonomy. However, the son might feel that the author is being cold or not supportive, especially since the grandkids haven't even been born yet.\n\nThe key points here are consent and expectations. The author made it clear that they are not taking on the role of babysitters, which is their right. They also mentioned they will be part of the grandkids' lives but with boundaries. The son's reaction might stem from unspoken assumptions about grandparental roles, but the author isn't obligated to meet those expectations if they haven't agreed to them beforehand.\n\nAnother angle is the son's perspective. He might feel that the author is being selfish or not showing love, but the author's stance is about respecting their own life choices and past experiences. The wife's statement about not being \"taken advantage of\" suggests that they want a balanced relationship without being burdened with responsibility they didn't choose.\n\nHowever, communication style matters. The way the author delivered the message could have been more tactful. Instead of a blunt \"don't count on that,\" a more compassionate approach might have helped. But the message itself is about setting boundaries, which isn't inherently wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. They have the right to prioritize their own lives and decide how they want to engage with their grandchildren. The son's expectations might be unrealistic, but the author's response is about self-determination and respecting their own past sacrifices."
