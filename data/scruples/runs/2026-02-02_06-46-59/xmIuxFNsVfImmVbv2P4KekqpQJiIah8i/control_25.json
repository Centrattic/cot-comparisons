We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 47-year-old man whose wife is 45. They had their son when they were very young (he was 16 and she was 18). They mention that their wife regretted having the child and it held them back from achieving personal goals. Despite that, they cared for their son and provided a good upbringing. Now, their son is married, and his wife is pregnant. The son and daughter-in-law (DIL) expect the grandparents to be babysitters for the grandkids. The author and his wife told them that they don't want to be babysitters and want to focus on their own lives. The son was upset, thinking they're being cold. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The grandparents are setting boundaries about not providing childcare. The son is upset because he assumed grandparents would naturally want to help. The grandparents explain that they have their own lives to focus on after raising their son. They clarify they want to spend time with the grandkids but not as primary caregivers or babysitters.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms, many grandparents do help with childcare, but it's not a requirement. The author's point is that they didn't choose to have kids, and now that their son is an adult, they want to live for themselves. They are making it clear that the responsibility of the children is not theirs. The son might feel hurt or betrayed because he expected support, but the grandparents are honest about their limits.\n\nAre they wrong? Well, parents can't force grandparents to do anything. The grandparents have the right to set boundaries. However, the way they communicated it might have been harsh. The son was expecting a certain role, and the grandparents didn't sugarcoat it. But the grandparents are also clear about their intentions to be part of the grandkids' lives without being overburdened. \n\nThe wife's statement about not being taken advantage of and that the kids aren't their responsibility seems reasonable. The son's reaction is based on assumptions, but the grandparents have the right to say no. There's no obligation for grandparents to provide childcare unless there's a prior agreement. The author's perspective is that they have their own lives to live now, which is valid. \n\nHowever, maybe the grandparents could have communicated this more gently. But the core issue is their right to say no. Since the answer is a simple A or B, and the question is about whether they're in the wrong, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They're setting boundaries, which is their right. The son's expectations might be unrealistic, but the grandparents are not obligated to meet them.\n"
