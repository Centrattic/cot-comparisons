We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their future grandkids.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their spouse are in their mid-40s. They had their son when they were teenagers, which they admit had a significant impact on their lives. They worked hard to provide for him and were involved in his upbringing. Now, their son is married and expecting a child. The author is setting boundaries, making it clear that they don't want to be the primary caregivers for their grandchildren, not provide free babysitting, or sacrifice their own plans for their retirement. They want to focus on their own lives, travel, hobbies, etc.\n\nThe son reacts negatively, feeling that it's normal for grandparents to want to be involved and that his parents are being cold. The author is questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking a second opinion. The user wants to know if the answer is A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and family dynamics. In many cultures, grandparents often do help with childcare, but it's not a given. The key here is whether the author's stance is reasonable. The author isn't refusing to have a relationship with their grandkids entirely; they're just not willing to be the primary caretakers or provide unlimited babysitting. They're making it clear that they want to spend time with the grandkids in a family context, not as a substitute for their son and daughter-in-law.\n\nThe parents might have legitimate reasons for setting these boundaries, given their past experiences. They had to put their lives on hold for their son, and now they want to focus on their own goals. It's their choice how they want to spend their time and energy. However, the son might feel entitled to expect grandparental help, which is a common assumption in some families.\n\nBut the author's communication style might be part of the problem. They might have come across as cold or dismissive instead of explaining their feelings more sensitively. However, the actual stance they're taking\u2014setting boundaries\u2014is not inherently wrong. Everyone has the right to set limits on their time and responsibilities, especially for future commitments. The author is not denying their grandchildren love or presence; they're just clarifying the extent of their involvement.\n\nSo, the question is whether setting such boundaries makes the author the asshole. The answer would depend on whether their stance is respectful and reasonable. Since they're not refusing to be part of the grandkids' lives but are simply not taking on the role of caregivers, it's a reasonable boundary. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
