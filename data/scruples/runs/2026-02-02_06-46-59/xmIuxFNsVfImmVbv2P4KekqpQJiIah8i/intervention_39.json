We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law they won't be babysitting the grandkids. The author is 47 and their wife 45, and they had their son when they were 16 and 18. The wife was unhappy about having the child and felt it held them back from their goals. Now their son is having a baby, and the author made it clear they won't be acting as babysitters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is setting boundaries for their future time and responsibilities. They want to focus on their own lives now that their son is grown. On the other hand, the son assumed grandparents would automatically be available for childcare, which is a common expectation in many families. \n\nThe key points are the parents' right to set their own terms versus the son's expectations. The author didn't say they wouldn't spend time with the kids, just that they won't be the primary caregivers or babysitters. The wife emphasized that they want to be part of the kids' lives but not at the expense of their own family time. \n\nThe son reacted negatively, implying that the parents are being cold. But the parents are making it clear that they're not taking over the responsibilities. They\u2019re choosing how they want to engage. It's their choice to prioritize their needs. \n\nSocietally, there's often an expectation for grandparents to help with childcare, but that's not a right. The author is just stating their decision. However, the way they communicated it might have been abrupt. Maybe a more open discussion before the pregnancy could have been better, but the content of their message\u2014setting boundaries\u2014is valid. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They\u2019re making a choice to focus on their own lives post-child-rearing. The answer should be B.\n"
