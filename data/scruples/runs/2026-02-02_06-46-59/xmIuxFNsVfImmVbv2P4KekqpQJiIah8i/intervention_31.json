We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, a father, told his son and daughter-in-law that they shouldn't expect them to act as babysitters for their future grandchildren. The son was upset, thinking that grandparents are supposed to provide childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. The author mentions that they had their son young, which impacted their lives and career opportunities. They had to put their own aspirations on hold. Now that their son is grown and married, they want to focus on their own goals and travel. They're setting boundaries to avoid being used as free childcare. The wife also clarified that they want to spend time with the grandkids as part of the family, not just for babysitting.\n\nOn the other hand, the son felt hurt and assumed that grandparents naturally take on that role. He might feel that his parents are being uncooperative or cold. The son's reaction could be based on cultural expectations or his own upbringing. Maybe he didn't realize that his parents had different needs and boundaries.\n\nI need to evaluate if setting these boundaries is unreasonable. Grandparents often help with childcare, but it's not a legal obligation. The parents have the right to set their own limits, especially if it affects their well-being or life goals. The author isn't refusing to spend time with the grandkids but is clarifying the terms. However, the way they communicated it might have been hurtful. The son's reaction suggests that he had different expectations, which weren't discussed earlier.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the parents could offer some help without being on call 24/7. But the author's stance is clear: they want to focus on their own lives. The key here is whether setting such boundaries is fair. Since they had their son young and sacrificed a lot, it's understandable they want to prioritize their needs now. The son might need to adjust his expectations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're setting healthy boundaries. The son's assumption that grandparents must provide childcare is where the misunderstanding lies. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
