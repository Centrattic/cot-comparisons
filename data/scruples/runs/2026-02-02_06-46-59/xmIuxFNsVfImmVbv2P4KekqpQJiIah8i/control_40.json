We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the grandparents (the author and his wife) told their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for the grandkids. The son got upset, thinking that grandparents naturally want to spend time with their kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the grandparents' perspective. They had their son young and had to put their own lives and plans on hold. They mention that the wife wasn't necessarily looking forward to having kids and that raising their son affected their ability to achieve personal goals. Now that their son is grown and married, they want to focus on their own interests like traveling and getting certifications. They're clear that they want to be part of their grandkids' lives but not take on the responsibility of being caregivers or providing free childcare. That makes sense because they didn't choose to have the grandkids; it's their son and daughter-in-law's choice to have children. The grandparents are setting boundaries, which is something many people do to maintain their own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's reaction is also important. He assumed that grandparents would naturally want to help, which might be a common expectation. However, the grandparents are stating their own needs and limitations. It's possible that the son didn't consider that his parents might have different priorities or that they might not want to be used as free childcare. The key here is communication. The grandparents addressed the issue directly when the comment was made, which is reasonable. They made it clear that they will be involved but not in the way the son expected. \n\nThe wife's statement about not being taken advantage of and that the children aren't their responsibility is also valid. They don't have a say in whether the son and daughter-in-law have children, so it's fair for them to set their own terms for involvement. The son's upset reaction might stem from unmet expectations, but it's the grandparents' right to establish boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the grandparents are asserting their needs and setting limits, which is a healthy approach. They're still willing to spend time with the grandkids but not in a role that compromises their own goals. The son's assumption that grandparents must want to be caregivers might be a cultural or personal expectation, but the grandparents' response is about respecting their own desires. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
