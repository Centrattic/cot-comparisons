We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandchildren.\n\nFirst, the author is 47 and their wife is 45. They had their son when they were 16 and 18. The wife didn't want kids and felt it held them back from their goals. They raised their son, who turned out well, and now they want to focus on their own lives. When the son joked about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the author clarified they won't be babysitters. The son got upset, thinking grandparents should naturally want to spend time with grandkids. The author's wife clarified they want to be part of the grandkids' lives but not be responsible for them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is expectations. The son and daughter-in-law might have assumed that grandparents would naturally help with childcare, but the parents are setting boundaries. The author mentions that having kids wasn't their wife's dream and that they have their own goals now. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, grandparents do help with childcare, but it's not a given. The parents are setting clear boundaries about not taking on the role of primary caregivers for the grandchildren. The author's wife emphasizes that they want to be involved, but not to the point of sacrificing their own lives. \n\nIs it fair for the son to feel that his parents are being cold? The parents are not refusing to spend time with the grandchildren, just not as babysitters. They\u2019re making a distinction between being involved versus being responsible for childcare. The son might not have realized that his parents would have different expectations, especially given their history of not wanting to have kids and now wanting to focus on their own interests.\n\nThe author's wife also points out that the decision to have kids is the son's and daughter-in-law's choice, and the parents shouldn't be expected to sacrifice their own lives for it. That seems reasonable. They're being upfront about their limits, which is important for healthy relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's reaction is about not expecting this. But maybe they should have had this conversation earlier. However, the parents are now addressing it, which is better than making assumptions. The key is mutual understanding and respect. If the son and daughter-in-law feel that their parents are not supportive, but the parents are clear about their boundaries, it's a matter of differing expectations rather than one side being wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They\u2019re setting healthy boundaries and being honest about their intentions. The son's assumption might be based on different cultural or family norms, but the parents have the right to decide how involved they want to be. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
