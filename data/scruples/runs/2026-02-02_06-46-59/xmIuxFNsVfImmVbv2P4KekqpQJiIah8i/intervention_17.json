We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law they won't be babysitters for their grandchildren.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a parent to a grown son who is about to become a father. The author and his wife have made it clear they don't want to be primary caregivers for the grandkids, but still want to be part of their lives. They mention that having kids wasn't their life's dream and that raising their son took away from their own goals. The son was upset, feeling that grandparents should naturally be available for babysitting. \n\nThe key points here are the boundaries the grandparents are setting. They're not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely, just not in a babysitting role. They want to have their own time for travel, hobbies, etc. But the son feels it's expected, which might be a generational or cultural assumption.\n\nI should consider if setting such boundaries is reasonable. Many people do have this expectation, but it's important for grandparents to set their limits. However, the way it was communicated might have been abrupt. The son was confused and then upset, thinking there's something wrong with them. The parents might need to have had this conversation earlier, perhaps more sensitively.\n\nAlso, the parents' history of being involved in their son's life (attending events, helping with college, etc.) might lead the son to expect the same level of involvement with grandchildren. But the parents now want to focus on their own needs. That's a valid choice, but the conflict arises from unmet expectations. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have the right to set boundaries. However, the way they presented it might have been too harsh, not considering their son's feelings. The answer might depend on whether the parents' stance is reasonable and communicated respectfully. In terms of right and wrong, setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they're being honest about their limits, maybe they are not in the wrong. But if the son's expectations are common, maybe the parents should have considered that. Hmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to weigh these factors.\n"
