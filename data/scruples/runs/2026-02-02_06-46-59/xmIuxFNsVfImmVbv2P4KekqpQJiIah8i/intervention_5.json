We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters. The author explains that they didn't plan for grandkids, wanted to focus on their own lives after raising their son, and set boundaries. The son is upset, thinking grandparents should naturally want to spend time as daycare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had their son at a young age and had to put their own goals on hold. They worked hard to support him through college. Now, as they approach their mid-40s, they feel entitled to pursue their own interests. It's reasonable for them to set boundaries, especially if they didn't have prior expectations of grandparental involvement.\n\nBut the son's reaction is also a factor. He might have assumed that being a grandparent means being available for childcare. However, the author made it clear they aren't against spending time with the grandkids, just not as primary caregivers or babysitters. The line between wanting to be involved versus being expected to provide childcare is important.\n\nThe author's wife emphasized that they don't want to be taken advantage of. That's a valid point because adult children shouldn't assume their parents will prioritize their needs. The key is communication. The author set expectations upfront, which is responsible. The son's upset reaction might stem from unmet assumptions, but the authors aren't obligated to meet those expectations if they weren't communicated.\n\nHowever, the way the message was delivered could have been more sensitive. The son felt the authors were being cold, which might be a valid emotional reaction. But the content of the message is about setting boundaries, which is their right. The authors are making a choice about how to balance their own lives and their role as grandparents. There's no inherent wrong in prioritizing their needs as long as they're not rejecting the grandkids entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors are not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries. The conflict arises from differing expectations, not from the authors being unkind. The answer should be B (No).\n"
