We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the grandparents not wanting to be babysitters for their future grandchildren.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents (the author and his wife) had a son when they were young. They had to give up a lot, including their own dreams and plans. Now they're in their 40s and want to focus on their own lives. The son and daughter-in-law are expecting a child, and the grandparents made it clear they won't be acting as babysitters. The son got upset, thinking it's normal for grandparents to help out, but the parents are firm in their decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the grandparents are setting boundaries, the son is upset because he assumed they would help, and the parents are explaining that they have their own lives now. The question is whether the parents are wrong for not being available as babysitters.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, grandparents do help with childcare, but it's not a given. People have different expectations. The parents here made it clear that they want to spend time with their family but not be responsible for childcare. They are not saying they won't see the kids at all, just that they won't act as primary caregivers. \n\nAlso, the parents mention that they didn't choose to have the child; the son and daughter-in-law made that decision. They feel it's unfair to be expected to sacrifice their lives for a choice that wasn't theirs. That seems reasonable. They are protecting their own autonomy and future plans.\n\nThe son's reaction is hurt and confusion. He thought it was a given that grandparents would help. But maybe the parents are justified in setting these boundaries, especially after all they've been through. They worked hard to get to this point where they can focus on themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that being a grandparent is a role that includes helping with childcare. But the parents are clarifying that they will be part of the grandkids' lives but not in a caregiving role. It's about mutual respect and expectations. The parents have the right to prioritize their own needs and not be taken advantage of.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting clear boundaries and explaining their reasoning. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents have the right to say no. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
