We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the parent) is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their future grandchildren. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents had their son when they were very young (16 and 18), and they've raised him to be a successful adult. Now that their son is about to become a father, they want to focus on their own lives, pursuing education, travel, and hobbies. They made it clear they won't act as primary caregivers for the grandkids, but they still want to spend time with them as grandparents.\n\nThe son felt it was normal to expect grandparents to help, and the parents' refusal made him upset. He thought they were being cold. The parents argue that they're not in a position to take on additional responsibilities, and they didn't choose to have kids when they were young, so they shouldn't be expected to sacrifice their current lives for their grandchildren.\n\nNow, considering the situation, boundaries are important. Parents have the right to set limits on how they want to participate in their grandchildren's lives. The parents in this case are not refusing all contact but are setting clear expectations about not being full-time caregivers. They also mention they want to be part of the kids' lives, just not in a role that takes over their own activities.\n\nOn the other hand, the son might have had different expectations, which is common in families. However, the parents are being honest about their limitations. They're not being cruel; they're just stating their needs. It's a matter of differing expectations rather than right or wrong. The parents are within their rights to prioritize their own well-being and future plans, especially after having raised a child under challenging circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They\u2019re setting healthy boundaries, which is a valid choice, even if it causes tension. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents aren't at fault here.\n"
