We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be babysitters for their grandkids. The situation is that the author and their wife had their son when they were young, and they had to put a lot of their personal goals on hold. Now their son and daughter-in-law are expecting a child, and when the son jokingly mentions dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the author and wife clarify that they aren't going to act as primary babysitters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that having kids wasn't their wife's dream, and they felt held back. They love their son but have their own lives now. The son, on the other hand, assumed grandparents would naturally want to baby-sit. The question is whether the author's stance is reasonable.\n\nIn many cultures, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, but that's a choice, not an obligation. The author is setting boundaries, which is their right. They're not refusing all contact but are making it clear they won't be the primary caregivers. The son might feel hurt because he expected support, but the author is prioritizing their own needs and time. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the son is in a position where they need help, and the grandparents are being dismissive. But the author didn't say they wouldn't spend time with the grandkids at all, just not as babysitters. The key is that the author is asserting their autonomy, which is valid. \n\nAlso, the son's reaction seems to imply that being a grandparent automatically means being a babysitter, which isn't necessarily the case. The author's wife made it clear they want to be part of the grandkids' lives but not at the expense of their own. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're setting healthy boundaries and the son's assumption might be unrealistic.\n"
