We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandkids.\n\nFirst, looking at the context: The parents had their son at a young age, which affected their lives and their ability to pursue their own goals. Now that their son is an adult and about to have a child, they want to focus on their own interests like certifications, travel, and hobbies. They made it clear they won't act as full-time babysitters but are open to spending time with the grandkids as part of family time.\n\nThe son reacted negatively, assuming it's normal for grandparents to be available for babysitting. The parents explained their stance, emphasizing that having grandchildren isn't their responsibility and they don't want to sacrifice their own lives again. The son felt hurt and accused them of being cold.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, parents should have the right to set boundaries about their involvement with grandchildren. It's their choice how they want to balance their time and energy. The key here is that the parents aren't refusing to spend time with the kids entirely but are clarifying that it won't be at the expense of their own plans. The son's assumption might stem from cultural norms where grandparents often help with childcare, but the parents' decision to prioritize their own needs is valid.\n\nThe parents aren't being cruel; they're being honest about their limits. The son's reaction suggests he felt blindsided, which might be because the expectation wasn't communicated earlier. However, the parents did explain their reasoning, and they're not closing the door on family time. The daughter-in-law's statement about not being taken advantage of is also a reasonable boundary.\n\nIn conclusion, setting personal boundaries isn't being in the wrong. The parents are advocating for their own well-being and future goals, which is a legitimate stance. So the answer is B.\n"
