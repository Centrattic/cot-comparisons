We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandchildren.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife are 47 and 45, they had a son when they were 16 and 18, so they had to deal with raising a child at a young age. They mention that their son is now a great young man, but the parents have been putting their own lives on hold. Now that their son is married and expecting a child, they want to focus on their own goals, like certifications, travel, hobbies. When the son made a joke about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the author told them not to expect them to be babysitters. The son was upset, thinking that grandparents should naturally want to spend time with their grandkids and not be so cold.\n\nSo the key points here: the parents set clear boundaries about not being available for babysitting, the son feels hurt and thinks they're being selfish, the parents feel they should have control over their time now.\n\nIs setting boundaries about childcare considered being in the wrong? Well, parents have the right to set their own limits. However, the way it was communicated might have been harsh. The parents did mention they would be part of the grandchildren's lives, but not as primary caregivers. But the son felt it was an unexpected rejection. \n\nThe parents might have assumed that their son would understand their perspective, but maybe they should have discussed this before making a blanket statement. Also, considering that the son was making a joke, the parents might have overreacted. However, it's also valid for them to prioritize their own needs, especially after having put so much into raising their son.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are asserting their own needs, which is not inherently wrong. However, the way they presented it might have been a shock to their son, especially since he assumed that being grandparents meant automatic involvement. There's a cultural expectation sometimes that grandparents are expected to provide childcare, but that's not always the case. The parents are making their stance clear, so they aren't in the wrong for stating their boundaries. So answer B.\n"
