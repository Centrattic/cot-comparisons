We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent in their late 40s, having had their son when they were teenagers. They mention that their wife really didn't want kids and felt like having their son held them back from their own goals. Now, their son is going to have a baby, and the parents are setting boundaries by saying they won't be babysitters for the grandkids. The son is upset because he thought grandparents would automatically want to help with childcare. The parents explain that they want to focus on their own lives now, not take care of the grandkids, and that they're not responsible for raising them. The son feels hurt and thinks there's something wrong with his parents for not being eager to help.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' perspective. They had a tough time with their own upbringing, the mother didn't want kids, and they had to sacrifice a lot for their son. Now that he's grown, they want to focus on their own interests and not be expected to be caregivers again. It's their right to set boundaries, especially if they feel they were taken advantage of before. The parents are clear that they still want to spend time with the grandkids but not in a babysitting role. They're not cutting off the grandkids entirely but are setting clear limits.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's reaction is about assumptions. Many people do expect grandparents to help with childcare, so maybe he didn't realize his parents weren't going to be part of the childcare routine. His hurt feelings come from the expectation that being a grandparent automatically includes hands-on help. But the parents are making it clear that this isn't the case. The parents aren't refusing to be involved entirely, just not in the way the son expected.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The parents communicated their stance after the fact, which might have come as a shock to the son. But they have the right to set boundaries about their time and energy. The parents are not being cruel; they're just stating their own needs. The son's assumption is common but perhaps not universal. The parents' response is about self-preservation and prioritizing their own lives after years of raising a child.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, grandparent involvement in childcare is the norm, but in others, it's less expected. The parents here are asserting their choice, which is valid even if it upsets their son. They\u2019re not doing anything harmful; they\u2019re just not fulfilling an expectation the son had.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to set these boundaries based on their past experiences and their current desires. The son's reaction is about unmet expectations, but the parents are not obligated to meet those expectations. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
