We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their son and daughter-in-law that they won't be acting as babysitters for their grandkids. The author explains that they raised their son, now have their own goals and plans, and don't want to sacrifice their time again. The son was upset, thinking grandparents should naturally want to be involved and help. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's side: they have their own lives they want to focus on after raising their son. They mention that having kids wasn't their wife's dream and that they had to put their own ambitions on hold. They want to take their time for themselves, not be on call as babysitters. They clarify they want to be part of the grandkids' lives but not responsible for childcare.\n\nThe son's side: He assumed grandparents would want to be involved and help out. He's upset because he feels the author is being cold and not embracing the role of grandparents. He might feel that being a grandparent includes helping with childcare, maybe even expecting it as a norm.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? It depends on cultural expectations and family dynamics. In many cultures, grandparents do help with childcare, but it's not a given. The author is setting boundaries, which is their right. They're not refusing all interaction but are clear they won't be primary caregivers. The son's assumption that grandparents should automatically be babysitters could be the issue here. The author's response is about setting limits, not being unkind. They're making their expectations clear to avoid future resentment. The son's reaction might be due to unspoken expectations. The author isn't wrong for wanting to prioritize their own lives after raising a child. They're being honest, which is better than pretending to be available and then resenting it later. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
