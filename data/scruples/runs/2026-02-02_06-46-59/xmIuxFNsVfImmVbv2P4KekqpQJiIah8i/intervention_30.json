We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent (the author and his wife) told their son and daughter-in-law that they won't be acting as babysitters for their grandkids. The son is upset because he thought grandparents naturally want to spend time with their grandkids, but the parents are setting boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parents had a lot of sacrifices when raising their son. The mom even mentioned she wished she had an abortion, which is a heavy point. They're now in their 40s, and they want to focus on their own lives, like travel and hobbies. They're not saying they won't have any contact, but they're making it clear they won't be the default babysitters. \n\nOn the other hand, the son is getting married and expecting a child, and he assumed that being a grandparent would mean they'd be available for childcare. His reaction seems to be shock and hurt feelings. Maybe he didn't communicate his expectations, or he has a different cultural or family norm where grandparents are expected to help more.\n\nThe key here is whether setting boundaries is reasonable. The parents are making it clear that they won't be sacrificing their own life for their grandchildren. They're offering to be part of the grandkids' lives but not as primary caregivers. That seems fair. People have different lifestyles and priorities. It's possible that the son wasn't considering his parents' perspective and their past experiences. \n\nBut maybe the way they communicated it was abrupt, leading to the son's upset reaction. However, the parents were clear and upfront before the grandchild was even born, which gives the son time to adjust and plan accordingly. The parents aren't refusing all contact, just setting limits. So in that case, they aren't in the wrong. The son might need to adjust his expectations and find other support systems. \n\nAnother angle is that the parents are being honest about their limitations. They have the right to say no to responsibilities they didn't agree to. The son might feel hurt, but the parents aren't obligated to fulfill his expectations. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
