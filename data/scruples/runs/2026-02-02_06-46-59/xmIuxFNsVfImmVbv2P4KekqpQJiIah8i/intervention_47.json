We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law they won't be babysitting for their grandkids. The situation is pretty detailed, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe author and their wife had their son young and had to put their own lives on hold. They mention that raising their son was a struggle, and their wife had regrets about not having an abortion. Now that their son is grown and about to have a child, they want to focus on their own goals like travel and education. They set clear boundaries with their son, explaining they won't be babysitters but still want to be involved in a different way.\n\nOn the other hand, the son felt hurt and assumed that grandparents typically take on a bigger role in childcare. He might not have realized his parents had different expectations. The author's son reacted emotionally, thinking there's something wrong with his parents for not wanting to be primary caregivers for his kids.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In some families, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, but it's not a universal expectation. The parents have a right to their own lives and can set boundaries. However, the way the author communicated this might have been perceived as harsh or cold, especially if the son had different assumptions.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to prioritize their own needs vs. the son's expectations. The parents clearly state they want to be involved but not as primary caregivers. The son's reaction suggests a lack of understanding of his parents' perspective. The author's intentions were to set boundaries, not to be dismissive of the grandkids. However, the way it was delivered might have been abrupt, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about respecting each other's choices. The parents are making a choice for their own lifestyle, which is valid. The son is also entitled to his feelings. The answer might depend on whether the author's statement was communicated with respect and understanding. The wife's part about not being taken advantage of seems reasonable. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But I should check if there's any aspect where they overstepped. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're setting boundaries, but some might argue they should be more considerate of their son's expectations. However, it's their choice to make. So, leaning towards B.\n"
