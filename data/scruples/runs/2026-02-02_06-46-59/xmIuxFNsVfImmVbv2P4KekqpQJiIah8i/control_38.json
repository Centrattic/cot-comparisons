We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author, a parent, is saying they don't want to be babysitters for their future grandkids. Their son and daughter-in-law were expecting them to help out with childcare, but the parents decided to set boundaries.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' perspective. They had their son young, which made them miss out on a lot of opportunities. The mom didn't want the child initially, and they've already put their lives on hold for their son. Now they want to focus on their own goals like travel and hobbies. It sounds like they're trying to reclaim their time and not be taken advantage of. They're not saying they won't spend time with the kids, just that they won't be the ones constantly babysitting or taking responsibility for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the son is upset because he assumed grandparents would want to help. There's a cultural expectation sometimes that grandparents should be available for childcare. The son might not have considered that his parents have their own needs and limitations. The parents-in-law (DIL) might also have expectations based on her family's norms.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation for grandparents to babysit. Emotionally, it's more complex. The parents are setting boundaries, which is their right. They're not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely, just clarifying that childcare isn't their responsibility. The son's reaction of thinking there's something wrong with them seems harsh. The parents have the right to prioritize their own lives, especially after raising a child already.\n\nBut maybe the son felt blindsided. Maybe they didn't talk about it beforehand. However, the parents are now articulating their needs, which is a responsible approach. They're trying to prevent future resentment. The answer here would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're setting healthy boundaries and it's their choice how to allocate their time. The son's assumption might be the issue, not the parents' response.\n"
