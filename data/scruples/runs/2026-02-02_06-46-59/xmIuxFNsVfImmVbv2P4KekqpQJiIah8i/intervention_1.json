We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about grandparents not wanting to be babysitters for their grandchildren.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their wife are grandparents expecting a grandchild. They had their son when they were young, and the mother felt she missed out on her own dreams. Now, they want to focus on their own lives and are explicitly stating that they won't be acting as babysitters. The son got upset, thinking it's normal for grandparents to help with childcare. The author is asking if they're the asshole for this stance.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nLet me break it down. The key points are: the grandparents want to prioritize their own lives after raising their son. They made it clear they won't provide childcare unless it's family time. The son was hurt and felt it's normal for grandparents to help. The author's wife emphasized that the grandchildren aren't their responsibility and they don't want to be taken advantage of.\n\nIs it reasonable for grandparents to set boundaries? Well, people have different expectations. Some grandparents enjoy helping, others don't. The author's point is about not feeling obligated to sacrifice their time. The son's assumption is that all grandparents want to take care of the kids, but that's not a universal truth. The grandparents are setting clear boundaries, which is their right. However, the way they communicated it might have been abrupt, causing hurt feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they're honest about their wishes without being hostile, maybe they're not. They did express willingness to spend time with the grandkids, but on their terms. The son might need to adjust his expectations. The author's wife even apologized for not meeting expectations. \n\nOn the flip side, the son might be entitled to expect some support from his parents. But the author argues that having children is a choice, and the parents shouldn't have to adjust their lives again. \n\nI think it's about setting boundaries. It's not inherently wrong to prioritize your own needs. The author is being upfront, even if it's a sensitive topic. The son's reaction is emotional, but the grandparents have the right to decide how involved they want to be. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance. Did they have a tactful way of saying it? The example shows they did explain their reasoning. The key is that they're not refusing to be part of the kids' lives, just not as babysitters. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
