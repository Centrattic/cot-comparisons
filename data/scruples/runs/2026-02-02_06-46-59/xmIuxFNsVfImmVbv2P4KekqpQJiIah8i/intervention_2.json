We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who had their son at a young age (the dad was 16, the mom 18), and they raised him. The mom wasn't thrilled about having kids and it's clear that raising their son impacted their lives and their ability to achieve other goals. Now their son is getting married and expecting a child. The parents had thought that their job was done and that they could focus on their own lives now. When the son made a joke about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the parents clarified that they won't be acting as babysitters. The son was upset, feeling that grandparents should naturally want to spend time with their grandkids. The parents explained they want to be part of their lives but not take on the responsibility of raising them or providing free childcare. The son feels hurt and thinks there's something wrong with the parents.\n\nSo the question is: Are the parents in the wrong for setting these boundaries?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They had a tough time raising their own son, which affected their lives. They might feel that they've done their part and now want to enjoy their own lives. They\u2019re not refusing to have a relationship with the grandchild, just setting boundaries against being used as babysitters. They\u2019re not taking responsibility for raising the next generation. That seems reasonable in terms of personal boundaries. People have the right to set limits on their time and responsibilities, especially after having already raised their own children.\n\nOn the other hand, the son might have had different expectations based on cultural norms or his own experiences. He might have assumed that being a grandparent automatically includes providing childcare. But the parents are making it clear that they\u2019re not there to be on call. It's important to note that the parents are still willing to be involved, just not in a way that's disruptive to their lives. The key here is communication. The parents could have approached this more sensitively, perhaps earlier, to avoid hurt feelings. However, the expectations about grandparental involvement can vary widely. The parents are asserting their autonomy, which is their right.\n\nAnother angle: The parents are not refusing to have a relationship, just clarifying the extent of their involvement. The son might feel rejected, but the parents have the right to decide how they want to be involved. The parents also mention that the mother didn't want kids and it held them back. That context might make their stance more understandable. They\u2019re not being cruel; they\u2019re protecting their own needs.\n\nHowever, some might argue that grandparents often play a role in childcare, and setting such strict boundaries could be seen as selfish. But I think it's more about differing expectations. The parents are being honest about their limits. The son's assumption that all grandparents want to be babysitters might not hold true for everyone. The parents are making their position clear before the grandchild is even born, which is proactive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents could have handled the conversation with more tact, their stance isn't inherently wrong. They have the right to prioritize their own lives and set boundaries. So the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
