We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is wrong for not wanting to be babysitters for their grandkids. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the parents (the author and his wife) had their son young and had to put their own goals on hold. They mention that raising their son was tough, especially since the wife didn't want kids and it held them back. Now they're in their late 40s and want to focus on their own lives, pursuing things they missed out on. \n\nThe son, who they raised well, is getting a kid, and he assumed his parents would be the go-to babysitters. The parents then clearly state they won't be doing that, explaining they want to spend time with the family as a whole, not just the grandkids. The son and his wife got upset, thinking it's normal for grandparents to help with childcare. \n\nSo the question is: Are the parents wrong for setting these boundaries? \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, grandparents do help with childcare. However, it's also a personal choice. The parents here aren't refusing to be involved entirely, just not as primary caregivers. They\u2019re making it clear that their time is for their own lives and family activities, not as free labor. \n\nThe parents have a valid point about not being responsible for their son's and daughter-in-law's choices. They\u2019re setting expectations early, which is good for avoiding future resentment. The son\u2019s reaction seems to stem from an assumption that grandparents must help, but the parents are asserting their right to prioritize themselves. \n\nIt's possible that the son and daughter-in-law might feel unprepared for the challenges of parenthood, but the parents aren't obligated to support their childcare unless they choose to. The key here is that the parents are not cutting off grandparent-grandchild interactions but are setting clear boundaries. \n\nI think the parents are justified in their stance. They\u2019ve communicated their intentions upfront, which is responsible. The son's assumption might be based on common expectations, but the parents are within their rights to decide how they want to be involved. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
