We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their future grandchildren.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author and their wife had a son when they were young, which impacted their ability to pursue their own goals. Now, they feel they've done their duty and want to focus on their own lives. They made it clear they won't be acting as free babysitters, which upset their son.\n\nThe son's reaction is based on the assumption that grandparents should naturally want to spend time with their grandkids and be available for childcare. He feels his parents are being cold. The author's side is about setting boundaries and protecting their own interests after raising their son.\n\nI need to consider cultural expectations here. In many cultures, grandparents are expected to help with childcare. However, the author is asserting their right to set personal boundaries. The key points are whether the author's stance is reasonable or if they're being inconsiderate.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to have a relationship with their grandchildren; they're just not offering free childcare. They clarified they will be part of the grandkids' lives but don't want to be responsible for babysitting. This seems like a reasonable boundary. The son's assumption that this is the default might be the issue here.\n\nAlso, the author's wife had expressed regret about having the child and the impact on their lives. So, their stance isn't just about personal preference but also about past experiences. They're trying to avoid repeating what they see as sacrifices made for their son.\n\nHowever, the son might feel disrespected or that his needs as a new parent aren't considered. But the author isn't saying they won't be involved; they're just not making childcare a priority. It's about balancing their own needs with family obligations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is setting boundaries, which is their right. They are not in the wrong for doing so. The answer should be B.\n"
