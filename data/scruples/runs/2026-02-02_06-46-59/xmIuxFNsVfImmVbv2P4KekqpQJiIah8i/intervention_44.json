We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about grandparents setting boundaries with their son and daughter-in-law regarding not acting as babysitters for their future grandchildren. The son feels hurt and assumes it's normal for grandparents to help. The author's argument is that they want to focus on their own lives now that their son is grown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents had their son young and had to put their own plans on hold. They worked hard to support him and his education. Now they want to pursue their own interests and not take on the role of unpaid childcare. They made it clear this is their decision, not to be taken advantage of.\n\nThe son's reaction is that he assumed all grandparents would want to spend time with their grandkids, implying that the parents are being cold. But the parents are clarifying that while they will be involved, they won't be responsible for childcare. It's a boundary setting. \n\nThe key here is whether setting such boundaries is unreasonable. From the parents' perspective, they are reclaiming their lives after years of responsibility. They are not refusing to have a relationship but are setting limits on what they can offer. The son's assumption that grandparents must be available for babysitting might stem from cultural norms or expectations, but those can vary. \n\nHowever, the parents have the right to decide how they want to engage with their grandchildren. The son's hurt feelings might be valid, but the parents are not obligated to meet his expectations if they've communicated their limits. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're being clear and setting healthy boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents could have approached the conversation more gently, but the content of their message is justified. They should be allowed to prioritize their own needs without guilt. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are establishing boundaries, not being cold. The son's expectations were perhaps unrealistic, and the parents have the right to define their role.\n"
