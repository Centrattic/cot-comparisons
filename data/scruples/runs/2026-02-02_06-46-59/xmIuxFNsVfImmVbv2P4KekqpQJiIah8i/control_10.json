We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and their wife deciding not to be babysitters for their future grandchildren. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they had their son when they were 16 and 18. They had to put their own lives on hold, and the wife never really wanted kids. Now, their son is married and expecting, and they made it clear they won't be acting as primary caregivers. The son and daughter-in-law were under the impression that grandparents would automatically help with babysitting, but the parents are setting boundaries.\n\nHmm. Grandparents have no legal obligation to help with their grandchildren. The parents are setting clear expectations early on, which could prevent future conflicts. The son is upset because he assumed they would help, but the parents are asserting their right to focus on their own lives now. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural expectation here. In some families, it's traditional for grandparents to help with childcare. However, the parents are explaining that they have their own goals now and don't want to be in a caregiving role again. It's their choice how they spend their time, even if it disappoints their son. \n\nThe key points are that the parents are being upfront and honest. They love their son and will be part of their grandkids' lives, but not as primary caregivers. The son's assumption that this is a given might be the issue. The parents aren't refusing to spend time, just setting boundaries around how. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to prioritize their own needs and set these boundaries. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents are clear and respectful in their communication.\n"
