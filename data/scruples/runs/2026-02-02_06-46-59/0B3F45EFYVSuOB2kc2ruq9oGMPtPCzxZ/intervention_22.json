She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with different religious beliefs and disagreements over raising their son. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, possibly under her family's influence. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to raise their son as Muslim against his wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement that their kids would be raised secular. The wife agreed to that. However, after the birth of their son, the wife's family is pressuring her to take the child to the mosque, and it's revealed that the father-in-law took the son without the husband's knowledge. The husband feels that his parental rights are being violated and is prepared to divorce his wife if she continues this. The wife, on the other hand, might be caught between her family's expectations and her own relationship with her husband.\n\nNow, the user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The user himself thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe husband's argument is that he and his wife had an agreement about the children's upbringing. The wife agreed to that, but her family is exerting pressure on her, and she's allowing her father to interact with the child in a way that goes against their agreement. The husband feels that this is a breach of their previous understanding and is taking a firm stance by threatening divorce. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel pressured by her family, especially since her father is a fundamentalist Muslim. She might be struggling with her own beliefs and cultural expectations. The fact that her family didn't attend the wedding and have issues with the husband's background (being white and Christian) could add to the tension. The husband's father-in-law taking the child to the mosque without consent is a direct violation of their agreement, which the husband is justified in being upset about.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong for threatening divorce? Well, the couple had an agreement, and the wife agreed to the secular upbringing. The husband is standing by that agreement. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of that agreement, but the wife is still involved in facilitating some of this. The husband is taking action to protect his child's upbringing according to their original agreement. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme. Divorce is a major step, and while the husband has a right to enforce the agreement, using divorce as a threat might not be necessary if there are other ways to resolve the conflict. The wife's autonomy as an adult is also a factor here; the husband can't control her every action, but he has shared parental responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's approach of flat-out threatening divorce might not address the underlying issues. It could push the wife into a corner, making her feel like she has to choose between her family and her husband. The wife might need support in navigating her family's pressures rather than facing a ultimatum. The husband could consider mediation or legal steps to establish custody arrangements that prevent her father from influencing the child without consent. \n\nHowever, from the husband's perspective, his stance is about protecting his son from what he sees as inappropriate religious indoctrination. If the wife is complicit in allowing her father to take the child against their agreement, then the husband has a legitimate concern. The key issue is whether the wife is respecting the original agreement. If she is not, then the husband's position is defendable. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is threatening divorce solely because the wife is not adhering to their agreement, and given that the wife might be under family pressure, it's possible that the husband is overreacting. Divorce is a drastic measure for a disagreement over child-rearing, especially if there's potential for negotiation. However, if the wife is actively undermining their agreement by allowing her father to take the child, then the husband is within his rights to express his boundaries. \n\nIn terms of legality, in many jurisdictions, both parents have equal say in the child's upbringing unless a custody arrangement is made. If the husband is the legal parent, he has the right to object to the child being exposed to another religion without mutual consent. However, the wife's actions in allowing her father to take the child might be a breach of that agreement. \n\nSo, considering all this, the husband's position is understandable given the circumstances. He is trying to uphold the agreement they had. However, threatening divorce over this might be a harsh response. The answer hinges on whether the husband is justified in taking such a firm stance. If the wife is not honoring the agreement, the husband is not in the wrong for standing his ground. However, the method of resolving it through divorce may be excessive unless there are no other options. The wife's autonomy and the husband's parental rights are both important factors here. \n\nGiven that the husband is trying to protect his son's upbringing according to their prior agreement and the wife is allowing her father to interfere against their agreement, the husband's stance is defensible. Therefore, the answer would be that the husband is not in the wrong.\n"
