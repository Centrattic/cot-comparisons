She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a husband who is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. The wife's family is against the husband because he's white from a Christian background. The wife was initially agnostic but now her family is pressuring her to raise the child as Muslim. The father found out the father-in-law took the son to the mosque and dressed him in Muslim clothes without consent. The author threatens divorce if the wife continues this.\n\nI should consider the key points here. The parents' agreement on secular upbringing. The father-in-law's actions against the husband's wishes. The wife's possible compliance or resistance. The husband's response of threatening divorce.\n\nPossible angles: The husband's right to co-parenting, the wife's autonomy, the father-in-law's overstepping, the impact on the child. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising the child unless there's a court order. The husband might feel his parental rights are violated. The wife's family's actions could be seen as interference. However, the wife is an adult and might have her own views, but the husband feels she's not protecting his wishes.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for threatening divorce? If the wife is not acting against his wishes but her family is, maybe the conflict is with her family, not her. But the husband is upset because the wife is allowing her father to do this. The wife might be under pressure, leading to her depression. The husband's response is extreme, but the father-in-law's actions are problematic. The husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a personal choice. If they had an agreement and the wife is not following through (maybe she's being pressured), the husband's frustration is understandable. However, threatening divorce over this is a drastic step. But if the wife's actions are violating their agreement, then the husband's position might be justified. The father-in-law's actions are a key issue here. The husband is trying to prevent religious indoctrination against his wishes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on cultural context, but in terms of legal and parental rights, the husband might not be in the wrong. However, threatening divorce is a strong move. The wife's situation is also complicated, being caught between her family and her husband. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his parenting rights.\n"
