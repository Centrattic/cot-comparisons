She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs, specifically about raising their son. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. Now, the wife's family is pressuring her to raise the son as Muslim. The father-in-law even took the baby to the mosque without consent. The husband is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, both parents have equal rights in raising the child. The husband is the legal father, so he has a say. The father-in-law's actions without permission might be a concern, but the wife's role is key here. She agreed to secular upbringing, yet her family is influencing the child. The husband's frustration is about control over his child's upbringing.\n\nEthically, the husband is standing by his original agreement. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her marriage. The father-in-law's behavior is problematic, using the child against the husband. The husband's threat of divorce is extreme but perhaps a last resort after repeated issues. It's a clash of values and boundaries. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his child's upbringing, but maybe the approach could be better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asserting his parental rights and there's a prior agreement, the answer might lean towards B (No). But need to check if there's any fault here, like not handling it through legal means first. But since it's a new situation, maybe he's justified. Also, the father-in-law's actions without consent are a breach of parental rights. So the husband isn't wrong. Answer B.\n"
