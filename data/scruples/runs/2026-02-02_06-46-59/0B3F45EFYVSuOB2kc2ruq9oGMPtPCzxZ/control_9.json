She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a man who married a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. He's an atheist, and when they met, she was too, maybe agnostic. They agreed that their kids would be raised secular, with the option to choose later. Now they have a son, but the wife's father has taken the baby to the mosque without permission. The author is upset and even said he'll divorce her if this continues.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement about their child's upbringing. The father is against any religious drilling into their son, while the mother's family, especially the father, is pressuring to raise the child Muslim. The mother isn't happy with her family's influence, but she's allowing her father to take the baby without the father's knowledge.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he's being excluded from decisions about his child's upbringing. He sees the father-in-law's actions as overstepping, especially since he's not Muslim. The mother might be caught between her family's expectations and her own agreement with her husband. The father feels his boundaries are being violated by the mother's family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The couple had an agreement, so if the mother is going against that agreement by allowing her father to influence the child, then she's the one breaking the agreement. But the author is using the threat of divorce as a response. Is that justified?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, both parents have equal rights in raising their child. However, since the mother's family is exerting pressure without the father's consent, there might be a conflict in parental rights. The author's stance is about protecting his child from religious indoctrination, which he has a right to, especially since the child is young. But the mother's family's actions might also be seen as violating the father's rights.\n\nHowever, the threat of divorce over this issue is a serious matter. Divorce should ideally be a last resort, and the author is using it as a consequence for ongoing actions he disapproves of. The question is whether his actions (threatening divorce) are justified given the circumstances. \n\nThe mother might feel pressured by her family and possibly conflicted between her husband's wishes and her own family's expectations. The author's response could be seen as extreme if the mother is not directly violating the agreement but is perhaps being influenced or coerced by her family. However, if the mother is complicit in allowing her father to take the child without consent, she is partly responsible.\n\nIt's also important to consider cultural and familial dynamics. The mother's family might have strong cultural expectations, but the father is asserting his right to raise the child according to secular values. The mother's happiness in their home versus her family's pressure could be a factor in her decisions. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is trying to protect his child from unwanted religious influence, which he has a right to, given that he is the father. However, using divorce as a threat might be seen as harsh, especially if the mother is dealing with her own family's pressures. The question is whether the author's response is proportionate to the issue.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting style. On the other hand, threatening divorce over this might be seen as not allowing the mother to navigate her own cultural tensions. The mother might need support rather than ultimatums. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not in the wrong because he is protecting his child's upbringing as agreed. However, the method of using divorce as a threat might be problematic. But given the context that the mother's family is violating the father's wishes without consent, the author's stance is understandable. The mother's actions in allowing her father to take the child against the father's knowledge might be the main issue. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he is asserting his parental rights and the couple's agreement. However, it's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points. The author's approach is firm, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable response to protect his child's upbringing.\n"
