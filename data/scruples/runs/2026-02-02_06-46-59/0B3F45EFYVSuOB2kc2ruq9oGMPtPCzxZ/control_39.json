She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the letter is at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed that their children would be raised secular. The wife's family doesn't like the author because he's white and from a Christian background. Now, the author found out that his father-in-law took their son to the mosque and dressed him in Muslim clothes without permission. The author threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nSo, the key points here are about parental rights, religious upbringing, and the wife's autonomy. The author is concerned about his son being raised in a religion he doesn't agree with. The wife, on the other hand, might feel torn between her family and her husband. The in-laws are exerting pressure, which complicates things.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. However, he's threatening divorce over this, which is a serious measure. The wife agreed to secular upbringing, but maybe she's now conflicted? Or perhaps she's compliant with her family's wishes against her husband's. The author's father-in-law's actions are problematic because they went against the parents' agreement.\n\nBut is the author right to use divorce as a threat? Divorce is a major decision. Maybe he should explore other avenues first, like counseling or legal measures to protect the child's upbringing. However, the father-in-law's actions are a breach of trust and could affect the child's religious environment. The author is standing by his original agreement, which the wife had agreed to. If the wife is not upholding her part, perhaps the author is justified in his stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might have her own reasons for allowing the in-laws' influence, maybe feeling pressured by her family or not wanting to alienate them. The author might be dismissing her autonomy as an adult, as he mentions she can do what she wants. But when it comes to their child, he's taking a firm stand. There's a balance between respecting the wife's background and protecting the child's upbringing.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights to their child's upbringing. If the author is the sole decision-maker, that might not hold. But if the wife is allowing her family to influence the child without the husband's consent, that could be an issue. The threat of divorce seems extreme, but it's based on his concerns about the child's future.\n\nIn terms of morality, is he wrong to prioritize his beliefs over his wife's? The wife might feel caught in the middle. The author might be overstepping by threatening divorce, but he's also trying to protect his child's future. It's a complex situation with no clear right or wrong. However, threatening divorce over this could strain the marriage further. Maybe there's a middle ground.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he's standing by his agreement and trying to protect his child's upbringing. However, his approach is harsh. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his parental rights, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
