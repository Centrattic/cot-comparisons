She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author is in a two-year marriage with his wife, who comes from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. He's an atheist, and when they first met, his wife was agnostic but would put on a front for her father. Her family doesn't like him because he's white and from a Christian background, and they didn't attend the wedding. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, with the possibility of the kids choosing Islam later on. Now that their son is born, the wife's family is pressuring to see the child and take him to the mosque. The author initially refused, and the wife agreed, but he found out that her father took the son to the mosque and dressed him in Muslim clothes without his knowledge. \n\nThe author is upset because he feels his father-in-law is exerting control over his wife and their son. He mentions that when the wife is with her father, she comes back depressed and ashamed. He's firm in his stance that the son shouldn't be raised with Islam, even to the point of threatening divorce. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the agreement they had before having children. If both parties agreed to secular upbringing, then one going back on that agreement might be a problem. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her prior agreement with her husband. The father-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if he's interacting with the child without the husband's consent. \n\nBut why did the wife allow her father to take the baby? If they had an agreement, maybe she's trying to maintain family ties while still being with her husband. The author is now threatening divorce, which is a serious consequence. Is it fair to use a divorce threat over a disagreement on religious upbringing? \n\nIn many cultures, family and religious practices are significant. The wife's family might be trying to connect with their grandson, but the husband feels it's against his values. The key here is communication. Did the husband clearly express his stance before the child was born? The wife agreed to the secular upbringing, so maybe she didn't expect her father to push so hard. \n\nHowever, the husband is now saying he can't allow the son to be raised that way, even if it means splitting up. Threatening divorce over this could strain the relationship and possibly affect the child's well-being. But the wife is an adult and should have the autonomy to make decisions for her child and herself. The husband is using the child as a reason to maintain the secular upbringing, which is his right, but he's also giving his wife an ultimatum. \n\nOn the other hand, the father-in-law's actions are problematic. Taking the child without consent and imposing religious practices might be illegal in some jurisdictions, depending on child custody laws. The husband has a right to be involved in major decisions about his child. \n\nBut the wife's actions are the crux here. If she's violating the agreement by allowing her father to influence the child, the husband has a right to be upset. However, threatening divorce immediately might be too extreme. The wife might need support to navigate her family's pressure without cutting them off entirely. \n\nThe husband's position is that he doesn't want the religion to be \"drilled into\" the child, which is a personal belief. The wife might feel that her family's involvement is important, even if it's religious. There's a lack of understanding or compromise shown. The husband is being authoritarian in his approach, not giving the wife a chance to explain her actions or find a middle ground. \n\nIn terms of legal rights, in most places, both parents have equal say in their child's upbringing unless one has sole legal custody. So, if the wife is making decisions without considering her husband's views, that might be an issue. But the husband's response of divorce could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe wife's emotional state is also a factor. She seems to be struggling between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. The husband should address the issue with her, not through threats. Maybe there's room for dialogue to understand why she's allowing her father to influence their child and to find a solution that respects both their values. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong if he's using an ultimatum without considering the wife's perspective and the broader family dynamics. However, if his wife is going against the prior agreement, that's also a problem. The situation is complex, but the immediate threat of divorce might not be justified without trying to resolve the issue first.\n"
