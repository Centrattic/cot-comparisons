She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over the religious upbringing of their son.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is an atheist, his wife was previously agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards being Muslim. They had agreed their kids would be raised secular. The author's in-laws are fundamentalist Muslims and don't like him because he's white. The wife's father took their son to the mosque without the author's consent, which he finds unacceptable. The author feels that his son shouldn't be exposed to religious teachings against his wishes, even if it means divorcing his wife.\n\nSo, the main points here are the parents' agreement about secular upbringing, the author's objection to religious influence from the in-laws, and the threat of divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many countries, both parents have equal rights in their child's upbringing unless a court decides otherwise. However, if there's a prior agreement, that might not hold much weight legally. The father is asserting his right to prevent religious indoctrination, which could be seen as a valid concern, especially since the mother's family is imposing this without consent.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The author is standing up for his beliefs and protecting his child from what he sees as unwanted religious influence. However, threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, especially since the wife might have her own beliefs and rights. The problem is whether the author is overstepping by using divorce as a ultimatum. On the other hand, if the wife isn't opposing her father's actions, maybe she's not upholding the initial agreement they had.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's autonomy. She's an adult, so she can make her own choices. But when it comes to the child, both parents should ideally work together. If the wife is complicit in allowing her father to influence the child, the author might feel justified in taking a firm stand.\n\nThere's also the issue of the father-in-law's actions. Taking the child without consent is a problem, and the author is trying to stop that. However, should the threat of divorce be directed at the wife for not stopping her father? It's possible the wife is under pressure from her family, which complicates things. The author might be right to be concerned, but the method of resolving it by threatening divorce could be seen as harsh.\n\nIn some cultures, religious upbringing is very important, and the author's stance might be seen as dismissive of his wife's heritage. However, he's also protecting his child's upbringing according to his own secular views. It's a conflict between two parents' values.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is in the wrong for taking such a hard line. If the wife is not protecting the child from her family's influence, the author might feel he has no choice but to act. However, threatening divorce could be seen as an extreme measure, especially if there's a chance for compromise or legal intervention. But given the situation, maybe he's justified in standing his ground to protect his child's upbringing. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the threat of divorce is a big step. But considering the circumstances, maybe it's understandable.\n"
