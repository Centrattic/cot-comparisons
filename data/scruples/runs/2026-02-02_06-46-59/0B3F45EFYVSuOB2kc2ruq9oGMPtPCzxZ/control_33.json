She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a conflict between a father and his wife regarding their son's religious upbringing.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and they had agreed before having kids that their children would be raised secularly. The wife initially seemed to agree, but now her family is pressuring her and even taking their son to the mosque without the father's consent. The father feels that his wife is going against their agreement and that his father-in-law is overstepping by influencing their child.\n\nSo, the author is threatening divorce if his wife continues to raise their son as Muslim. The key points here are the initial agreement, the breach of that agreement, and the father's right to have a say in his child's upbringing. \n\nLegally, both parents have equal rights in raising their child unless there's a court order. However, since they are married, they might have a mutual agreement. The wife's actions could be seen as violating that agreement. The author is standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing as per their prior agreement. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the wife's autonomy. She's an adult and might have her own reasons for wanting to include her religion. However, the father-in-law's involvement without consent could be problematic, especially since it's against the parents' initial agreement. The father's role in protecting his son from unwanted religious influence might be justified from his perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach of threatening divorce might be seen as extreme. Communication issues might be at play here. Instead of an ultimatum, working through the conflict with counseling could be a better approach. However, given the firm stance on the child's upbringing, which is a fundamental issue for the author, his reaction might be understandable.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not necessarily in the wrong, especially since he's protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement. However, the method of using an ultimatum could be questioned. But given the context, the core issue is about respecting the initial agreement and the child's upbringing. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
