She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the husband is an atheist and the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife had an agreement about secular upbringing. The husband is concerned about religious influence from his in-laws, especially after the father took the child to the mosque without consent. The husband is firm in his stance, even threatening divorce if the situation continues. The wife seems conflicted but is happy at home with her husband's lifestyle but under pressure from her family.\n\nI should think about parental rights and responsibilities. Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. The husband's objection to religious indoctrination without his consent is a valid concern. However, the wife might be caught between her family's expectations and her marriage. The father-in-law's actions are against the parents' agreement, which could be problematic. The husband is asserting his right to co-parenting decisions, which is important for the child's well-being. \n\nBut maybe the husband could have handled it differently. Threatening divorce over this might be extreme. However, given the circumstances, if the wife is not upholding their agreement and the in-laws are interfering, the husband's stance could be seen as protecting his child's upbringing. The wife's compliance or lack of action in stopping her father might also play a role. It's a complex situation with cultural and familial dynamics at play. \n\nI need to weigh the husband's right to co-parenting against the wife's family influence. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of the agreed-upon parenting plan. The husband's frustration is understandable, but threatening divorce is a significant consequence. However, if the wife isn't preventing her father's actions despite knowing the husband's position, the husband's response might be justified. \n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's approach might be harsh, his concerns about his son's upbringing are valid. The wife's inaction in preventing her father's interference could contribute to the problem. The father-in-law's disregard for the parents' agreement is also an issue. The husband might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for better communication and resolution methods. However, given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his beliefs and protecting his child's upbringing.\n"
