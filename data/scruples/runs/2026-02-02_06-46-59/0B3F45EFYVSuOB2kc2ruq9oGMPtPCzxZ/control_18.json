She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. They had agreed their child would be raised secular. However, the wife's father took their son to the mosque without consent. The author is threatening divorce if she continues to let this happen.\n\nHmm, the key points here are mutual agreements, parental authority, and the father-in-law's interference. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing, but the wife's family is pressuring her, and she might be going along with it despite the agreement. The author is upset that his child is being exposed to religion against his wishes, leading to the threat of divorce.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author is standing by his original agreement, which the wife might be breaking by allowing her father's influence. However, the wife might be under pressure from her family, which complicates things. Is it fair to threaten divorce over this? Well, the author is protecting his child's upbringing, which is a valid concern. But is he overreacting? Maybe, if the wife isn't directly violating their agreement but her family is. But if she's enabling her father's actions despite prior agreement, then the author has a point.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions are problematic. He's taking the child without consent, which is a breach of the parents' authority. The author has a right to be upset about that. However, threatening divorce over this might depend on how the wife is handling it. If the wife is complicit, maybe the author is justified. But if she's being pressured and trying to navigate it, maybe the author is being too harsh.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's mental health. She's happy in her home but comes back depressed after seeing her father. The author is concerned about her well-being too. So he's not just about the child's upbringing but also her treatment. That adds another layer of concern.\n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the author hasn't broken any promises, but the wife might be. If she agreed to a secular upbringing and is allowing her father to influence the child, she's going against their agreement. The author's response is about protecting his child and his marriage's original terms. However, threatening divorce is a strong move. Is it reasonable? It might depend on cultural context and the couple's communication. If they couldn't resolve it through discussion and the wife continued to act against the agreement, then the author's stance could be seen as justified.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he's being rigid and not considering the wife's position, maybe A. But if the wife is violating their agreement, then B. The father-in-law's actions are definitely wrong, but the wife's role is key here. If she's not preventing her father's actions, she's complicit. The author's threat is a response to that complicity. So, in that light, the author isn't in the wrong because the wife is not following through on their agreement. Hence, B.\n"
