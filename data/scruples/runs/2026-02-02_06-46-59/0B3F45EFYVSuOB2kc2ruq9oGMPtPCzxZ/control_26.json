She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim, despite them having agreed to raise the child secularly. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family, and the author is an atheist. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, leading to the author's ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple agreed to secular upbringing, but the wife is now influenced by her family's religious practices. The author feels his boundaries are violated as the father in law is involved without his consent. The wife might be conflicted between her husband and her family's expectations.\n\nThe laws regarding child rearing vary, but generally, both parents have a say. However, since the author is the father, he has a right to be involved in decisions about his child's upbringing. The father-in-law's actions without consent could be problematic, as it's not just the wife's decision but also the husband's. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's been clear about his stance.\n\nThe wife's actions, if she's allowing her father to take the child without informing the husband, might be seen as going against their agreement. The author's threat to divorce is serious, but it's based on his disagreement with the religious upbringing and the breach of their prior agreement.\n\nHowever, the wife might have her own reasons, possibly feeling pressure from her family or struggling with her own beliefs. She might be caught between her husband and her family, leading to the depression and shame mentioned. The author's ultimatum could be seen as extreme, but the father-in-law's interference without consent is a significant issue.\n\nIn terms of rights, both parents should have mutual agreement on the child's upbringing. The father-in-law's involvement without the father's consent is a problem, as the child has a right to not be exposed to religious indoctrination against the parents' wishes. The author's stance is about protecting his child's future choices and respecting their initial agreement.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing by his values and the agreement made with his wife. The wife might need to address her family's influence and the father-in-law's overstepping. The author's threat, while harsh, is a response to uncooperative behavior from the wife and her family, which violates their agreed terms.\n"
