She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with conflicting religious beliefs regarding raising their child. The husband is an atheist and they agreed to raise their son secularly. The wife is from a Muslim family, and even though she was agnostic before, she's now being influenced by her family. Her father took the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, leading the husband to threaten divorce.\n\nFirst, the husband's stance is about protecting his son from religion, which he personally opposes. The wife, however, might be feeling torn between her spouse and her family. The initial agreement was secular upbringing, but the wife might be under pressure from her family. The father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's influencing the child without the father's consent. The husband's response is to threaten divorce, which is a serious step. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the wife might have her own autonomy. Even though they agreed on secular upbringing, maybe she's now changing her mind or feels pressured. The husband is enforcing his view strictly, which could be controlling. However, the father-in-law's interference without consent is definitely an issue. The husband is defending his parental rights. \n\nBut the question is about the husband being in the wrong. If he's threatening divorce over this, maybe he's not considering his wife's perspective. The wife might feel trapped between her family and her husband. The husband might be overreacting, but the father-in-law's actions are also wrong. It's a complex situation. The husband has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing, but threatening divorce immediately might be excessive. So maybe the answer is A, the husband is in the wrong, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
