She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between a husband and wife with differing religious views. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. Now that their son is born, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, are pressuring to have the child in their mosque. The wife's father took the son without the husband's knowledge, dressed him in Muslim clothes, and the husband is threatening divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, the husband's main issue is about the child's upbringing against his wishes. The wife seems to be caught between her family's expectations and her husband's. The husband feels that her father is exerting control over her and the child, which he's not okay with. He's at a point where he's willing to divorce her if the situation doesn't change.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, so the husband has a right to his say in the child's upbringing. However, the wife is an adult and has her own autonomy. The problem is that the husband is threatening divorce, which is a major consequence. Is that a fair response?\n\nThe wife's actions: she agreed on secular upbringing but her father is acting without consent. The husband found out about the unauthorized visit to the mosque. The wife's behavior might be influenced by her family's pressure, but she's also in a marriage where she's happy at home. The husband is frustrated because he feels his wishes are being ignored, and the father-in-law isn't respecting his role.\n\nIs the husband justified in threatening divorce? Well, it's his right to set boundaries. However, using divorce as a threat because of a fundamental disagreement on child-rearing is serious. It might depend on whether there's room for compromise. The wife might still be trying to navigate her family's expectations, but the husband is firm. The father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's not the parent and shouldn't be making decisions without the other parent's consent.\n\nLegally, both parents have rights, so the husband is right to assert his. Ethically, threatening divorce is a big step, but if the core value (secular upbringing) is non-negotiable, it's understandable. The wife's actions might be a betrayal if she's not honoring their agreement. The husband's stance is about protecting his son from religious indoctrination against his will. However, the wife's autonomy is also a factor. The husband might be in the right if the wife is allowing her family to override their agreement. But the way he's handling it by threatening divorce might be extreme, but given the circumstances, maybe not entirely wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author (the husband) is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
