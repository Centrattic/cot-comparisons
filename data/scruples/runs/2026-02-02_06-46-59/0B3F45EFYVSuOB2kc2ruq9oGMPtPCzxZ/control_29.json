She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce if his wife continues to raise their son as Muslim. The key points here are the parents' agreement on secular upbringing, the father's atheism, the mother's immigrant background with a fundamentalist family, and the father-in-law's actions against the father's wishes.\n\nFirst, the couple had an agreement before having kids that their children would be raised secular. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was agnostic. So, the husband's main issue is that the wife is now going against their agreement by allowing the father-in-law to expose the child to Islam. The father-in-law took the baby to the mosque without consent, which is a direct violation of their agreement. The husband feels that his parental rights are being disregarded, especially since he's a co-parent and the father-in-law is influencing the child without his approval.\n\nThe wife might be under pressure from her family, which is a common issue in intercultural or interfaith marriages. She's caught between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. However, the husband is standing by his original agreement, which he thought they had both agreed to. The fact that the father-in-law is ignoring the husband's wishes adds to the conflict. The husband's threat of divorce is a serious step, but he's doing it to protect his son's upbringing according to their prior agreement.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, both parents have rights regarding their child's upbringing. If the husband is not the legal guardian or if there's no legal agreement, the wife might have some autonomy. But in this case, they are married, and the father is part of the parenting decisions. The father-in-law's actions without consent could be seen as undermining the father's role. The husband's stance is about protecting his son from religious indoctrination against their agreement.\n\nHowever, the wife's actions in allowing this might be influenced by her family pressure. The husband is frustrated because the wife isn't stopping it, even though she agreed to the secular upbringing. The key here is whether the husband's threat is justified. He's standing his ground on a prior agreement, which the wife is not upholding. But threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, even if the husband is in a moral conflict.\n\nBut considering the context: the father-in-law is actively trying to influence the child without consent, and the wife isn't stopping it. The husband's main concern is the child's upbringing, which is a critical issue. Parents do have the right to make decisions about their child's education and religion. Since the child is very young, early exposure can be significant. The husband is trying to protect his son's future, even if it means splitting from his wife.\n\nSo, weighing the arguments, the husband isn't in the wrong because he's upholding the agreement they made, protecting his son from unwanted religious influence, and standing up to his in-laws who are acting against his wishes. The wife's actions are influenced by family pressure, but the husband's response is about enforcing their prior agreement and parental rights. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
