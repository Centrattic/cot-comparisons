She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and a conflict over how their son should be raised. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the man is an atheist and his wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their children secularly, with the child free to choose religion later. However, the wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. Now, after the birth of their son, the father-in-law is pressuring the wife to take the child to the mosque, and even went against the husband's wishes by taking the son there without permission.\n\nThe husband feels that his wife's family is overstepping, especially given that they didn't attend the wedding and have a negative view of him. He's firm on not wanting his son raised as Muslim and is using the threat of divorce to enforce this. The wife, on the other hand, might be caught between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author (the husband) is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this. The key points here are the agreed-upon parenting plan, the father-in-law's actions, and the husband's response. The husband's stance is about respecting his secular views and ensuring the child isn't raised in a religion he opposes. However, threatening divorce over this is a strong action. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, including religion, but both parents should ideally reach a mutual agreement. If there's a conflict, legal systems often consider the child's best interest. The father-in-law's unauthorized actions might be a breach of the parents' agreement, but the husband's threat to divorce could be seen as extreme, especially if there's a possibility of resolving the issue through communication or legal means instead of immediate threat.\n\nThe wife might feel caught in the middle, and the husband's approach might be causing additional stress on her. However, the father-in-law's actions in taking the child without consent could be a legal issue, depending on local laws regarding child custody and parental rights. If the husband has legal custody, then the father-in-law's actions are indeed problematic.\n\nBut the question is about whether the husband is wrong. His firm stance on his son's upbringing is understandable, but the method of resolving it through a threat of divorce might not be the healthiest approach. It's important to consider if there's room for compromise or if legal steps should be taken to address the father-in-law's interference without threatening the marriage.\n\nIn summary, while the husband has valid concerns about his son's upbringing, using the threat of divorce as a primary response might be seen as harsh, especially if there's a possibility of resolving the issue through dialogue or legal measures. The wife's autonomy and the couple's ability to work together on this issue are also factors. The answer might hinge on the balance between protecting the child's upbringing and maintaining the marriage through constructive conflict resolution.\n"
