She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with conflicting religious views on raising their child. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is influencing their son without the husband's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife had an agreement about secular upbringing. The father-in-law is taking the child to the mosque without permission, which the husband objects to. The husband is considering divorce if the wife continues to allow this. \n\nNow, the legal aspect: In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. However, if one parent is acting against the other's wishes without consent, it could be a legal issue. The husband is trying to prevent the religious influence, which the wife might be complicit in by allowing her father to take the child. \n\nEmotionally, the wife seems conflicted. She's happy at home but comes back depressed after seeing her father. The husband is trying to protect his son from what he sees as unwanted religious indoctrination. However, he's also making a ultimatum about divorce, which is a serious step. \n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, he's standing up for his values and his rights as a parent. But using divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme. However, given the situation and the breach of their initial agreement, some might see it as justified. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be under pressure from her family and could be struggling with her own beliefs. The husband's approach might be harsh, but it's about protecting his child's upbringing. It's a conflict of values and parental rights. \n\nI think the answer depends on the cultural and legal context, but based on the information given, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to uphold the agreement and protect his child from unwanted religious influence without the other parent's consent. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
