She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is married to his wife for two years. They agreed that their kids would be raised secular. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family, but when they met, she was agnostic. Now that they have a son, the wife's father has taken the baby to the mosque without the author's knowledge, dressing him in Muslim clothes. The author feels that his father-in-law is exerting control over his wife and son, even though he's white and from a Christian background. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let her family influence their son's upbringing against the agreed secular plan.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide for myself. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the couple had an agreement about raising their child secular. The wife agreed to that. Now the father-in-law is acting against that agreement, and the wife might be complicit by not stopping her father. The author feels that the father-in-law is undermining his authority as a parent. He's saying he can't let his son be raised that way, even if it means splitting up. \n\nOn one hand, parental rights are important. If parents agree on a child's upbringing, and one parent is going against that agreement without consent, that's a problem. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of trust. The author is standing up for his beliefs and the agreement they had. But on the other hand, the wife's family might feel they're trying to preserve cultural or religious traditions. The wife might be influenced by her family, even if she's an adult. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that the wife agreed to secular upbringing. If she's allowing her father to take the child and do religious things, is she violating their agreement? If the wife isn't stopping her father, that could be an issue. The author is trying to enforce the agreement they had. However, threatening divorce over this might be extreme. Maybe there's a way to resolve it without splitting up. Also, the wife's mental health is mentioned\u2014she gets depressed after seeing her father. That suggests there's emotional pressure on her from her family.\n\nBut the key point is the agreement between the couple. If the wife is not upholding her end, the author has a right to be upset. However, the author's response is to threaten divorce. Is that justified? Divorce is a major decision. Maybe the author should work with the wife to address the issue, not just assume she's violating the agreement. Perhaps the wife is struggling with her family's influence and the author isn't supporting her in resisting that. \n\nAlso, the father-in-law taking the child without consent is a problem. The author has a right to be the sole parent in deciding the child's upbringing unless there's a legal agreement otherwise. If the wife is allowing this, maybe she's not protecting her son's interests as per her agreement with her husband. \n\nBut the author's approach of threatening divorce immediately might not consider the wife's position. Maybe there's a middle ground. For example, family therapy to address the conflicts, setting boundaries with the in-laws, etc. However, the author feels that the situation is beyond negotiation because the father-in-law is ignoring him and the wife isn't stopping it. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, unless there's a legal custody arrangement, both parents have equal rights. But since they're married, the author is the legal parent. However, the wife's actions in letting her father interfere might be seen as a breach of their agreement. \n\nEmotionally, the author is trying to protect his son from being influenced against their agreement. Threatening divorce might be a strong reaction, but if the wife isn't taking steps to prevent her father from doing this, the author might feel he has no choice. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's upholding the agreement they made. The wife's family is interfering without consent, and the wife isn't preventing it. However, the method of resolving it (threatening divorce) could be seen as harsh. But given the circumstances, maybe it's a valid stance. Alternatively, maybe the author should have tried to work with the wife first. But the wife might be struggling with her family's pressure. \n\nIn the end, if the agreement was clear and the wife is not preventing her father from violating it, the author is justified in taking a strong stance. However, the approach could be more collaborative. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's acting to protect the agreed-upon upbringing of the child, I think he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
