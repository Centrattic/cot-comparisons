She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over how their son is being raised.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secular. Now, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, is pressuring them. The wife's father took their son to the mosque without consent. The author is upset because he doesn't want the religion imposed on his son. He told his wife he'd divorce her if she continues to raise the son as Muslim.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is from an immigrant family with strict views. The author's background is Christian but he's an atheist. The wife's family doesn't like him for being white. There's a history of pressure from her father, which makes the wife depressed. The author feels his parental rights are being violated by the grandfather's actions.\n\nThe key issue is the child's upbringing. The couple had a mutual agreement, but the wife might be influenced by her family. The author is standing firm on his beliefs, but is his threat to divorce appropriate? Divorce over religious upbringing is a big decision. There's a power imbalance here because the wife's family is exerting control, and she's an adult but perhaps under pressure. The author is protecting his son's upbringing, but is his ultimatum respectful? He's not wrong to have a stance, but threatening divorce might be extreme unless there's consensus. However, he's also the parent, and has the right to decide his child's upbringing. The wife's father's actions are unauthorized, so the author has a valid reason to be upset. The wife's compliance with her family might be the root issue. But is the author overstepping by threatening divorce? It's a complicated situation. Legally, parents have equal rights, but in practice, if one parent is being coerced, it's different. The author is defending his own values, but maybe he should work with the wife to resolve the issue without divorce. However, he's already tried to communicate and failed. So maybe B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
