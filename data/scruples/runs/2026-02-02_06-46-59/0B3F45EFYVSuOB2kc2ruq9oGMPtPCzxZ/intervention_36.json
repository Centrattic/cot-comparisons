She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce if his wife continues to raise their son as Muslim. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife had an agreement that their children would be raised secular. The wife agreed, but now she's being influenced by her fundamentalist Muslim family. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without permission, which the author is upset about. The author is an atheist, the wife was agnostic before, but now seems to be under pressure from her family. The father-in-law is not respecting the author's wishes and is controlling the wife, leading to tension.\n\nThe author's main point is that he doesn't want his son raised Muslim against his wishes. He feels that his in-laws are pressuring his wife, and he's taken a firm stance to protect his son's upbringing. He's even said he'll divorce his wife if she continues to go along with this. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for his beliefs and protecting his child from religious influence he doesn't support. He has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing, and the father-in-law acting without consent could be problematic. However, the author is threatening divorce, which is a serious consequence. The wife might be caught in the middle between her family and her husband. The author is making assumptions about her actions, maybe not considering her feelings or autonomy as a parent. Also, using divorce as a threat could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is trying to navigate her own identity and family pressures.\n\nBut then, the father-in-law's actions are unauthorized and against the agreed-upon parenting plan. The author has a right to be involved in decisions about his child's upbringing. The wife's family's disapproval of him as a white man adds to the tension, and their behavior might be manipulative. The author is trying to prevent his son from being exposed to a religion he opposes, which is a valid concern for a parent.\n\nHowever, the way the author is handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. It could be seen as ultimatum-based rather than collaborative problem-solving. The wife might feel that her autonomy is being undermined, especially if she's trying to balance her own beliefs and her family's expectations. The author's statement that \"she's an adult and can do what she wants\" seems contradictory because he's imposing consequences for her choices.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, both parents have equal rights to their child's upbringing unless there's a court order. But this is more about personal ethics and the relationship dynamics. The author is prioritizing his secular values over his wife's current actions, which might be influenced by her family. It's a conflict between parental rights and the wife's agency.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's using divorce as a threat over a deeply personal and sensitive issue, it might be excessive. However, if he's protecting his child from unwanted religious influence by someone who isn't their parent, he has a point. The key is whether the threat of divorce is justified given the circumstances. The wife's role here is also important\u2014she might be complicit in allowing her father to act against the agreed parenting plan, which complicates things.\n\nI think the answer depends on how the situation is viewed. If the author's actions are seen as overreacting and not giving his wife the autonomy to handle her own decisions, then he might be in the wrong. But if the father-in-law's actions are a breach of trust and the author is trying to protect his child, then he's justified. However, threatening divorce seems harsh. Maybe a more constructive approach would be better, like mediation or legal intervention, rather than ending the marriage. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong because he's using an extreme measure without addressing the issue collaboratively.\n"
