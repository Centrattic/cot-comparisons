She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a man who is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. They had agreed to raise their kids secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without consent. The author says he told his wife he'd divorce her if she continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to his religious views and his parenting decisions. He and his wife agreed on secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring them, and her father is acting against the father's wishes. The wife might be struggling between her family's expectations and her husband's. But the author is threatening divorce over this. Is that justified?\n\nThe wife might be in a difficult position, especially if her family is controlling. She might feel torn between her husband and her family. The author's strict stance could be seen as not giving her a chance to resolve the issue without divorce. However, the father's primary concern is his child's upbringing without religious indoctrination against his will. He's also protecting his son from his in-laws' influence.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have rights to make decisions about their child's upbringing. If the father is objecting to religious education, he has a right to assert that. But threatening divorce over it could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is trying to navigate family pressure. However, the father might feel that his boundaries are crossed, and he's standing up for his beliefs and his child's future.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's autonomy. The author says she's an adult and can do what she wants, but he's using a divorce threat to enforce his will. That could be problematic because it might undermine her agency. However, if she's not standing up to her family and is complicit in the actions against his wishes, maybe he's justified in setting such a boundary.\n\nI need to think about cultural context too. The wife's family is from a different background, and there might be cultural expectations influencing her actions. The author might not have considered the pressures she faces, which could affect his judgment. But he's also clear about his stance on raising the child secularly, which is important for him.\n\nIn summary, the author has valid concerns about his son's upbringing and his wife's family's influence. However, threatening divorce as a consequence might be an extreme measure. It depends on whether there are other ways to resolve the issue. But since he's already tried to communicate and the in-laws are ignoring him, he might feel this is the only option left. The answer might be B, meaning he's not in the wrong, because he's standing by his parenting decisions and protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement.\n"
