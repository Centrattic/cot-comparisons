She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with conflicting views on raising their son religiously. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They initially agreed to raise their children secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, leading to the husband threatening divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's main concern is that the child is being exposed to religious practices without his consent, which he agreed not to happen. The wife, on the other hand, might feel torn between her family and her husband. The father-in-law is exerting influence, and the wife is struggling with her own family's expectations versus her marriage. The husband is taking a firm stance, which is understandable given the initial agreement, but maybe his reaction is too harsh?\n\nI need to think about the dynamics here. The couple had an agreement on secular upbringing. The wife's father is acting against that agreement by taking the child to the mosque. The husband is trying to protect his child's upbringing, which is a valid parental concern. However, threatening divorce is a severe response. The question is whether the husband overreacted.\n\nIn many cases, communication is key. If the husband had tried to address the issue with his wife first, perhaps seeking compromise or understanding, before resorting to ultimatums, that might have been better. However, the wife is already under pressure from her family, and the father-in-law is not respecting the husband's wishes. The husband might feel that his boundaries are being crossed, and he's trying to protect his son.\n\nBut is threatening divorce the right approach here? Divorce is a major consequence. It's possible that the husband is in the right in wanting to protect his child's upbringing but wrong in the method of using an ultimatum. Alternatively, if the wife is not honoring the agreement and is allowing her father to influence their child, the husband's stance is justified.\n\nI also need to consider cultural aspects. The wife's family is very religious, but the couple had agreed on a secular upbringing. The father-in-law's actions are undermining that agreement, which the husband has a right to be upset about. However, the wife's autonomy is also a factor. Is she responsible for her father's actions, or is the father overstepping?\n\nAnother angle: the husband is not the one directly taking the child to the mosque. The father-in-law did it without their knowledge. The husband's reaction might be based on the fact that the wife didn't stop it, implying she's complicit. But maybe she tried to and couldn't. The husband might be holding her responsible for her father's actions.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, parents typically share responsibility for their child's upbringing. If one parent is allowing a third party (the father-in-law) to influence the child in a way the other parent opposes, that could be a problem. However, the husband's threat of divorce seems extreme unless all other avenues have been exhausted.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the husband's response is proportional to the situation. If the wife is not respecting the agreed-upon secular upbringing by allowing her father to take the child, then the husband has a valid reason to be upset. But threatening divorce might be too harsh unless there's a pattern of behavior that can't be resolved otherwise. On the other hand, if the father-in-law's actions are a one-time incident and the wife is otherwise committed to secular upbringing, the husband might be overreacting.\n\nI think the husband is partially in the right in wanting to protect his son's upbringing but is in the wrong for threatening divorce without trying to resolve the issue through discussion or mediation first. However, given the father-in-law's continued disregard for the husband's wishes, maybe the husband's stance is justified as a last resort. It's a tough call. The key is whether the husband's actions are a reasonable response to the violation of their agreement."
