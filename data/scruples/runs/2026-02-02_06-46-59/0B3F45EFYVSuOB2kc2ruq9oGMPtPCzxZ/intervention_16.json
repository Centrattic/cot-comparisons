She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with differing religious views and a disagreement over how to raise their child. The author, who identifies as an atheist, is threatening divorce if his wife continues to raise their son as Muslim. The wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family and has been under pressure from them, even though she initially agreed to raise the child secularly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to raise their child according to their beliefs, but there's also the aspect of parental agreement. Since both are parents, they should ideally agree on major decisions, including religion. The author's wife might be influenced by her family, which complicates things. The fact that the father-in-law took the child to the mosque without the author's consent is a key point. That action could be seen as overstepping, especially if the parents had a prior agreement.\n\nThe author is asserting his right as a parent to prevent his child from being raised in a religion he disagrees with. However, threatening divorce over this issue might be seen as extreme. The wife might feel trapped between her husband's wishes and her family's pressure. The author's approach of using the threat of divorce could be damaging to the marriage and might not address the underlying issues, like communication or the influence of the in-laws.\n\nEthically, while the author has a right to his beliefs, the way he's handling the situation\u2014threatening divorce and not allowing the wife to maintain her cultural ties\u2014could be problematic. It's important to balance personal beliefs with respect for the spouse's background and the child's exposure to both. Compromise might be necessary here. The author's stance could be seen as dismissive of his wife's heritage and the potential positive aspects of her culture. Additionally, the father-in-law's actions are questionable, but the author's response might be too harsh, especially considering the wife's happiness in their home versus the pressure from her family.\n\nIn terms of legal rights, it's likely that both parents have the right to be involved in the child's upbringing, and if there's a dispute, it would need to be resolved through mutual agreement or possibly mediation. The author's ultimatum without seeking resolution might not be the healthiest approach. It's possible that the author is not entirely in the wrong because he's protecting his child from unwanted religious influence, but his method could be seen as extreme and disrespectful to his wife's background. The key issue is whether the threat of divorce is an appropriate response to a disagreement in parenting style.\n"
