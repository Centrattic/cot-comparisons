She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to raise their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement to raise the child secularly. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is an atheist, and the wife was previously agnostic but comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had an agreement that their children would be raised secularly. However, the wife's father has been influencing the child, taking him to the mosque and dressing him in Muslim clothes without the author's consent. The author feels that the father-in-law is exerting control over his wife and their son, which he doesn't accept. He's now threatening divorce if the situation continues.\n\nNow, considering the laws around child custody and religious upbringing. In many jurisdictions, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, but there are exceptions if it involves harm or if one parent's actions interfere with the other's rights. However, the key here is that the parents had an agreement. The wife might be going against that agreement by allowing her father to influence the child. \n\nBut the wife is an adult and has her own rights. The author's threat to divorce is a serious action. However, if the wife is not respecting the agreed terms of their parenting plan, the author might have grounds to take legal action. But threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, especially since the wife might be under pressure from her family. There's also the question of whether the father-in-law's actions are legally permissible. If the father-in-law is taking the child without consent, that could be a legal issue.\n\nAnother angle is the mental health impact on the wife. She's described as being happy at home but depressed when interacting with her father. This suggests she's caught between two worlds. The author's stance might be about protecting his son, but it's also possible that the wife is being manipulated or pressured by her family. The author's threat could be seen as a way to assert control, but it's a drastic measure.\n\nCulturally, the wife's family might have strong beliefs that they want to pass on. The author's opposition is based on his atheism, which is valid, but the question is whether his threat to divorce is justified. In some legal systems, both parents have the right to be involved in a child's upbringing, but if one parent is acting against the other's wishes without consent, that could be a problem. However, the wife is an adult and might be making her own decisions, even if influenced by family.\n\nThe author's statement, \"she's an adult and can do what she wants\" might imply that he's not interfering with her personal choices, but he's concerned about the child. However, if the wife is allowing her father to influence the child against the author's wishes, that could be a breach of their agreement. The author might feel that his parental rights are being violated.\n\nIn summary, the author's position is that he wants to protect his son from religious upbringing against his wishes. The wife's actions, possibly under family pressure, are conflicting with that. The author's threat to divorce is a strong response, but if the wife is not honoring the agreement they made, he might have legitimate concerns. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as extreme. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like mediation or legal action, might be more appropriate. But given the circumstances, the author's stance could be considered justified in wanting to protect his child and uphold the parenting agreement, even if the method of resolving it is controversial.\n"
