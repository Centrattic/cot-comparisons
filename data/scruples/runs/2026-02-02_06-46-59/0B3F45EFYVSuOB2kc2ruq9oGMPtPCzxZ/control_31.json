She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious views. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was agnostic but now seems to be influenced by her Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and there's a breach of trust when the father-in-law takes the son without consent. The husband feels he's being undermined and is considering divorce to prevent his son from being raised Muslim. The wife, however, might be caught between her family and her marriage.\n\nLooking at the husband's perspective, he's standing by his original agreement and protecting his son's upbringing. He's taken steps to prevent the father-in-law from influencing the child, which he sees as against his wishes. The wife's actions, bringing the child to her father, might be a sign of her wavering from their agreement. The husband's threat of divorce is based on protecting his child's future and upholding their prenuptial agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel pressured by her family and could be struggling with her own identity and beliefs. However, the husband's stance is about respecting their prior agreement and ensuring the child isn't raised in a religion he opposed. The key here is whether the husband's actions are justified given the breach of their agreement and the unauthorized involvement of the father-in-law.\n\nLegally, parents generally have equal rights, but since the child is an infant, decisions would typically be made jointly. The husband's refusal to allow religious instruction without consent is a valid concern, especially when the other parent is taking the child without permission. The husband's threat of divorce isn't just about the religion but about the principle of honoring their agreement and the father-in-law's control over the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the husband is prioritizing the child's upbringing as per their mutual agreement. The wife's actions might be seen as going against that agreement, possibly due to family pressure. The husband's decision to enforce the agreement is about maintaining the terms they set before the child was born. While the wife's family might be a factor, the immediate issue is the unauthorized actions affecting their son.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's upholding the agreed-upon terms and protecting his child from unwanted religious influence. The wife's actions, while possibly influenced by her family, are a breach of their agreement. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
