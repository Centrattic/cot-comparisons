She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after threatening to divorce his wife over how their son is being raised. The author is an atheist, and they had agreed to raise their children secular. The wife is from a Muslim immigrant family, and her father is pressuring her to raise the child as Muslim. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without permission, leading the author to threaten divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have joint custody and decision-making rights. If one parent wants to raise the child in a certain religion and the other objects, it can become a legal issue. But in this case, the parents had an agreement beforehand. The wife might be going against that agreement by allowing her father to influence the child, which could be a breach of their initial agreement.\n\nHowever, the wife's family might be pressuring her, and she's an adult who can make her own choices. The author is frustrated because his son is being exposed to religion without his consent. But threatening divorce over this seems extreme. Marriage involves compromise, and while it's important to respect each other's beliefs, threatening divorce over a disagreement, especially involving children, can be seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the father-in-law's actions without consent could be problematic. The author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. If the wife is allowing this without her husband's consent, that's a point against her. But the author's response is to threaten divorce, which might be overreacting. Communication and possibly mediation might be better solutions before considering divorce.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's standing up for his beliefs and his child's upbringing, which is important. But threatening divorce immediately might not be the best approach. However, if the wife is breaking their agreement, the author has a right to be concerned. The situation is complex, but the author's response could be seen as extreme. Maybe a B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if his actions are justified.\n"
