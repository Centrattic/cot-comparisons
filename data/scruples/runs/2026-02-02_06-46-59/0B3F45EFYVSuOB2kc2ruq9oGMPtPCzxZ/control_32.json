She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The main issue is about a couple with differing religious beliefs and a disagreement over how to raise their son.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic. They agreed their kids would be raised secular. Now, the wife's father, a fundamentalist Muslim, is pressuring her to take the son to the mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes without the husband's knowledge. The husband feels that his wife is going against their agreement and his wishes, leading him to threaten divorce.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The parents have a pre-existing agreement on secular upbringing. The father-in-law is interfering by taking the child to religious activities without the husband's consent. The wife might be influenced by her family's pressure, which the husband is frustrated with because it's against their original agreement.\n\nThe husband's main concern is about his parental rights and the child's upbringing. He's worried about his son being exposed to religious indoctrination without his consent. However, the wife is an adult and has her own family background. There's a power dynamic here with the in-laws exerting pressure, which is affecting the wife's mental health as well.\n\nThe question is whether threatening divorce over this is justified. In many legal systems, both parents have equal rights regarding their children's upbringing. If the wife is complying with her family's wishes against the husband's objections, it could be a conflict. However, the husband's approach of threatening divorce might be seen as extreme, especially since the wife is caught in the middle of family pressure. It's possible that the husband should seek mediation or legal solutions rather than immediately threatening to end the marriage.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions\u2014taking the child without consent\u2014could be a legal issue depending on custody agreements. The husband has valid concerns about his parental rights, but the way he's handling it (threatening divorce) might be seen as harsh if there's no other resolution attempted first.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the husband is standing by his convictions about secular upbringing, but the wife is under family pressure. The husband's solution of divorce might not address the underlying issues of family influence and communication. It's possible that the author is in the wrong for not seeking other solutions before threatening to end the marriage, but the father-in-law's interference is also a problem.\n\nSo, the answer could be nuanced. The husband has valid concerns about his child's upbringing, but the method of resolving it through an ultimatum might be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's threatening divorce over a complex family issue without considering other avenues. Alternatively, if the father-in-law's actions are a clear violation, then the husband's stance might be justified, making the answer B.\n"
