She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author is a husband in a two-year marriage. His wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. He's an atheist, and initially, they agreed that their kids would be raised secular. However, the wife's family is pressuring the son to be raised as Muslim. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, despite the husband's objections. The husband has told his wife he'll divorce her if she continues to allow this.\n\nSo, the key points here are about parental rights, religious upbringing of the child, and the husband's authority in the marriage. The husband feels that his wife is going against their agreement by letting her father influence their son. The wife, on the other hand, might be under pressure from her family and possibly feels torn between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising a child, including religious upbringing. However, if there's a conflict, the courts usually consider the child's best interest. The husband's stance is firm, but does that mean he's in the wrong? Well, if the wife is an adult and making her own choices, even if they conflict with the husband's wishes, the husband can't unilaterally decide on divorce solely based on that. Especially since both parents have a say in religious upbringing. \n\nBut wait, the husband mentions that the father-in-law is acting against his wishes. So there's an external influence here. The wife might be complicit by allowing her father to take the child without consent. However, the husband's response is to threaten divorce, which is a heavy action. Divorce over a disagreement about religious upbringing could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is also an adult and making choices. The husband might be overreacting, especially if the wife is not entirely aligning with her family but is being pressured. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband has a right to be concerned about his son's upbringing. If the wife is not standing by their initial agreement, he has a legitimate grievance. But does that justify threatening divorce? It might depend on the context. The wife's actions could be seen as a breach of their agreement, but the husband's solution is to end the marriage, which is a significant step. \n\nAlso, cultural factors might play a role here. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she might feel caught between her husband and her family. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the husband's threat to divorce his wife might not address the underlying issue with her father. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the husband might be overreacting by threatening divorce instead of addressing the issue through communication, mediation, or legal means. Threatening divorce over a disagreement about religious upbringing could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is also being influenced by her family. The husband could be at fault for not seeking compromise or for not considering his wife's perspective. \n\nAlternatively, the husband might be justified in standing firm on his beliefs, especially if he agreed to have children only under secular upbringing. If the wife is going against that agreement, the husband could feel betrayed. However, threatening divorce immediately might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the husband's actions might be seen as wrong because he's using divorce as a threat without exploring other solutions. The wife's actions are also questionable, but the husband's response is extreme. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
