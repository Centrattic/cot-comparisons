She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with different religious beliefs. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was initially agnostic but now seems to be returning to her Muslim roots. They had agreed to raise their kids secularly, but the wife's father is pressuring them, even taking the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge.\n\nThe husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow her father to influence their son. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the husband's main issue is that the wife's family is pressuring her and their son into religion against his wishes. He feels his agreement to a secular upbringing is being violated. The wife had agreed initially, but now her father is acting independently. The husband is trying to protect his son from religious influence, which he didn't consent to.\n\nBut wait, the wife is an adult. If she's choosing to engage with her family and religion, even if it's against her husband's wishes, where do we draw the line? The husband is taking a hard stance, threatening divorce. Is that justified? Raising a child is a shared responsibility, but in many places, both parents have the right to influence their children's upbringing. However, if one parent is acting against the other's wishes without consent, that becomes a problem.\n\nThe husband's father-in-law is taking the child without permission, which is definitely a violation. The husband's right to parent his child is being undermined. However, the wife's autonomy is also a factor. If she's allowing her father to do this, maybe she's not standing up for her husband's wishes. But she was initially on board with the secular upbringing. Maybe the pressure from her family is affecting her decisions now.\n\nThe husband's threat of divorce over this issue\u2014could that be seen as coercive? If he's using divorce as a leverage point because the wife isn't complying with his wishes, that might be problematic. But he's trying to protect his child's upbringing, which is a significant concern. In some cultures, religious upbringing is considered very important, but the husband is an atheist and didn't agree to this. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the in-laws not liking the husband because he's white. That adds a layer of cultural or ethnic tension. The wife is caught between her family and her spouse. The husband is trying to assert his parental rights, while the wife might be struggling to balance her family's expectations with her husband's.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights, and neither can unilaterally decide the child's religious upbringing without the other's consent. If the husband is the legal parent and the wife is allowing her father to influence the child without the husband's consent, that could be a legal issue. However, the wife is an adult and might have her own autonomy, but when it comes to the child's upbringing, both parents' consent is typically required.\n\nThe husband's approach of threatening divorce is extreme, but if the wife is consistently allowing her family to override his parenting rights, there's valid concern. However, the way he's handling it\u2014flat out telling her he'll divorce her if she continues\u2014might be too harsh. There's a lack of communication or attempt to resolve the issue together. He might need to seek mediation or legal advice first rather than immediately threatening divorce.\n\nIn summary, the husband has a valid concern about his son's upbringing, and the father-in-law's actions are problematic. However, the husband's response threatens the marriage without perhaps exhausting other options. The wife's complicity or lack of action in preventing her father's interference is also a factor. The husband may be protecting his rights, but the method could be seen as overly harsh, especially if the wife is struggling to balance her family and marriage. So, the author might be in the wrong for using divorce as a threat without addressing the issue more collaboratively.\n"
