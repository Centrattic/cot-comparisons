She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist who married a woman who was previously agnostic. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. Now, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, are pressuring them. The father-in-law took their son to the mosque without permission, dressed him in Muslim clothes. The author feels that his wife is being controlled by her family and is upset that his son is being exposed to religion against his wishes. He's threatening divorce if she continues to raise the son as Muslim.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the original agreement between the couple, the father-in-law's actions without consent, and the author's response. The wife seems to be torn, as she's happy at home but depressed around her family. The author is standing by his initial agreement but feels betrayed by her actions, possibly because he thinks she's secretly allowing the father-in-law to influence their son.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a right to be involved in his son's upbringing. The father-in-law's actions are definitely without consent, which is a problem. But the wife's role is important here. Did she know about the father taking the child to the mosque? The author says he told her but she continued to allow it. If she's complicit, then maybe she's at fault. But if she's being coerced by her family, that's another angle.\n\nThe author is threatening divorce, which is a heavy step. However, the father-in-law's interference without consent is a breach of the parents' agreement. The author's concern is about his son's upbringing, which is a valid parental concern. On the other hand, the wife might need to take responsibility for not protecting her child's upbringing as agreed.\n\nBut the author's approach is to threaten divorce rather than work with his wife to resolve the issue. Maybe he should have communicated more with her first, or sought mediation. However, the father-in-law is not cooperating, so the author feels cornered. His stance is that he won't allow the son to be raised in a way he disagrees with, even if it means ending the marriage.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, in many places, both parents have equal rights in child custody. If one parent is acting against the other's wishes without consent, that's problematic. However, the wife is also part of the equation. If she's allowing or participating in the father-in-law's actions, then she might share some responsibility.\n\nSo, the author's position is that he's standing up for his agreed-upon parenting decisions. The father-in-law's interference is a red line for him. The wife's role is a bit ambiguous here. If she's not supporting his stance and is allowing the father to take the child, that's a betrayal of their agreement.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for threatening divorce? It's a drastic measure, but given that the other parent (his wife) isn't preventing the father-in-law's actions, maybe he sees this as the only way to protect his son. However, divorce should be a last resort, and he might need to address this with his wife first, ensuring she's on the same page.\n\nAlternatively, if the wife is being manipulated by her family and is not able to assert her own wishes, then the author is trying to protect both his son and his wife from her family's influence. In that case, his actions are reasonable.\n\nI think the main issue is the father-in-law's unauthorized influence on the child. The author's reaction is about protecting his son's upbringing. The wife's complicity or lack thereof is a key factor. If the wife is not preventing the father-in-law's actions, then the author's frustration is justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his parenting decisions and protecting his son from unwanted religious influence without consent. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, and the author is trying to enforce the agreement made with his wife. However, the approach of threatening divorce might be harsh, but the underlying issue is valid.\n"
