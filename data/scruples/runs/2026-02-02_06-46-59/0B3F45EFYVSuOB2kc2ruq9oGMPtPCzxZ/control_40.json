She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over religious upbringing of their son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife agreed to raise their kids secular. The wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family, but she was agnostic when they married. Now, after the son is born, the father-in-law is taking the child to the mosque without permission. The author is upset because he doesn't want the religion imposed on his son. He's told his wife he'll divorce her if she continues to let this happen.\n\nSo, the main points are: parental rights, religious upbringing, and control by the in-laws. The author is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now might be influenced by her family. The husband is standing his ground on the agreed-upon secular upbringing, even threatening divorce. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, parents have the right to make decisions for their children, including religious upbringing. However, in many places, both parents have equal say. If one parent is being overruled, that's an issue. The father-in-law is acting without consent, which is a problem. The wife might be complicit by allowing it, even if she's conflicted.\n\nBut the author's response is to threaten divorce. That's a drastic step. While the father's concerns are valid about not wanting his son raised against his wishes, divorce over this might be seen as extreme. The wife might not be the one directly responsible if her family is pressuring her. Also, the wife seems to be in a difficult position, trying to balance her family's expectations and her marriage.\n\nHowever, the father's stance is about protecting his child's upbringing. If the wife is not standing against her family's actions, maybe he's justified in setting a boundary. But threatening divorce because of religious differences in parenting could be problematic. It's important to consider if there's a way to resolve this without such a drastic measure, like mediation or legal steps to enforce custody decisions.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, both parents need to agree on major decisions. If the husband is the sole decision-maker, he might have legal grounds. But socially, threatening divorce over this might be seen as harsh. The wife might feel trapped between her family and her husband, and the husband's approach could be exacerbating the conflict rather than resolving it.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a complex situation. The author has valid concerns about his son's upbringing, but the response is extreme. The wife's role in this is also a factor\u2014if she's enabling the in-law's actions, but maybe she's under pressure. The key is whether there's a way to address the religious upbringing without divorce. Since the father-in-law is acting without consent, the husband's stance is about protecting his child, but the method of response is questionable. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his child's upbringing, but the threat of divorce is a heavy measure. However, depending on cultural and legal contexts, it's a nuanced issue. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong in general, not considering specific laws. So leaning towards B, he's not in the wrong because he's protecting his child's upbringing, but the approach is extreme. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong for not finding a middle ground. Hmm.\n"
