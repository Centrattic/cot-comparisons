She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a child where the husband is an atheist and the wife, from a Muslim immigrant family, is being pressured to raise their son as Muslim. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow her family to influence their son religiously against his wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights to raise their child, but when there's a conflict, the courts often prioritize the child's best interest. However, this is a family matter before it becomes legal. The husband's main argument is that the son should be raised secular as agreed, and he's taking a strong stance against the wife's family's influence. The wife, on the other hand, might feel caught between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations.\n\nThe husband mentions that the wife initially agreed to a secular upbringing. If that was part of their mutual agreement, then she going against that could be seen as a breach. However, it's also possible that the wife feels conflicted or pressured by her family. The father-in-law took the child to the mosque without permission, which is a direct violation of the husband's wishes. The husband is asserting his right to co-parent and make decisions about his child's upbringing.\n\nBut is threatening divorce over this issue justified? The husband is using a very ultimatum approach, which might be harsh. However, if the wife is not respecting the agreed-upon secular parenting and is allowing her family to have significant influence, the husband could see this as a major issue. The wife's family's behavior toward the husband (not attending the wedding, pressuring for the child to be Muslim) might have contributed to the tension.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's autonomy. The husband says she can choose to be Muslim if she wants when they're older, but now he's asserting control over her decisions regarding their child. There's a balance between respecting her heritage and enforcing their prior agreement. If the wife is being manipulated or controlled by her family, the husband's stance could be protecting the child's upbringing. However, it's also about the wife's agency\u2014she might be struggling with her own identity and family pressures.\n\nThe husband's statement about divorce being the consequence if the wife continues is a strong move. It could be seen as holding his ground on a principle he finds important (secular upbringing), or it could be an overreaction. The key here is whether the wife is actively working against his wishes or if she's being coerced by her family. If the wife is not in agreement with her family's actions but is still allowing it, that's part of the problem. If she's being pressured and not able to stand up to her family, the husband's strict stance might be understandable.\n\nBut threatening divorce over religious upbringing is a serious matter. In many cultures, religion is a deeply personal and sensitive issue. The husband's willingness to end the marriage over this suggests that it's a non-negotiable for him. However, the wife's background and her family's influence might make this a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The husband's actions could be protecting the child from unwanted religious influence, but his approach might also be seen as extreme and damaging to the marriage.\n\nLegal perspectives vary, but in terms of ethics, the husband is standing by his values and the agreement made with his wife. The wife might be compromising due to family pressure, which the husband finds unacceptable. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of trust, and the husband is trying to assert his parental rights. However, the use of divorce as a threat could be seen as extreme, especially if there's potential for resolution through communication or legal channels. But given the husband's firm stance and the importance he places on secular upbringing, it's a matter of whether his reaction is proportionate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband is asserting his right to co-parent and protect his child's upbringing, threatening divorce might be seen as an extreme response. However, if the prior agreement was clear and the wife is not respecting it, he's within his rights to take a strong stance. The answer might hinge on the specifics of their agreement and the wife's actions. Since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious, the analysis shows it's a nuanced situation. But based on the information, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement.\n"
