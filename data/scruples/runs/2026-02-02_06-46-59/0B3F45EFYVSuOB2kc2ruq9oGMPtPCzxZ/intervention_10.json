She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is pressuring them, and apparently the father took the baby to the mosque without the author's consent. The author then tells the wife he'll divorce her if she continues to try to raise their son as Muslim.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. If the parents can't agree, it can lead to conflict. The author's stance is that he doesn't want the child to be raised in the wife's religion, but the wife might feel torn between her husband and her family. \n\nThe wife agreed to a secular upbringing initially, but maybe her views have changed? The father-in-law's actions are a problem because he's taking the child without permission. The author is trying to prevent that, which seems protective. However, the author's threat of divorce is a strong move. Is it justified? It depends on whether the wife is actively going against their agreement or if the father-in-law is the main issue here. \n\nThe wife might be under pressure from her family, which is causing her to act against her initial agreement. The author is frustrated because the child is being exposed to religion without consent. But threatening divorce is a major consequence. Maybe the author should try to resolve the issue with the father-in-law instead of turning it into a marital problem? \n\nAlso, cultural factors play a role here. The wife's family disapproves of the husband, which complicates things. The wife's mental health is mentioned\u2014she becomes depressed after seeing her father. The author supports her when they're together but is strict about the religion. \n\nThe key points are: mutual agreement on secular upbringing, breach by the father-in-law, wife's possible complicity or coercion, and the author's ultimatum. The author is trying to protect his son's upbringing, but the method of divorce might be too harsh. Perhaps the wife is caught in the middle, and the author should work with her to address the father-in-law's actions rather than threatening the marriage. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's standing up for his beliefs and protecting his child. On the other, threatening divorce might be too extreme if the wife isn't directly violating their agreement but is being pressured. It's a complex situation. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong if he's protecting his child's upbringing, but some might argue that the threat of divorce is too harsh unless the wife is actively betraying their agreement. The line between protecting and controlling is thin here.\n"
