She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with conflicting religious views about raising their child. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, influenced by her fundamentalist family. The wife's father took their son to a mosque without the husband's knowledge, leading the husband to threaten divorce if she continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement beforehand that their children would be raised secular. The husband made it clear he didn't want the religion to be imposed. The wife's family is pressuring her, and her father is acting against the husband's wishes by involving the child in religious activities. The husband feels this is a breach of their agreement and is threatening divorce.\n\nNow, legal aspects come into play. In many jurisdictions, both parents have the right to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing, but this can be complicated when there are disagreements. However, the father is objecting to the mother acting without his consent. The mother might have a right to some autonomy, but the father's concerns about his beliefs and the agreement might also be valid.\n\nEmotionally, the wife seems conflicted. She's happy in her home but stressed around her family. The husband is protective of his son's upbringing, which is understandable given their prior agreement. The father-in-law's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially without the other parent's consent.\n\nMoral considerations: The husband is standing by his principles, while the wife may feel torn between her family and her husband. The threat of divorce over this issue is significant. It's possible the husband is not in the wrong because he's upholding their agreement and protecting his son from unwanted religious influence. However, the wife's autonomy and her family's influence might be factors where the husband could be seen as overreacting.\n\nBut the main issue is the breach of their agreement. If they agreed on secular upbringing, and the wife is allowing her family to influence the child against the husband's wishes, he's justified in feeling wronged. The father-in-law's actions without consent are problematic. So the husband's stance might be valid, making the answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
