She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their story again to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is married to his wife for two years. She's from an immigrant family that's fundamentalist Muslim. He's an atheist, and when they met, she was too, maybe agnostic. She put on a front for her father. Her family doesn't like him because he's white from a Christian background. They didn't attend the wedding. The couple agreed to raise their kids secular, with the option to choose Islam when older. Now they have a son, and the father found out the wife's father took the baby to the mosque without permission, dressed him in Muslim clothes. The author is upset because he feels the father-in-law is controlling his wife and wants to influence the son against his wishes. He told his wife he'd divorce her if she continues to allow this, even if it means splitting up.\n\nSo, the key points are: the couple agreed on secular upbringing, but the wife is being pressured by her family, and the father-in-law is acting against the author's wishes. The author is threatening divorce over this.\n\nNow, considering the situation, is the author in the wrong? Well, the wife agreed initially to the secular upbringing. However, maybe she's being influenced by her family. The author is protecting his son from what he sees as unwanted religious influence. On the other hand, the wife might be struggling between her family's expectations and her husband's wishes. The father-in-law's actions are definitely a problem, but the wife's role in allowing that is in question.\n\nThe author is taking a firm stance because he values the child's upbringing as secular. He's standing up for his beliefs. However, is threatening divorce the right approach? Maybe there's a communication issue. The wife might not be fully on board anymore, or she's conflicted. The author could be in the right in wanting to protect his son from unwanted influence, but his approach might be too harsh. Divorce over this might be extreme if there's potential for compromise. Alternatively, if the wife is not respecting the original agreement and is enabling her father's actions, then the author's stance is justified.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? The father-in-law's actions are unethical, but the wife might have a role in enabling that. The author is trying to assert his right as a parent. The law usually considers both parents' rights, but in some places, the father has equal say. However, if the wife is acting against the agreement, the author is within his rights to be upset. The problem is whether threatening divorce is justified. If the wife is not heeding his warnings and is actively undermining his wishes, maybe he's justified. But if there's a lack of communication or understanding, perhaps the approach could be better. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has a right to his beliefs. However, the ultimatum might be harsh. But given that the father-in-law is violating the agreement and the wife isn't stopping it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is probably B (No), because the author is trying to protect his son's upbringing as agreed. However, there might be nuances. The wife's autonomy is important too. If she's unhappy and being controlled by her family, the author should address that with her rather than just the religious aspect. But given the situation described, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
