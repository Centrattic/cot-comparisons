She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a non-religious person married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim immigrant family. They had agreed that their children would be raised secularly, but the wife's father has been taking their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge. The author threatens divorce if this continues, saying he won't let the father-in-law influence their son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents do have the right to decide how to raise their children, but when there's a conflict between parents, especially involving religious instruction, it can get complicated. The author is a father and has parental rights, so he's within his rights to express his wishes about his son's upbringing. However, the wife is also a parent and might have her own views influenced by her family and culture.\n\nThe wife initially agreed to raise the children secularly, but maybe her stance is shifting under family pressure. The author is frustrated because her father is going behind his back to expose the child to Islam, which he's against. He feels that the child is his too, and he doesn't want his son being influenced by religion without his consent.\n\nBut is threatening divorce the right approach? Divorce is a serious matter. The author could have tried other methods first, like counseling, setting boundaries with the in-laws, or legal steps if necessary. However, the situation has escalated because the father-in-law is ignoring the author's wishes. The author is standing up for his values and the child's upbringing, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be caught in the middle. She's an adult and should make her own decisions, but family pressure can be overwhelming. The author is taking a firm stance, which might be necessary to protect the child's upbringing, especially if the father-in-law is acting without consent. \n\nLegally, both parents have equal rights, but if one parent is acting alone to introduce religion without the other's consent, the other parent can take steps to prevent that. The author's threat of divorce is a last resort, but if the wife is not stopping the father's actions, maybe it's justified. \n\nEthically, it's about balancing parental rights and cultural values. The author isn't wrong in wanting to protect his son's upbringing as agreed. However, the method of threatening divorce might be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe it's a justified reaction to protect his child's future. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would depend on whether the author's actions are proportionate. Since the father-in-law is acting against the agreed-upon parenting plan and the author feels cornered, his stance might be understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
