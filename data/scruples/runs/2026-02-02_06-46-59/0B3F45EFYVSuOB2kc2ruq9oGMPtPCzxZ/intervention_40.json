She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife raising their son as Muslim, despite their prior agreement. The author is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly unless the kids choose Islam later. However, the wife's father is pressuring the family, and he took their son to the mosque without their consent.\n\nThe author argues that he's standing by the original agreement and won't let his son be raised Muslim, even if it means divorce. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's approach is justified. He made a clear agreement with his wife, and she agreed. The father-in-law's actions are interfering, which the author is trying to prevent. But the author is giving an ultimatum\u2014divorce if the wife continues to allow religious influence. However, the wife might feel caught between her family and her husband. She's an adult and might be trying to maintain her relationship with her family, but she's also a parent. \n\nThe key points are mutual consent in parenting decisions. The author and wife had an agreement, but the wife might be facing pressure from her family. The author's reaction is extreme\u2014threatening divorce over a breach of that agreement. However, the wife might not be the one directly allowing her father to take the baby; maybe she's resisting but her father is acting without her consent. The author might not have considered that the wife is also a victim here, caught between two pressures.\n\nThe author's statement about the wife being an adult who can do what she wants but he won't let the father-in-law influence the son. But if the wife is complying under pressure, maybe the author is overreacting. Also, threatening divorce immediately might be too harsh without trying other solutions first. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the author's response could be seen as inflexible. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife agreed to the secular upbringing and the father-in-law is violating that agreement, the author has a right to be concerned. However, the way he's handling it might be causing more harm. The wife's well-being is also a factor\u2014she's depressed after seeing her father. The author's approach might be pushing her further away from her family, which could have long-term consequences.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife is acting under pressure and not willingly, then the author might be overstepping. But if she's not upholding their agreement, he has a right to be upset. The immediate threat of divorce seems extreme. Maybe there's a middle ground where they address the father-in-law's actions without breaking up the family. The answer could be A (Yes, in the wrong) because threatening divorce over a disagreement in parenting might not consider the wife's position and could be seen as controlling. Alternatively, B (Not in the wrong) if he's protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement.\n"
