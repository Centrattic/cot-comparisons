She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given text is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with a newborn son, where the husband is an atheist and the wife was previously agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards raising their son as Muslim. The husband is threatening divorce if she continues, especially after her father took the child to the mosque without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had agreed that the children would be raised secularly. The wife's family is fundamentalist, and they don't approve of the husband. The father-in-law is pressuring the wife and directly acting against the husband's wishes by involving the son in religious activities. The husband is upset because he feels his authority as a parent is being undermined.\n\nNow, looking at the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in child-rearing unless a court decides otherwise. Since the wife is the mother, she has legal rights too, but she had agreed to the secular upbringing. However, her actions now are conflicting with that agreement. The father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's not the parent; he shouldn't be making decisions about the child's upbringing without parental consent.\n\nThe husband's main argument is about protecting his son from being raised in a way he disagrees with. He's also concerned about his wife's family's influence. He's stated his position clearly and is willing to leave if it continues. The wife might feel torn between her husband and her family, which is a common issue in intercultural or interfaith marriages.\n\nBut where is the line drawn? The husband is using a threat of divorce as a way to enforce his will. This could be seen as extreme. However, given that the father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes, perhaps he has a valid concern about his child's well-being. The wife's actions of allowing her father to take the child without consent might be the issue here. The husband is defending his parental rights.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's immediate threat to divorce could be seen as harsh. It's possible that he's not giving the wife enough credit for making independent decisions. If the wife is willingly allowing her father's influence, maybe the husband should address it through counseling or legal means first. But in this case, he's already communicated his stance multiple times, and the actions continue.\n\nCulturally, there's also the aspect of the wife's family pressuring her. If the wife is being controlled by her family, the husband is trying to protect her and their child. However, he's also making decisions about their child's upbringing, which is a matter of parental rights. The key is whether the wife is complicit in allowing her father's influence, which might mean she's not respecting the husband's wishes, or if she's being coerced.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the husband is standing up for his beliefs and his child's upbringing. However, using divorce as a threat without giving the wife a chance to resolve the issue could be problematic. It might be more constructive to seek mediation or legal advice before taking such drastic steps. But given the circumstances\u2014especially the father-in-law's actions\u2014it's understandable that the husband feels his boundaries are violated.\n\nLegally, the husband might have grounds if the father-in-law is interfering in child custody. The wife's role in allowing this is crucial. If she's enabling her father's actions, that could impact her standing in any legal battle. However, the husband's approach of immediate divorce without trying to resolve it through negotiation or counseling first could be seen as extreme.\n\nIn summary, the husband's actions are driven by protecting his child's upbringing and asserting his parental rights. However, the method of using divorce as a threat without exploring other options might be seen as harsh. The key factors are the wife's complicity and the father-in-law's illegal actions. If the wife is not respecting the agreed-upon secular upbringing and is allowing external family influence, the husband is justified in his stance. But the way he's handling it could be improved. So, while he might not be in the wrong, the approach could be better. However, given the context, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
