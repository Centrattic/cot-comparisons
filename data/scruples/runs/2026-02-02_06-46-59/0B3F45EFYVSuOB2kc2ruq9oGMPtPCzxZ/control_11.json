She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to expose their son to Muslim practices. The author is an atheist, his wife was agnostic when they married, but now she's being influenced by her fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed on a secular upbringing for their children. However, the father-in-law secretly took their son to a mosque without the author's consent.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' rights and the child's welfare. Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing, but there's a conflict here. The author is concerned about the father-in-law's influence and wants to prevent Islamic teachings from being imposed on the child. The wife might be conflicted between her husband's wishes and her family's pressure.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights unless a court rules otherwise. However, the father-in-law isn't a parent, so his actions without consent might be problematic. The author's threat to divorce if the wife continues to allow this could be seen as extreme, but it's also a matter of his firm stance on secular upbringing.\n\nThe wife's complicity is important. If she's actively enabling her father's actions despite her husband's objections, that's a problem. The author's position is that he can't allow his son to be raised in a way he opposes, even if it means splitting from his wife. This is a moral and ethical dilemma. \n\nCultural and religious differences are significant here. The wife's family disapproves of the husband, which adds tension. The author's firm stance is about his child's upbringing, which is a valid concern. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as harsh, but it's his way of asserting his rights as a father.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong: he's standing up for his beliefs and his child's upbringing. However, the approach could be seen as ultimatum-like. But given the circumstances, especially the unauthorized actions of the father-in-law and the wife's continued cooperation, the author's position isn't without merit. The line between respecting the wife's autonomy and protecting the child's upbringing is a delicate one. The author's actions seem to be in the child's best interest, even if it leads to the marriage's end. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
