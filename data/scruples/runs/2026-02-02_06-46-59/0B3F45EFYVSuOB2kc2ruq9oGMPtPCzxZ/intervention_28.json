She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for threatening divorce if his wife continues to raise their son as Muslim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user (AITA) is an atheist, his wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their kids secularly, with the kids choosing religion later. Now, the wife's family is pushing her to raise the son as Muslim. The father-in-law took the baby to the mosque without permission. The author is upset because he doesn't want his son raised Muslim and is considering divorce if the wife continues this.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreement between the couple about child-rearing, the father-in-law's actions, and the author's response. The author is threatening divorce over the religious upbringing, which is a major decision.\n\nI should consider the legal and cultural aspects. In many places, both parents have equal say in their child's upbringing unless there's a court decision. However, the wife might be influenced by her family, which complicates things. The author is taking a firm stance because he doesn't want his son raised in a religion he rejects. But threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is acting under pressure from her family.\n\nThe wife's side: She might feel torn between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. If she's an adult and capable of making decisions, she might be struggling with her identity and autonomy. The father-in-law's actions are problematic because he took the child without permission, which is a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's position is about protecting his son's upbringing as per their agreement. However, threatening divorce is a significant step. It's possible that the author is justified in wanting to enforce their agreement but might be handling it in a way that doesn't leave room for compromise. The wife might need support to stand up to her family without leading to divorce.\n\nAlso, considering the wife's happiness\u2014she's happy at home but depressed when with her father. The author might be right to be concerned about her well-being and the child's. But the approach of divorce as a threat could be seen as inflexible, especially if the wife is trying to navigate her family's influence.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, both parents have rights, but decisions about religious upbringing can be contentious. The author might have legal grounds to contest if the other party is forcing religion on the child, but the threat of divorce for this reason might depend on the specific circumstances and the court's view.\n\nEthically, it's a matter of personal beliefs and the right to raise children according to one's values. The author is standing by his secular views, but the wife's actions might be seen as influenced by her family rather than her own choice. If she's complicit in the religious upbringing, then the author's stance makes sense. But if she's being coerced, then the author might need to support her rather than threaten divorce.\n\nIn summary, the author's position is based on protecting his child's upbringing according to their agreement. However, threatening divorce is a drastic measure. There might be a need for mediation or legal intervention rather than immediate divorce. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his actions are proportionate and if there's room for negotiation. If the wife is not actively opposing her family's actions but is being pressured, the author's threat might be seen as overly harsh. Alternatively, if he's protecting their agreed-upon parenting plan, he has a valid point. The answer could be nuanced, but given the options (A or B), it's a judgment call between the two.\n"
