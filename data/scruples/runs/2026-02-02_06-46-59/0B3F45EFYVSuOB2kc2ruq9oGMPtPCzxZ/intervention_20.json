She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is a man who married a Muslim woman from an immigrant background. He's an atheist, and they agreed that their children would be raised secular. The wife came from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and even though she was agnostic when they met, she's now being pressured by her family, especially her father, to raise their son as Muslim. The father-in-law even took the baby to the mosque without permission, dressing him in Muslim clothes. The husband now threatens divorce if his wife continues to let her family influence their son's upbringing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple had a mutual agreement about raising their children secularly. The wife agreed to that, but her family is pressuring her. The father-in-law's actions are a direct violation of the husband's wishes. The husband is standing his ground because he's committed to secular upbringing. However, he's threatening divorce if his wife doesn't comply, which is a big deal.\n\nThe wife's family is causing her distress, making her depressed and ashamed when she interacts with them. The husband is trying to protect his son from religious indoctrination by her father. But is the husband being overbearing? He's enforcing his views even though his wife is an adult and might have her own feelings about her cultural identity. However, since they had a prior agreement, maybe his stance is justified.\n\nBut maybe the wife is also in a tough spot. She might feel torn between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. If she's not forced to comply with her family's demands, but the father-in-law is acting independently, then the husband's concern is valid. However, threatening divorce is a heavy measure. The husband's right to raise his child as he wants versus the wife's autonomy and cultural ties.\n\nIn family law, parents usually share equal rights in child-rearing. If the wife is supporting her father's actions, then the husband has a right to object. But if the wife is also trying to maintain her cultural heritage without forcing the religion on the child, there's a middle ground. The husband's threat of divorce seems extreme, but maybe not entirely in the wrong since he's standing up for his agreed-upon values. However, the way he's handling it without considering his wife's perspective might be an issue.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions are problematic. But the husband's response is about protecting his son's upbringing. So, the question is whether the husband is overstepping by threatening divorce. If the wife is not in agreement with her father's actions and is complying under pressure, then the husband's stance is reasonable. But if the wife is also complicit in allowing her father to influence the child, then the husband is justified in his actions.\n\nI think the key points are the prior agreement, the father-in-law's unauthorized actions, and the husband's right to enforce the upbringing terms he agreed upon. The husband isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his child's upbringing based on mutual agreement. However, the way he handles the marital relationship might be an issue, but the core issue of the child's upbringing is his right as a parent. So the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
