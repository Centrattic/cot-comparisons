She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce their wife over religious differences regarding their son's upbringing. \n\nFirst, the author is an atheist, the wife was originally agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam. They had agreed before having kids that the children would be raised secular. The father's in-laws are fundamentalist Muslims who don't accept the husband because he's white and from a Christian background. The wife's father took the baby to the mosque without permission, which the husband found out later.\n\nThe key points here are the prior agreement, the breach of that agreement, and the father's actions in taking the child. The husband feels that the father-in-law is exerting undue influence. He's standing by his initial agreement and is now threatening divorce because the wife is allowing her father to influence the child against their earlier understanding.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The wife might be in a tough spot, pressured by her family. But the husband's stance is about respecting their initial agreement and protecting his son's upbringing. Legally, in many places, both parents have equal say in a child's upbringing unless there's a custody issue. However, this is more about their personal agreement. The husband is asserting his right to not have his son raised in a religion he doesn't agree with, especially against the agreement they made. \n\nThe wife might feel torn between her family and her husband. But the husband's position is that he can't accept the breach of their agreement. The fact that the father-in-law is ignoring him adds to the problem. The husband's threat to divorce is a serious move, but he's standing by his principles. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he made his stance clear before having children. Now that the agreement is being broken, he's taking a firm position. While the wife may be under pressure, the husband is acting according to their prior understanding. So, the answer would lean towards B, he's not in the wrong because he's upholding the agreement and protecting his child's upbringing as per their mutual understanding.\n"
