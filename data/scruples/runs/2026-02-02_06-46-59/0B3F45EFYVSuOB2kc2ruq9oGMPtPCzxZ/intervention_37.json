She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a couple with different religious beliefs. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed their kids would be raised secular. Now the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, are pressuring them, and the father-in-law took their son to the mosque without permission.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. They want a simple answer, A or B, where A is yes (author wrong) and B is no (author not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement before having children. The wife's father is acting against the husband's wishes, which is a problem. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this. \n\nThe main issue is parental rights and the enforcement of the agreement. The husband is standing by the original agreement, but the wife might feel pressured by her family. However, the father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which the husband has a right to object to. \n\nBut is the husband's threat of divorce justified? Maybe the wife is also being influenced by her family against her will. The husband is being protective of his son's upbringing. However, the way he's handling it by threatening divorce might be harsh. He should have tried other methods first, like counseling or legal steps. \n\nAlso, the wife's autonomy is a factor. The husband says she's an adult and can do what she wants, but he's still upset she's allowing family to interfere. There's a conflict between the couple's agreement and the wife's family's actions. \n\nThe husband's actions (threatening divorce) are extreme, but his stance on raising the child secular is based on their prior agreement. The problem is whether the wife is complying with the father's actions against her will or not. If she is, then the husband has a right to be upset. If she's not, maybe the father-in-law is acting independently. \n\nThe husband's refusal to let the father-in-law influence their son is about protecting the child's upbringing, which is a valid concern. However, the approach of threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances, maybe he's justified in standing his ground. \n\nIn terms of the law, parents have joint custody unless otherwise decided. The husband's objection to the father-in-law taking the child without permission is valid. However, making divorce conditional on this might be too severe. There's a balance between protecting the child's interests and maintaining the marriage. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because he's enforcing their agreement and protecting his child's upbringing. However, the method of using divorce as a threat could be seen as harsh. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author is protecting his agreed-upon rights as a parent, then he's not wrong. The father-in-law's actions are the problem, not the author's response to them.\n"
