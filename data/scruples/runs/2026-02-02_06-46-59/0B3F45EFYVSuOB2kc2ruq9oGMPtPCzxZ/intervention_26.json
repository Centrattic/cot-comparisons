She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a child where there's a conflict over religious upbringing. The husband is an atheist, the wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. The wife's family is pressuring them, and the father-in-law took their son to the mosque without consent. The husband threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The father-in-law's actions breach that agreement. The husband is upset because the son is being exposed to religion against his wishes. The wife might feel torn between her family's expectations and her agreement with her husband.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The argument could be that the husband is overreacting by threatening divorce. However, the wife's actions (allowing her father to take the child) might be seen as violating their agreement. But maybe the wife is under pressure from her family, which complicates her position.\n\nLegal aspects vary by country. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising the child. However, if one parent is acting against the other's wishes without mutual agreement, there might be legal concerns. The husband's refusal to let the father-in-law interact with the child could be seen as protecting his religious views, but threatening divorce over this might be extreme.\n\nEmotionally, the situation is tense. The wife might feel caught between her husband and her family. The husband is trying to enforce their initial agreement. The father-in-law's actions are unauthorized, which is a breach of trust. The husband's reaction is based on keeping the child secular, which he had agreed upon with the wife before the child was born.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The husband is using a threat of divorce to control his wife's choices. But the wife's agreement to secular upbringing might imply she had control over her family's influence. If she's allowing her father to do this, maybe she's not upholding her part of the agreement. However, maybe she's under pressure and needs support from her husband to resist her family.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband is asserting his right to co-parent without interference. The father-in-law's actions are problematic. The husband's reaction is about enforcing their agreement, even if it's extreme. The wife's compliance with her father might be a breach, but perhaps she's struggling with her family's influence.\n\nAlternatively, the husband could be in the wrong if he's using divorce as a threat without trying to resolve the issue through other means. But given the breach of agreement, maybe not. The situation is complex, but the husband's stance is based on their prior agreement and protecting his son's upbringing. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, the threat of divorce over this might be too harsh. But given the circumstances, it's a matter of perspective.\n"
