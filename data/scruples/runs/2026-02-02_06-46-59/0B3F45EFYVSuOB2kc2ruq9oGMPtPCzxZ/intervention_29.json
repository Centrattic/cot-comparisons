She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with different religious beliefs. The husband is an atheist, and the wife used to be too but now the father-in-law is pressuring her to raise their son as Muslim. The husband is threatening divorce if she continues, because he doesn't want the kid raised in that religion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife agreed to raise the kids secularly, but her family is influencing her. The father-in-law is taking the baby to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. This seems like a breach of the couple's agreement. The husband feels that the kid is being exposed to religion against his wishes, which is a valid concern because both parents usually have a say in their child's upbringing.\n\nBut wait, the wife is still an adult. She's in a relationship where they both had an agreement. However, her family's pressure might be making her feel conflicted. The husband is upset because she's going against their agreement, but maybe she's under stress from her family. The husband's response is pretty strong\u2014threatening divorce over this. Is that too harsh?\n\nIn co-parenting, especially when there are differing religious beliefs, communication is key. The husband could have tried to address the issue with his wife first, rather than immediately threatening divorce. But the father-in-law is actively going against the husband's wishes by taking the baby without permission. That's a problem. The husband has a right to be concerned about his child's upbringing. However, using divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme, even if the issue is serious.\n\nBut if the agreement was that the child would be raised secularly and the wife is allowing or enabling her father's actions, the husband isn't wrong in standing by his original stance. He did agree to not have kids otherwise, so he's trying to hold the line. However, the method of confrontation\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as harsh. It's possible that the wife is also struggling with her family's expectations and might need support rather than ultimatums.\n\nBut the father-in-law's actions are a direct violation of the couple's agreement. The husband might be justified in taking a firm stance here. The wife's mental health is also a factor\u2014she feels depressed after seeing her father, which suggests the father is using manipulative tactics. The husband's concern about his son's upbringing is valid, and he's trying to protect his child's autonomy. \n\nIn many places, both parents have equal rights to influence the child's upbringing, so the husband's stance is not without merit. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as extreme. But if the wife is also not standing up to her family, maybe the husband is right to enforce the agreement. This is a bit of a tough call. The answer might depend on the specific cultural context and the laws in their area regarding child custody and religious upbringing. But assuming that both parents have a right to their beliefs and the agreement was mutual, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The wife might need to take a firmer stand against her family, and the husband is just trying to uphold their original agreement. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances.\n"
