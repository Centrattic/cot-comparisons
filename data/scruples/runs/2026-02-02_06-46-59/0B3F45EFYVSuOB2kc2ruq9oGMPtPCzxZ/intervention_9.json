She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed that their kids would be raised secularly, but now the father-in-law is taking their son to the mosque without their knowledge. The author is threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, but both parents should ideally agree. The author and his wife had an agreement beforehand, so there's a breach when the wife isn't following through. However, the father-in-law's actions might be a point of contention. The author is upset because his father-in-law is taking the child without permission, which could be a legal issue if the father-in-law isn't the legal guardian. \n\nThen there's the dynamic between the couple. The wife might be under pressure from her family, which could explain why she's not stopping the father-in-law. The author is frustrated because he feels his wishes are being ignored, and he's making a ultimatum about divorce. But is threatening divorce over this issue justified? It's a major decision, and maybe there are other ways to resolve the conflict first, like family counseling or legal interventions to prevent the father-in-law from taking the child without permission.\n\nAlso, the author's perspective seems to be that he's the one standing up for his beliefs and protecting his son, but does that give him the right to threaten divorce over his wife's actions, especially if she's being pressured by her family? The wife might feel caught between her family and her husband. The author might be overreacting by making such a strong ultimatum without trying to address the issue more collaboratively.\n\nOn the other hand, the father-in-law's actions are unauthorized. If the child is being taken without the father's consent, that's a problem. The author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing. However, threatening divorce because the wife isn't stopping her father might be seen as holding her responsible for her family's actions, which isn't entirely fair. The wife might not have control over her father's actions, especially if she's being pressured by her family.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over this issue. He should address the father-in-law's actions through legal means or other strategies before making such a drastic decision. However, if the wife is actively enabling her father's actions despite agreeing to the secular upbringing, that's a different matter. The key here is whether the wife is violating their agreement by not enforcing her father's behavior. If she is, then maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But threatening divorce immediately seems extreme. There might be a middle ground where both parties could work out a solution without breaking up the marriage.\n"
