She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a couple with different religious beliefs. The husband is an atheist, and the wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The husband is raising the question of the wife breaking their agreement. He feels that the father-in-law is exerting control over his son, which he's not okay with. He's even said he might divorce her if she continues this. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI should analyze the dynamics. The couple had a prenuptial agreement about child-rearing, so the husband's stance is based on that. However, the wife might be under pressure from her family and possibly feels conflicted. The father-in-law's actions are against the husband's wishes, which is a problem. The husband's anger could be justified because he's a parent and feels his input is being disregarded.\n\nBut then, is the husband being too harsh? The wife is an adult and might be making her own choices, even if influenced by family. The husband's threat of divorce is a serious consequence. Raising children is a big responsibility, and both parents have a right to their beliefs. However, the wife's father is directly involved without the husband's consent, which might be a breach of the couple's agreement.\n\nAnother angle: the wife might be trying to maintain her cultural identity or family relationships. The husband's reaction should consider her feelings and the reason why she's allowing her father to do this. Is there communication breakdown? The husband says he's told her many times, but maybe she's not in a position to resist her family's pressure immediately. \n\nThe father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's imposing his religion on the child without the other parent's consent. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising the child, so that's a legal aspect too. But the husband's approach of threatening divorce might be extreme. It's possible he's right about the principle (no unilateral religious upbringing) but wrong in the method (threatening divorce over this issue without trying to resolve it together).\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the threat of divorce is justified. If the parents agreed secular upbringing, then the wife's actions (if she's enabling her father to influence the child) could be seen as a breach. However, the husband's way of handling it\u2014divorce as a response\u2014might be the wrong approach. Maybe there's a better way to address the issue with the wife, not just her father. The wife might be in a tough spot, so the husband's support or understanding could be important. \n\nBut the question is about the author (the husband) being in the wrong. If the father-in-law is acting without consent, the husband's anger is understandable. However, the ultimatum of divorce could be seen as extreme. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the husband is standing up for his beliefs regarding his child's upbringing. Yet, there's a need to consider the wife's perspective and how the ultimatum affects their marriage. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) if the approach is too harsh without considering the wife's position and possible reasons behind her actions.\n\nI'm a bit torn. The husband's right to have a say in his child's upbringing is valid, but the way he's enforcing it might be the issue. The wife might be caught between her family and her spouse. The husband could be overreacting by threatening divorce, but the father-in-law's actions are definitely a problem. The main conflict is between the parents and the father-in-law's interference. The husband's stance is about protecting his child, but the method of response might not be the best. So maybe the husband is not in the wrong (B) for wanting to protect his son, but his approach could use some adjustment. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his method is the best. \n\nAlso, the wife agreed to the secular upbringing when they married. The father-in-law isn't the one raising the child; the wife's complicity in allowing her father to influence the child might be an issue. The husband's point about the son being his too and being a baby is significant. The father-in-law shouldn't have that control. So the husband is right in principle but maybe wrong in the way he's handling it. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the father-in-law is acting against his wishes, then the husband isn't wrong for objecting. The threat of divorce is a strong step, but the core issue is valid. So perhaps the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
