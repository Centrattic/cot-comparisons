She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over religious upbringing issues.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife had an agreement to raise their child secularly. The wife initially agreed, but now her family is influencing the child. The father in law took the son to the mosque without permission. The husband feels the child is being raised against his wishes and threatens divorce.\n\nKey points: The father's main issue is about control over his child's religious upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she might be influenced by them. The husband wants to prevent religious indoctrination. \n\nBut the wife is an adult and the mother. The husband is making a claim about her father's actions, but technically, the wife's choices are her own. If she's choosing to let her father interact with the child in a way the husband disagrees with, is that her right? Or is the father overstepping by threatening divorce?\n\nThe husband's position is that he agreed to the marriage and children under secular terms. If she's not upholding that agreement by allowing her father's influence, maybe he's justified. But he's accusing her of breaking the agreement, but she might still be making her own choices. \n\nThe husband's threat is about divorce over this. That's a serious consequence. If the wife is making her own decisions as an adult, even if they contradict the initial agreement, maybe the husband shouldn't use divorce as a threat. Unless she's violating their legal rights or the child's welfare is at risk.\n\nBut the father in law's actions are problematic. The husband is protecting his son from what he sees as unwanted religious influence. However, the wife's agency is a factor. If she's allowing her father to influence the child, perhaps the husband shouldn't control her choices. \n\nAlso, the husband's approach might be seen as controlling. Insisting on divorce if she continues to allow her father's involvement could be seen as undermining her autonomy. Unless there's a legal agreement in place, the husband's authority over the child's upbringing is shared with the wife. \n\nSo, if the wife is making decisions about the child's upbringing, the husband can discuss it with her but can't unilaterally decide. Threatening divorce over this might be inconsiderate of her autonomy. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong.\n"
