She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist who married a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly, but now the wife's father has been taking their son to the mosque without the author's consent, which the author sees as religious indoctrination. The author threatens divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement before having kids. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's being manipulated or controlled by her father. The author is upset that the father is influencing their son against the agreed-upon secular upbringing. The author is standing by his agreement and feels that the son is his too, so he has the right to object.\n\nNow, thinking about parenting rights and responsibilities. Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. If there was a mutual agreement, then it's a shared decision. The wife's father acting without consent is a problem, but the wife herself might be complicit if she's allowing it. The author is upset because the wife is not stopping her father, which breaches their agreement.\n\nBut is the author wrong for threatening divorce? Well, if the wife is going against the initial agreement, then the author is within his rights to express that he can't go along with it. However, threatening divorce over a disagreement might be seen as extreme. But given the importance of the child's upbringing, it's a significant issue. The father is also acting unilaterally, which is problematic.\n\nThe wife might be caught between her family and her husband. The author's concern is about the child's religious upbringing, which is a major issue. The fact that the father-in-law is controlling and the wife is under pressure adds to the complexity. The author is protecting his son from what he sees as unwanted influence. So while the threat of divorce is serious, if the wife is not respecting the agreed-upon parenting plan, then the author's stance could be justified. However, communication and seeking resolution through other means might be necessary before taking such a drastic step. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife is indeed violating their agreement, then he's not in the wrong for taking a stand. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
