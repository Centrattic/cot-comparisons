She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over religious upbringing of their son. The wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family, and the author is an atheist. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. The wife's father took their son to the mosque without permission, which the author is upset about.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is about the religious upbringing of their child. He values secularism and doesn't want the son exposed to Islam against their agreement. The wife, however, might feel pressure from her family and perhaps her own changing beliefs. She might be trying to honor her family's expectations or struggling with her own identity.\n\nThe author's response is to threaten divorce if she continues. That's a serious ultimatum. It's important to consider communication. Have they discussed this? The author mentions he's told her many times, but she still brings the son to her father. Maybe there's a lack of resolution or compromise.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions are a problem. The author can't control him directly, but he can enforce boundaries with his wife. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is under pressure from her family and might feel trapped between her husband and her father.\n\nThe wife's mental health is mentioned\u2014she's depressed and ashamed. The author says he loves her but also states she can do as she wants. That seems contradictory. If she's making choices against their agreement, it might be a conflict of priorities. The author is concerned about his son's upbringing, which is valid, but the method of using divorce as a threat might not address the underlying issues.\n\nLegal aspects could vary, but the question is about moral wrong. If the author's actions are to protect his child's upbringing, he's not in the wrong. But the ultimatum might be seen as extreme. The wife might need support to resist her family's pressure, not just threats. Maybe counseling could help. The author's stance is about respect for his beliefs and his role as a parent. However, the way he handles it could be problematic if it's not allowing space for the wife's autonomy or if it's causing her more stress.\n\nIn summary, the author has valid concerns about his child's upbringing, but the approach might be too harsh. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are proportionate. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering the context and the wife's possible struggles, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his parental rights, but the method could be debated. However, the line is thin between standing by one's beliefs and being inconsiderate of the wife's position. Alternatively, if the wife is making choices against their agreement, the author is justified. Hmm.\n"
