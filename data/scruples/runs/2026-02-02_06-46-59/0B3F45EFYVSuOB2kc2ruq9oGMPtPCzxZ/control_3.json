She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the husband is an atheist and the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father started taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife had an agreement about their children's upbringing. The husband is upset because the father-in-law is influencing the son against his wishes. The husband even threatened divorce if this continues. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. Well, from a legal and ethical standpoint, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, but there's also a mutual responsibility. The husband is standing up for his beliefs and the agreement they had. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme. \n\nWait, the wife might be caught between her family's expectations and her personal choice. The user mentions that the wife was agnostic when they met but maybe is now being influenced by her family. The husband's main issue is that the father-in-law is acting against his wishes, even though the wife agreed initially. \n\nBut is threatening divorce the right approach? It's a serious matter. The husband is protecting his child's upbringing, which is his right. However, the way he's handling it (threatening divorce) could be problematic. But maybe in this case, it's justified because it's about the child's religious upbringing, which is a fundamental issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have tried other means to resolve the issue with the wife first, like counseling, before threatening divorce. But the wife might not be acting against the agreement either, as she's under family pressure. \n\nI think the key here is whether the husband is enforcing the agreement they had, but using a harsh method. However, given the importance of a child's upbringing, his stance might be seen as justified. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any cultural or legal factors I'm missing. In many places, both parents have equal rights, so the husband is within his rights to object. The wife might need to take a stronger stand against her family's interference. So the husband's threat isn't necessarily wrong, even if the method is harsh. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
