She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, an atheist, and his wife, who is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed their child would be raised secularly. However, the wife's father is pressuring her to take their son to the mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes without the author's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. The author is the father, so his objections about how the child is being raised are valid. However, the wife is also a parent and an adult, so she has her own agency. The father-in-law's actions without the author's consent could be problematic, especially if he's influencing the child's upbringing against the other parent's wishes.\n\nThe author mentions that he and his wife had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's actions, perhaps influenced by her family, are going against that agreement. The author's response is to threaten divorce if this continues. The key points here are the breach of agreement, the father-in-law's interference, and the author's ultimatum.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be involved in his child's upbringing and to express his wishes. On the other hand, threatening divorce over religious upbringing could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is also a parent. However, the father-in-law's actions without consent and the breach of the prior agreement might justify the author's stance.\n\nIt's also important to consider the wife's perspective. She might feel torn between her husband and her family. The author's approach of ultimatum might not be the healthiest way to resolve the conflict, but given the circumstances, it's a reaction to a breach of trust and agreement.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's enforcing the agreement they had, he's in the right. But if his threat of divorce is too harsh without considering his wife's autonomy, maybe he's partly at fault. However, the father-in-law's actions are clearly problematic. The author's main issue is with the unauthorized influence on his child, which he has a right to object to. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
