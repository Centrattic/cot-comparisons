She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The author is an atheist, married to a wife from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secular. But the wife's family is pressuring them, and the father-in-law took the son to the mosque without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her agreement with her husband. The father-in-law's actions are a big issue here. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let this happen. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the ethical aspects. The father is concerned about his child's upbringing, which is a valid concern. However, threatening divorce over this might be extreme. But the context is important: the wife agreed to the secular agreement, so if she's going against it, maybe the author has a point. \n\nBut is the author handling it the right way? Telling someone you'll divorce them if they don't comply with your wishes is a serious matter. Maybe there's a need for communication and mediation instead of an ultimatum. However, the father-in-law's actions are also a problem, and the wife might not be standing up to her family enough. \n\nThe wife's mental health is mentioned\u2014she becomes depressed after seeing her father. That's a red flag. The author might be acting out of frustration and a desire to protect his son. But threatening divorce is a major step. \n\nI should consider cultural factors. The wife's family might have strong cultural expectations. The author's background is different. It's possible that the wife is under pressure from her family, which could affect her decisions. If she's not enforcing the agreement, maybe the author is justified in his stance. \n\nBut is the author wrong for threatening divorce? It's a personal decision, but perhaps there's a middle ground. Maybe counseling or setting boundaries would be better. However, the father-in-law's actions are against the agreed-upon parenting plan. The author's main issue is about the child's upbringing, which is a critical aspect. \n\nIn terms of legal rights, in many places, both parents have equal rights in child custody. The father-in-law shouldn't have that much control. The author is trying to protect his son's upbringing. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreement. On the other hand, using divorce as a threat could be seen as extreme. However, given the circumstances of the wife's family overstepping and the violation of their agreement, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. The key is whether the wife is complicit or not. If she's not preventing her father from taking the child, maybe the author's frustration is valid. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to protect his child's upbringing as agreed and is dealing with a difficult family situation. The threat of divorce is harsh, but the context of the father-in-law's actions and the broken agreement might justify his stance.\n"
