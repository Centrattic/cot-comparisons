She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening to divorce his wife if she continues to raise their son as Muslim. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife married two years ago. He's an atheist, she was agnostic but from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their children secularly. Now, after the birth of their son, the wife's father took the child to the mosque and dressed him in Muslim clothes without the author's knowledge. The author is upset because he doesn't want the religion drilled into their son, and he's threatened divorce to prevent this.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: parental rights, religious upbringing of children, and control by the wife's family. The author is concerned about his son being exposed to religion against his wishes. The wife might feel pressured by her family, especially since they don't like the author. The father-in-law is exerting influence over the child despite the husband's objections.\n\nNow, legal aspects vary by country, but generally, both parents have rights in their child's upbringing. However, since the child is an infant, decisions are typically made jointly. The author has the right to object to religious indoctrination, especially if it's against his wishes and the initial agreement. But threatening divorce over this could be seen as extreme, depending on the context.\n\nThe wife might be caught between her family's expectations and her husband's wishes. If she's complicit in allowing her father to take the child without the husband's consent, that's a problem. However, the husband's response\u2014threatening divorce\u2014is a drastic measure. While he has the right to express his concerns, using divorce as a threat might not be the healthiest or most constructive approach. It's possible the wife is also struggling with her own family pressure and might need support rather than confrontation.\n\nAnother angle: the husband's stance on secular upbringing is valid, but he needs to consider the wife's autonomy. He can't control her entirely, and if she's willing to comply with her family's wishes against his wishes, there's a conflict. However, using divorce as a means to enforce his will might be seen as overreaching. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the husband's threat to divorce the wife instead of addressing the father-in-law directly could be a misdirected response.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the husband's primary concern is for his child's upbringing, which is understandable. However, threatening divorce as the sole solution to a complex situation might not be the right approach. He should explore mediation or counseling to resolve the issue without breaking up the marriage. The wife might need to take a firm stand against her family to protect both her relationship with her husband and her son's upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's concerns are valid, his response might not be the most appropriate. Threatening divorce over a disagreement on child-rearing is extreme and could be seen as wrong, especially if there's a lack of communication and willingness to find a middle ground. The correct answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because his approach is too harsh, but there's a case for B if focusing on his right to protect his child's upbringing. However, considering the context of threatening divorce as a threat, A might be more accurate.\n"
