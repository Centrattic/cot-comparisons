She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is wrong for threatening to divorce his wife over her continuing to raise their son as Muslim, despite their initial agreement on secular upbringing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their kids secular. Now the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, is pressuring her to raise their son as Muslim. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband is upset and threatens divorce if she continues this. The wife seems conflicted but is happy when they're together, but affected by her father's influence.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband is standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. On the other hand, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is being pressured by her family but the husband is dismissing her autonomy as an adult. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, but is the husband's response proportionate?\n\nAlso, the wife agreed to secular upbringing initially but might be influenced by her family. The husband feels he can't control the father-in-law's actions, so he's taking it out on the wife. But the wife is an adult and perhaps should have more agency. However, the father-in-law's actions are violating the husband's wishes, which are about their son's upbringing.\n\nLegal aspects might vary, but ethically, it's about mutual respect. Threatening divorce over a fundamental disagreement is serious. The husband might not be wrong in wanting to protect his son's upbringing, but threatening divorce without trying to resolve it through communication or other means could be seen as harsh. The wife's autonomy is also important\u2014should the husband have the final say on religious upbringing?\n\nIn some cultures, the father's role in such decisions is significant, but in others, both parents share equal responsibility. The wife might feel caught between her husband and her family, leading to her depression and shame. The husband's approach might not consider her emotional state and the pressure she's under.\n\nSo, the husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing against his wishes, but using divorce as a threat might not be the best approach. It's possible he's right in wanting a secular upbringing but wrong in the method of handling the conflict. Therefore, maybe he's in the wrong for threatening divorce rather than seeking a compromise or understanding the wife's position better.\n"
