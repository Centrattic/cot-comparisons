She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and a conflict over how their son is being raised.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist who initially found common ground with his wife, who was also agnostic. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. However, after their son was born, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, started pressuring them to involve the child in their religion. The wife's father took the son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, which led the author to threaten divorce if this continued.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal say in their child's upbringing unless a court decides otherwise. The author's wife is an adult, so she has her own agency. However, the father is asserting his right to prevent religious indoctrination. The mother might feel conflicted between her husband and her family. \n\nThe author's approach of threatening divorce seems extreme. While it's valid to want to protect one's child from unwanted religious influence, the method of using an ultimatum without attempting mediation or other solutions could be seen as harsh. The wife's actions might be influenced by family pressure, but the father's response of divorce could leave her in a difficult position, especially since the child is involved.\n\nThere's also the issue of grandparent rights. If the father-in-law is taking the child without consent, there might be legal recourse. However, the author's immediate threat to leave might not address the root issues of communication and compromise between the couple.\n\nIt's possible that the author's stance is about protecting the child's interests, but the way it's handled could be too confrontational. The wife might need support to resist her family's pressure rather than facing a divorce threat. The author's position could be seen as valid in intent but flawed in execution. Alternatively, some might argue that he's justified in wanting to prevent religious imposition on his child.\n\nConsidering all angles, the key points are: mutual agreement initially, breach of that agreement, and the response taken. The author's actions might be in the wrong because of the ultimatum and not addressing the situation through collaboration or legal means first. However, others might side with him on protecting the child's upbringing. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards A.\n"
