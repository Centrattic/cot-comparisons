She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with differing religious views and disagreements over raising their son. The husband is an atheist, the wife was previously agnostic but now seems to be influenced by her fundamentalist Muslim family. The father is upset because his son was taken to a mosque without his knowledge and wants to prevent the child from being raised Muslim. The wife had agreed to raise the children secularly but now seems to be wavering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children. If the father is a legal guardian, he has the right to object to the child being raised in a certain religion without his consent. However, the wife might also have her own religious beliefs that she wants to practice. The key issue here is the father's ultimatum to divorce his wife if she continues to raise the son as Muslim, which is a significant and controlling statement.\n\nThe father's actions might be seen as overstepping if he's making a decision that affects the child's upbringing without considering the mother's wishes, especially since she is the other parent. However, the father's concern is valid about his son being exposed to religion without his consent. The father-in-law's actions of taking the child without permission are problematic as well.\n\nThe wife's situation is complex. She's caught between her husband and her family. The father-in-law's influence is a factor here, but the wife's own choices matter. If she agreed to raise the child secularly but is now allowing her father to influence the son, that could be a breach of their agreement. However, the father's threat to divorce over this issue might be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is still within her rights to make religious choices for the child unless there's a legal agreement against it.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, neither parent can prevent the other from exposing the child to their religion unless there's a court order. But since the father is objecting to the child being raised in the mother's religion, it's a conflict of parental rights. The father's ultimatum is a serious decision that could affect the child's life significantly. However, the father has the right to his own beliefs and wants to protect his child from religion, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nThe father's reaction might be in the wrong if he's not considering the mother's autonomy and the possibility of compromise. However, the father is also protecting his child's upbringing as per his own beliefs. It's a tough balance. The fact that the father-in-law is acting without consent adds another layer of complexity. The father is justified in being upset about that, but threatening divorce over the mother's actions might be too harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father has valid concerns about his son's upbringing, making the threat of divorce over this issue could be seen as the wrong approach, especially if it's not giving the wife space to resolve the conflict with her family. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the ultimatum, but there's a strong argument for both sides. However, since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
