She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with conflicting beliefs about raising their child. The husband is an atheist and wants their son to be raised secular, while the wife, from a fundamentalist Muslim family, is now being pressured by her father to involve the child in Muslim practices. The husband found out her father took the baby to the mosque without permission, and he's threatening divorce if the wife continues to follow through.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement before having kids to raise them secular. The wife initially agreed, but now her family is influencing her, and she's allowing her father to interact with the child in ways the husband objects to. The father-in-law is disregarding the husband's wishes, and the wife is struggling between her family's expectations and her own relationship with her husband.\n\nNow, thinking about parental rights and responsibilities. Both parents have a say in their child's upbringing. The husband is concerned about the child being exposed to religious practices without his consent. The wife may feel torn between her family and her marriage. The husband's response is to threaten divorce, which is a significant consequence. Is that justified?\n\nThe wife's actions: she agreed to the secular upbringing but then allowed her father to take the child to the mosque. This might be a breach of their agreement. However, maybe the wife is under pressure from her family and is trying to navigate her own identity and happiness. The husband's ultimatum could be seen as extreme if the wife isn't outright defying their agreement. Or maybe it's a valid stand to protect his child's upbringing as per their prior agreement.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions are problematic as he's taking the child without the husband's consent. The husband has the right to be involved in such decisions. However, the wife's role here is crucial. Did she know about her father's actions? If she allowed it, that's an issue. But if she was unaware, it's a different scenario. The post says the father took the son \"without my knowledge,\" implying the wife might have been involved or at least not stopped it.\n\nThe husband's stance that the child is \"his too\" and that he won't let his father-in-law influence the upbringing is reasonable, given the prior agreement. But threatening divorce over this is a major step. The wife's autonomy as an adult is mentioned, but the couple's shared responsibility in parenting is key here. If the wife is going against the agreement, the husband is within his rights to express his concerns and set boundaries. However, the tone of the post suggests the husband is taking a very firm, possibly inconsiderate stance, not allowing room for compromise or understanding the wife's position.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's mental health\u2014she comes back depressed after seeing her father. The husband might not be considering the emotional toll this is taking on her, which could complicate their relationship. The husband's focus is on protecting the child's upbringing, but his approach might be dismissive of the wife's needs and the pressure she's under.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife broke their agreement, then the husband is justified in his stance. However, threatening divorce without trying to resolve the issue through communication or compromise could be seen as extreme. The husband's approach might be rigid, not allowing for the wife's circumstances. On the other hand, if the wife is not respecting their prior agreement and the husband's wishes, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong. It's a nuanced situation where both parties might have valid points. The key factors are the breach of agreement and the husband's response. If the wife is indeed allowing the father to influence the child against their agreement, the husband is justified. But if there's a misunderstanding or the wife is being coerced, the husband's stance might be too harsh. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances not entirely clear in the post. However, given the information, the husband is within his rights to enforce the agreement he had with his wife, so he might not be in the wrong. But the way he's handling it (threatening divorce) could be seen as extreme. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, if he's acting to uphold their agreement, he might not be. So, answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
