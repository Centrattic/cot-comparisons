She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband (the author) who is an atheist and his wife, who comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is influencing their son against the husband's wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about their children's upbringing. The wife's father is pressuring her and taking the child to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband feels that his authority as a parent is being undermined by the wife's family. He's threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this, even though she's an adult and can make her own choices.\n\nNow, I have to think about the ethical and legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal say in their child's upbringing. However, since the husband is the father, he has legal rights. But the wife is also a parent and might have her own beliefs. The problem here is the interference from the father-in-law, which the husband is trying to prevent. \n\nThe husband's main argument is that he wants his son to be raised secularly as per their agreement. The wife's family is breaking that agreement by involving the child in religious activities without consent. The husband's threat of divorce is a strong measure, but does it make him in the wrong?\n\nOn one hand, he's standing up for his agreed-upon parenting choices. On the other hand, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme, especially since the wife is an adult and can make her own decisions. However, the issue here is about the child's upbringing, which is a joint responsibility. If the wife is allowing her father to influence the child against her husband's wishes, the husband has a valid concern about the child's religious exposure.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's situation. She might be conflicted between her family and her husband. The husband acknowledges that she can make her own choices, but he's not willing to let the child be raised in a way he disagrees with. This could lead to a breakdown in the marriage if the conflict isn't resolved.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights, and the court would consider the child's best interest. If the husband takes legal action, he might have grounds to prevent his father-in-law from influencing the child. However, the threat of divorce over this issue might be seen as a harsh response, especially if the wife isn't directly enforcing the religious upbringing but is allowing her father to do so without the husband's knowledge.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the husband's concern is about protecting his child from religious indoctrination against his agreed-upon values. However, using divorce as a threat could be seen as extreme and may not address the underlying issues, like communication with his wife or legal steps to protect their child's upbringing. \n\nThe wife's role here is also complex. If she's allowing her father to take the child without her knowledge, she's not upholding their initial agreement. The husband's frustration is valid because the agreement is being broken by her family's actions. However, he might need to address this with the wife first through counseling or legal means rather than immediately threatening divorce.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's trying to protect his son's upbringing as agreed. However, his approach of threatening divorce might not be the best way to resolve the conflict, but it's a reaction to a significant breach of their agreement. The key issue is the unauthorized involvement of the father-in-law in the child's life, which the husband is trying to prevent. Therefore, the husband's stance could be justified, but the method of resolution is questionable. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, if his actions are in line with protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement, then he might not be in the wrong. But if he's overstepping by threatening divorce without addressing the issue through proper channels first, he might be in the wrong. \n\nGiven the information, the husband's primary concern is valid, and the threat of divorce is a consequence of a broken agreement. However, the appropriateness of the threat is debatable. But based on the scenario, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
