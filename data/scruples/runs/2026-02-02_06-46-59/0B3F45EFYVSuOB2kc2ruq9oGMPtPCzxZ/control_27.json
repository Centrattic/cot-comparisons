She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce over his wife's religious upbringing of their son.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist who married a woman who was previously agnostic. They agreed to raise their children secularly. Now, the wife's family, who are fundamentalist Muslims, are pressuring her to take their son to the mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nThe author feels that the father-in-law is exerting control over the wife and the child against his wishes. He's upset because he agreed to have kids only under secular upbringing. The wife's family doesn't like him, and the father-in-law is ignoring the author's objections.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement between the couple about their child's upbringing, the father-in-law's actions without the author's consent, and the author's stance on not allowing religious influence he opposes. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, both parents have rights, but since the child is an infant, the father's objection to religious instruction without his consent is a valid concern. However, the author's immediate threat of divorce might be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of personal values and boundaries.\n\nThe author is standing by his agreement and protecting his child's upbringing as per their mutual understanding. The wife's family overstepping and the father-in-law's disregard for the author's wishes add to the conflict. The author's decision to prioritize his secular values over his wife's changing stance (possibly influenced by her family) is a personal choice, but it's within his rights as a parent to express that.\n\nSo, considering the context of prior agreement, the unauthorized actions by the father-in-law, and the author's attempt to uphold the original understanding, the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
