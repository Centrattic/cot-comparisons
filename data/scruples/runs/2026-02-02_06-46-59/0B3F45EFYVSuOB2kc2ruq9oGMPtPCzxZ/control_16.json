She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple with different religious backgrounds. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was previously agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam, influenced by her family. They had agreed that their kids would be raised secularly. The wife's father, who is a fundamentalist Muslim, took their son to the mosque without the husband's consent, which is the main conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. Both parents had agreed that their children would be raised secularly unless the children choose otherwise later. The husband is standing by that agreement, while the wife might be going back on it due to family pressure. The father-in-law's actions are against the husband's wishes, which complicates things.\n\nThe husband's stance is that he wants his son to be raised without religious influence, especially from the father-in-law. He's threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this. The wife might feel torn between her husband's wishes and her family's expectations. However, she's an adult and has the autonomy to make decisions, but she's also part of this agreement. If she's going against what they agreed on, that could be a problem.\n\nThe father-in-law's behavior is problematic. He's taking the child without permission and trying to influence him, which the husband rightly objects to. The husband is asserting his parental rights here. But the question is whether his threat of divorce is justified. Divorce over this issue might be extreme, but the core issue is about the children's upbringing, which is a significant matter.\n\nThe husband might be in the right in wanting to protect his son from unwanted religious influence. However, threatening divorce over a disagreement about parenting could be seen as harsh. It depends on whether the wife is actually agreeing to this or if she's being pressured. If the wife is complicit or not stopping her father, that's another layer. But if she's not, maybe the father-in-law is the real problem here.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is making a firm stand, which could be necessary to protect the child's upbringing. However, using divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme. The answer hinges on whether the husband's actions are a reasonable response to protect his child's welfare or if he's overstepping by threatening divorce over a disagreement that should be resolved through other means.\n\nI think the key points are the existing agreement, the father-in-law's interference, and the husband's attempt to protect the child. The husband isn't in the wrong because he's upholding their agreement and safeguarding his child's upbringing. The wife might need to address her family's influence, but the husband's stance is about parental rights and respecting the initial agreement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
