She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple's disagreement over raising their child's religion. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They agreed to raise their kids secular, but the wife's father is pressuring them to raise the child Muslim, even against the husband's wishes. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement before having kids, so the husband believes they should stick to that. The wife's father is pressuring them, and the husband is upset that the father-in-law is taking the child to the mosque without consent. The husband is standing firm on his decision, saying it's his son too and he doesn't want the religion imposed on him.\n\nNow, thinking about the husband's perspective. He's respecting the initial agreement they made, trying to protect his child from religious influence he disagrees with. He's also trying to stand up against his in-laws' pressure, which is significant given the cultural context. Divorce is a drastic step, but he feels it's necessary to protect his child's upbringing.\n\nOn the wife's side, she might be caught between her husband and her family. She might feel the pressure from her family to conform, even if she's not as religious. The husband is accusing her of continuing to let her father influence their son, which could be a point of conflict. However, the wife might feel torn between her husband and her family, especially if her father is acting without their knowledge.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have equal rights in raising the child. The husband is asserting his right to prevent religious instruction against his wishes. However, the wife might have her own cultural values and might feel that her family's involvement is harmless or that she's being disrespectful to her roots by completely cutting them off.\n\nEthically, the question is about parental rights and the best interest of the child. The husband believes that imposing religion without consent is wrong, while the wife might see her family's involvement as beneficial. The father-in-law's actions are unilateral and against the husband's wishes, which is a problem.\n\nBut the husband's threat to divorce is a major consequence. Is it right for him to hold this over the wife? If the wife is complicit in allowing her father to take the child, maybe she's not standing by her husband's side. But if she's being pressured by her family and feeling conflicted, maybe the husband needs to work with her to set boundaries rather than threatening divorce.\n\nCultural sensitivity is also a factor here. The wife's family might see their involvement as natural, but the husband perceives it as overstepping. The husband's background is Christian, but he's an atheist, so maybe he's more sensitive to religious upbringing. The wife's family's disapproval of him (because he's white and from a Christian home) adds tension.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband is trying to protect his child's upbringing as per their agreement. The wife allowing her father to take the child without consent might be a breach of trust. However, the husband's approach of threatening divorce could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is trying to find a balance. Maybe communication and mediation could resolve this without divorce.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The husband is standing up for his values and the agreement they had. He's not allowing external family to influence their child without consent. The father-in-law's actions are problematic. The husband's stance could be justified if the wife is not respecting their initial agreement. However, if the wife is being coerced by her family, the blame might not be entirely on her. The husband's response might be harsh, but given the circumstances, he might feel it's necessary.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong), as he's upholding their agreement and protecting his child's upbringing. However, some might argue that his response is too extreme. But given the context, his actions are based on respecting their prior agreement and protecting his child's future.\n"
