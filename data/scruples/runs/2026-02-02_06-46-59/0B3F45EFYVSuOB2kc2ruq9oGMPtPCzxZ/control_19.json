She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist, married to a woman from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their kids secularly, but now the author's father-in-law is taking their son to the mosque without permission. The author is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had a mutual agreement on secular upbringing. The father-in-law is exerting pressure, which the author is against. The wife might be conflicted between her family's expectations and her agreement with her husband.\n\nThe author's stance is about protecting his son from religious indoctrination against his wishes. But is it right to use the threat of divorce over this? Divorce is a major consequence, so maybe there's a question about whether the author is overreacting. However, the father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes, which could be a serious issue.\n\nAlso, the wife's role here is important. She agreed to the secular upbringing, but maybe she's not standing up to her family. The author is trying to enforce the agreement, but if the wife is complicit or not stopping her father, that could affect the dynamics. However, the author is within his rights to want to protect his child's upbringing as agreed.\n\nAnother angle is the father-in-law's actions. Taking the child without consent could be seen as a violation, especially if the husband is the legal parent. The author's reaction might be justified if the father-in-law is not respecting parental rights.\n\nBut does the author have a right to threaten divorce over this? It depends on the circumstances. If the wife is not directly involved, maybe the author is targeting her for her father's actions. However, since the wife is part of the family, she might be seen as allowing the father to do this, which complicates things.\n\nIn some cultures, there's a lot of family influence, and the author might be standing up for what he believes in. On the other hand, threatening divorce over religious upbringing could be seen as extreme, especially if the wife is trying to balance both sides. It's possible the author is not in the wrong because he's protecting his agreed-upon values, but there's a need for communication and understanding with his wife.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author is upholding the agreement they had, and the father-in-law's actions are interfering. However, the method of using divorce as a threat might be harsh, but given the circumstances, it's his right to set boundaries for his child's upbringing.\n"
