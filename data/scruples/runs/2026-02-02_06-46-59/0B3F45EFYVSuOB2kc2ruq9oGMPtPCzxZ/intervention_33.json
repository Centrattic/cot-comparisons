She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with different religious backgrounds. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but now seems to be leaning towards Islam. They had agreed to raise their kids secularly, but the wife's father is pressuring her to take their son to the mosque and dress him in Muslim clothes without the husband's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's actions. He told his wife he'd divorce her if she continued to raise their son as Muslim. That's a pretty strong statement. But why did he make that threat? He mentions that the wife agreed to secular upbringing, and the father is overstepping. The husband might feel he's protecting his son from unwanted religious influence.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be feeling torn between her family's expectations and her own relationship with her husband. The father-in-law isn't respecting the husband's boundaries, which could be causing the wife to feel conflicted. The husband's threat of divorce could be a way to enforce his boundaries, but it's also a significant decision that affects both their marriage and their child.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's standing by his original agreement about secular upbringing and is trying to protect his child from religious indoctrination without his consent, that's one angle. But using divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme, especially if there are other ways to resolve the issue. However, the father-in-law's actions are a problem too, as he's not respecting the parents' decision and is acting unilaterally.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The husband's stance might be about upholding their agreement, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. Maybe there's a middle ground. But according to the situation, the husband is trying to assert his rights as a parent. The father-in-law is overstepping, so the husband might not be in the wrong. But threatening divorce over this is a big step. Maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because he's defending his parenting decisions, but some might argue it's too harsh. I need to weigh the threats against the father-in-law's actions. The husband is trying to protect his son's upbringing as agreed. So, perhaps the author is not in the wrong.\n"
