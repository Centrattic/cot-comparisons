She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with different religious beliefs. The husband is an atheist, and the wife was agnostic when they married. They agreed to raise their children secularly. However, after their son is born, the wife's Muslim family starts pressuring them to involve the child in their religion, and the husband finds out that his father-in-law has been taking the son to the mosque without his consent.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for threatening divorce if his wife continues to allow this. The options are A for yes or B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring them, and despite the husband's objections, the father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes. The husband feels that his religious freedom and parenting rights are being violated. The wife, however, might be struggling with her own family's expectations and perhaps her own beliefs, given her immigrant background.\n\nThe husband's main argument is about respecting the agreed-upon upbringing of their child. He's asserting his right to co-parent without interference from the wife's family. The wife's actions, whether intentional or not, are leading to the child being exposed to religion without the husband's consent. The husband feels he has tried to communicate his stance but hasn't been heeded, leading to his ultimatum.\n\nNow, considering ethical and legal aspects. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, but they also have the responsibility to act in the child's best interest. If one parent is undermining the agreed-upon parenting approach by involving external family members without the other parent's consent, that could be problematic. The husband is trying to enforce the agreement they made when they had kids, which is a valid point.\n\nHowever, the wife's situation is also complex. She's dealing with her family's pressure and might be struggling with her own identity and beliefs. She agreed to the secular upbringing, but her family's influence might be challenging her to adhere to that. The husband's response of threatening divorce is drastic, but he might feel it's necessary to protect his son's upbringing.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's approach could be seen as controlling or dismissive of his wife's autonomy. By taking such a firm stance, he might be pressuring her into a difficult position between her husband and her family. However, given that he's trying to uphold the original agreement and protect the child from unwanted religious influence, some might see his actions as justified.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights in child custody and upbringing unless a court decides otherwise. If the father-in-law is acting without consent, that could be a violation of parental rights. The husband's stance could be seen as defending those rights.\n\nBut the ethical question is more nuanced. The husband's use of divorce as a threat might be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances, it could be a matter of principle. The key is whether he's overstepping by not allowing any religious influence, even if the wife is complicit in some way. However, since the father-in-law is acting without consent, the husband is protecting his son's upbringing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's methods might be harsh, his intent to uphold the agreed-upon parenting plan and protect his son from unwanted religious influence is understandable. The wife's position is also difficult, but the husband is asserting his parental rights. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
