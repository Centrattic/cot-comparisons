She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with different religious backgrounds. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic when they married but now seems to be leaning into Islam, possibly due to family pressure. They agreed to raise their kids secular. The father-in-law is taking their son to the mosque without permission. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to let this happen.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she's possibly being influenced. The father-in-law is acting against the husband's wishes. The husband feels the father-in-law is undermining his authority as a parent. The husband's main issue is that he doesn't want their son raised in a specific religion against his wishes. \n\nBut there's a part where the husband says the wife agreed to secular upbringing. However, now she's allowing her father to take the son. The husband is asserting his right to decide the child's upbringing, which is a common concern in custody and parenting rights. However, the wife might be feeling torn between her family and her husband, especially if she's under pressure from her father. \n\nThe question is whether the husband's threat of divorce is justified. He's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan. But the wife might have her own reasons, perhaps feeling conflicted or coerced by her family. The husband's stance is about protecting his son from religious influence he disagrees with, which is a valid concern. However, threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme if the wife is also trying to navigate her family's expectations. \n\nBut since the wife had agreed beforehand, the husband's position might be that she's breaking the agreement by allowing her father's influence. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of that agreement. The husband is trying to enforce the original pact. On the other hand, if the wife is also struggling with her own identity or family pressure, the husband's response could be seen as not supportive enough. \n\nBut the main issue here is the violation of the agreed-upon parenting plan. The husband is taking a firm stance to protect his child's upbringing, which he considers a core value. Threatening divorce is a serious step, but if the wife is not respecting the agreement and the father-in-law is involved against his wishes, it's a significant conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. The husband is defending his parental rights and the agreement. The wife's actions might be influenced by her family, but she's an adult and should be held accountable for following the agreement. The husband's threat is about enforcing the terms they had. So, from a legal and ethical standpoint, he's protecting his child's upbringing as they had agreed. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014threatening divorce\u2014might be harsh, but the principle of upholding the agreement could justify it. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
