She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for threatening divorce if his wife continues to raise their son as Muslim. The context is a marital conflict involving religious upbringing and in-law dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is an atheist, the wife was agnostic but from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. The wife's father is pressuring her, and he took the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband is upset because he feels his wishes about his son's upbringing are being ignored, and he's considering divorce if the situation continues.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, including religion. However, if one parent is acting unilaterally against the other's wishes, that can be a point of contention. However, in some jurisdictions, both parents share legal custody, so major decisions require mutual agreement. If the wife is acting in violation of their prior agreement, the husband has a right to be concerned. But threatening divorce over this might be seen as extreme, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's complicity in allowing those interactions without the husband's consent could be an issue. The husband feels his parental rights are being violated. However, threatening divorce immediately might not be the best approach; communication or mediation might be more appropriate first steps. That said, if there's a fundamental disagreement on such a core issue as the child's upbringing, walking away could be seen as justified.\n\nPotential issues to consider: Cultural and religious differences, the wife's autonomy vs. the husband's rights, the father-in-law's overreach, and the potential impact on the child. The husband's stance on not wanting the religion \"drilled into\" the child could conflict with the wife's family's influence. However, the wife's own actions in acceding to her father's demands might be where the problem lies.\n\nIn terms of legal standing, if the parents are married and both have custody, the husband's refusal to allow religious instruction could be within his rights. But if the wife is going against his wishes, it's a conflict of parental rights. The threat of divorce is a personal decision, but whether it's \"wrong\" depends on whether the husband's actions are legally and ethically justified. Since both parents have rights, but the wife is acting against the agreed-upon arrangement, the husband's reaction might be seen as protecting his interests. However, the abruptness of threatening divorce could be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a matter of perspective.\n\nSo, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing by his prior agreement and protecting his parental rights. But there's nuance. The wife might have her own reasons for complying with her family, so the situation is complex. But legally and in terms of parental rights, the husband isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
