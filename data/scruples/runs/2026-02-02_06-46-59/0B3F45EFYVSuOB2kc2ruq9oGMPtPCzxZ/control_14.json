She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with differing religious beliefs and a conflict over how their son is being raised.\n\nFirst, the husband is an atheist and wanted their children to be raised secular. The wife was initially agnostic but now her family is pushing Islamic practices onto their son. The husband found out her father took their son to a mosque without permission and dressed him in Muslim clothes. The father is upset about this and threatened divorce if it continues.\n\nI need to consider the parents' rights. Both parents have the right to their beliefs, but the child's upbringing is a shared responsibility. The father is concerned about his son's exposure to religion without his consent. However, the mother might feel pressured by her family. The key issue is whether the father's threat of divorce is justified.\n\nThe husband's stance is about protecting his child from religion, which he sees as against their agreement. The wife, however, might feel torn between her family's expectations and her marriage. The father-in-law's actions might be overstepping, but the husband's threat of divorce over this could be seen as extreme. \n\nLegal perspectives vary, but generally, both parents have input in a child's upbringing. The husband's approach might be seen as controlling if he's dismissing the mother's role. However, the father-in-law's actions without consent are problematic. \n\nThe husband's main point is about respecting his wishes regarding the child's upbringing, which is valid, but threatening divorce over this alone could be seen as harsh. The wife might need to navigate this conflict between her family and her husband, but the husband's ultimatum might not leave room for compromise, which could be where he's in the wrong.\n"
