She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the husband is an atheist and the wife comes from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues to allow this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, and neither can unilaterally decide the religious upbringing without the other's consent. The father is concerned about his son being exposed to religion without his approval, which might be a valid legal and ethical issue. However, the husband's approach of threatening divorce seems extreme. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the wife's autonomy. The wife is an adult, and while she's married, her choices shouldn't be entirely controlled by her husband. But she did agree to raise the child secularly. Her father's actions are against the parents' agreement, so she might be complicit if she's not preventing it. However, the husband's threat to divorce over this could be seen as overreacting, especially since the son is an infant. \n\nThe father-in-law's actions are problematic because he's taking the child without consent. The husband has a right to be involved in decisions regarding his child's upbringing. But threatening divorce immediately might not be the best approach. It's possible that the husband is right in wanting to protect his son's upbringing but is handling it in a way that's causing unnecessary conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel torn between her husband and her family. If she's allowing her father to influence their child, despite her initial agreement with her husband, that could be a breach of their compromise. But the husband's ultimatum could be destroying their marriage without giving them a chance to resolve the issue through communication or mediation.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the husband might have a valid concern, but his threat to divorce seems harsh and possibly unnecessary. The wife's actions are also questionable if she's not standing up to her father. It's a complex situation where both parties have responsibilities. However, the husband's immediate threat to divorce over this issue might make him at fault, as it's an extreme measure without exploring other solutions first.\n"
