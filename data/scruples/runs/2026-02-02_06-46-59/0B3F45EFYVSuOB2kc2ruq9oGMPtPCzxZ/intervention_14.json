She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple disagreeing on their son's religious upbringing. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a fundamentalist Muslim family. They had agreed the kids would be raised secular, but now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent. The husband is threatening divorce if the wife continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had an agreement before having children, so the husband had expectations. The wife's family is pressuring her, and she might be influenced despite the agreement. The husband feels the father-in-law is overstepping, and the wife is struggling between her family's expectations and her own.\n\nThe husband says he won't allow his son to be raised Muslim, even if it means splitting up. So, is he in the wrong? Well, parents do have a right to certain decisions about their children's upbringing, but both parents should ideally agree. However, the wife's father taking the child without consent is a problem, and the husband is standing up for his beliefs. But maybe the husband is being too rigid? The wife might be feeling torn between her husband and her family. \n\nOn the other hand, threatening divorce over the child's religion could be seen as extreme. There might be a middle ground, like counseling or legal measures to protect the child's upbringing. However, considering the father's actions in taking the child without consent, the husband's stance is understandable. It's a conflict between parental rights and family interference. The wife's actions might be seen as not respecting her husband's wishes, but she might be under pressure from her family. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the husband might not be entirely wrong because he's protecting his belief and the child's upbringing. But threatening divorce immediately could be seen as harsh. However, if the wife is going against the agreed-upon secular upbringing, especially through the father's interference, then the husband's reaction is justified. The father-in-law's actions are problematic, and the husband is trying to stop them. It's a difficult situation, but I think the husband's stance is about protecting his son's upbringing as per their agreement, so he might not be in the wrong.\n"
