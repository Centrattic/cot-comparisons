She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author (let's call him A) is married to a woman from an immigrant family who are fundamentalist Muslims. A is an atheist. They had agreed to raise their children secularly, but after the birth of their son, the author's father-in-law started taking the son to the mosque without consent. A confronts his wife and eventually threatens divorce if she continues to let this happen.\n\nSo, the main points: They had an agreement. The father-in-law is acting without consent, which A has already warned against. A is standing by his decision to protect his son's upbringing according to their agreement. But the wife might be influenced by her family, which complicates things.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that A might be in the wrong, but they want to know if that's correct. The user is asking for an analysis.\n\nFirst, the legal angle: In many places, both parents have rights to their child's upbringing. If the father-in-law is acting without consent, that's a red flag. However, the mother (A's wife) is the parent here, so if she's allowing the father-in-law to take the child, that might be a factor. But the original agreement between A and his wife was secular upbringing. If she's now allowing religious influence, that could be a breach of their agreement.\n\nMoral/ethical angle: A is standing up for his beliefs and wants to protect his son from what he sees as unwanted religious influence. However, threatening divorce over it could be seen as extreme. But if it's a matter of a fundamental disagreement on child-rearing, which is a key aspect of marriage, then it's a significant issue. Also, the father-in-law's actions without consent are problematic, as parental consent is usually required for such decisions.\n\nCommunication aspect: A has tried to tell his wife multiple times, but she's not heeding. If the wife is complicit in allowing her father to take the child, that's a problem. However, if the wife is under pressure from her family and feeling conflicted, maybe A needs to approach the situation differently, like mediation or counseling.\n\nCultural context: The wife is from a strict Muslim family, and her father's actions are against A's wishes. The wife's happiness in the home versus her family's influence is a key point. The father-in-law's behavior might be seen as overstepping, but the wife's role here is crucial.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the question is whether A is in the wrong for threatening divorce. If the wife is not respecting the agreement and is allowing her family to influence the child without consent, then A might not be in the wrong. However, if A is being too rigid and not addressing the issue through proper channels (like legal or family counseling), maybe he's not handling it the best way. But the threat of divorce over a fundamental disagreement on child-rearing could be justified if they agreed on that as a non-negotiable part of their marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, if A is making a unilateral decision without considering the wife's perspective and the fact that she might be struggling with her family's pressure, then perhaps he's overstepping. The wife might feel torn between her spouse and her family, and divorce could be a harsh consequence if there's still a chance to resolve the issue.\n\nBut the key point here is the violation of their pre-existing agreement. If the wife is going against the agreement they made before having children, then A's stance is about honoring that agreement. Given that, maybe A is not in the wrong, especially since the father-in-law is acting without consent. The main issue is the breach of trust and agreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing by the agreement they made and protecting his son from unwanted influence. However, there's a need for better communication and possibly mediation instead of an ultimatum, but the threat of divorce over a significant breach of agreement might be a reasonable stance in this context.\n"
