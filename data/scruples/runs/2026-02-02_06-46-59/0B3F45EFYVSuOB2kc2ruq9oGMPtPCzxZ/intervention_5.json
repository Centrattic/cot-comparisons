She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple disagreeing on raising their child as a Muslim versus secular. The husband is an atheist, the wife used to be agnostic but now is pushed by her family. The father-in-law took the son to the mosque without the husband's knowledge, leading the husband to threaten divorce if the wife continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreements they had before having kids. The wife agreed to a secular upbringing if they had children, so she's going back on that. The husband feels it's against their prior understanding. On the other hand, the wife might be influenced by her family's pressure, and maybe she's struggling with her own beliefs now. The father-in-law's actions are a problem because the husband didn't consent to this exposure. \n\nBut the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. The wife is an adult, so she has her own choices. However, the child's upbringing is a joint responsibility. The husband's main issue is that the child is being exposed to religion without his consent. The wife might be trying to maintain family relationships, but she also agreed to the secular approach. The husband is standing by his agreement, but threatening divorce over it seems extreme. \n\nWait, but the father-in-law took the son without their knowledge. That's a breach of trust. The husband is trying to protect his son from unwanted religious influence. However, the wife is also an adult, and maybe she should have a say in her child's upbringing. The problem is that the husband is using the threat of divorce to enforce his stance, which could be seen as controlling. But the wife might not be acting against the agreement. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe husband's right to co-parenting and his prior agreement are factors. The wife's family pressure and her possible internal conflict might be part of the story. The husband's response is a serious consequence. Maybe the key is whether the wife is actively violating their agreement by allowing the father-in-law to influence the child. If the wife isn't directly doing that, but her father is, then the husband's anger is misplaced. However, if the wife is enabling this by not stopping her father, then she might be at fault. The answer depends on whether the wife is acting against their agreement. The husband's threat of divorce seems harsh unless there's a clear violation. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because using divorce as a threat over a child's religious upbringing without considering the wife's role and consent might be extreme. But if the wife is indeed breaking their agreement, then he's justified (B). The text says she agreed they'd be secular, but her father did it without their knowledge. The wife might be unaware or complicit. The husband's approach is confrontational. So, the answer could be A if the threat is too severe, or B if he's protecting his prior agreement. I'm leaning towards A because threatening divorce over this without addressing the wife's actions directly might be inconsiderate. Also, the wife's mental health is mentioned, so maybe he should be more understanding. But the father-in-law's actions are a breach. Hmm. The correct answer might hinge on the wife's agency. Since the wife is the one making decisions for the child, and she hasn't directly violated their agreement (as her father did it without their knowledge), the husband's reaction is maybe unwarranted. So the author is in the wrong (A). But I need to make sure. The prior agreement was between the couple, not involving the in-laws. If the wife is not following through, even if her father is doing it behind their backs, then the husband is justified. But the wife might be trying to balance her family's expectations. The answer is A if he's wrong, B if not. I think A because the threat of divorce is too harsh, and the issue might be more about the father-in-law's interference rather than the wife's direct actions. The husband should address the in-laws without threatening the marriage.\n"
