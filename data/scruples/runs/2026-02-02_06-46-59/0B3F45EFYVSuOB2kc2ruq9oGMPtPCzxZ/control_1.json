She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple with different religious views. The husband is an atheist, and the wife is from a Muslim immigrant family. They agreed to raise their kids secularly. But now the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the husband's consent, and the husband threatens divorce if this continues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had an agreement before having kids about secular upbringing. The wife's family is pressuring them, and the husband is upset because the father-in-law is influencing the child against the husband's wishes. The husband is taking a firm stance, even threatening divorce, to prevent his son from being raised Muslim.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wife agreed to the secular upbringing initially, but now she's allowing her father to take the child to the mosque. The husband feels his boundaries are being crossed. However, the wife might have her own reasons for wanting to maintain some cultural or religious ties for the child. \n\nBut the problem here is the lack of communication. The husband says he's told her multiple times, but she's still allowing the father-in-law to do this. The wife might be struggling with her own family's expectations versus her and her husband's agreement. The husband's reaction is extreme\u2014threatening divorce over a disagreement about religious upbringing. That's a major life decision and might be seen as disproportionate if the wife is complicit or if there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlso, the husband's approach could be problematic. While he has a right to his beliefs, threatening divorce over this situation might not consider the wife's autonomy and her possible desire to maintain her heritage. It could be seen as controlling if he's dictating terms without mutual discussion. The wife's family's disapproval and the pressure might also affect her mental health, which the husband acknowledges she's experiencing.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is protecting his parental rights to not have his child raised in a religion he opposes. However, the threat of divorce solely based on this issue without trying to resolve it through dialogue or legal means first might be seen as excessive. The wife's actions in allowing the father to take the child without the husband's consent could be a point of contention, but the solution being divorce might not address the underlying communication issues.\n\nIn many places, both parents have rights over their child's upbringing. If there's a conflict, it's usually resolved through legal channels, not by ending the marriage. The husband's ultimatum could be seen as taking matters into his own hands instead of seeking mediation or legal advice. So maybe he's in the wrong for not addressing it through appropriate means and for making a drastic threat without considering the wife's perspective.\n\nHowever, if the wife is actively complicit in allowing the father to influence the child, then the husband's frustration is understandable. But threatening divorce is a heavy response. The key here is whether there was mutual agreement and if the wife is respecting that agreement. If she's not, the husband has a right to be upset, but the method of response could be questionable.\n\nIn terms of family law, typically both parents have rights, but if there's an agreement, the other parent might have legal recourse. The husband's approach might not be legally sound and could be seen as acting unilaterally. So, considering all these factors, the husband might be in the wrong for not using proper channels and for making a threat that's too extreme without sufficient discussion with his wife.\n"
