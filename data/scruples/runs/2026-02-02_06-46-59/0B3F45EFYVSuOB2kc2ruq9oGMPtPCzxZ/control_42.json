She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated because it involves religion, family dynamics, and a marriage where both partners have different beliefs.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist and his wife used to be too. They agreed that their children would be raised in a secular environment, with the option to choose their own religion later. The wife's family is fundamentalist Muslim and doesn't like the author, which is causing tension. Now, the wife's father is taking their son to the mosque without the author's knowledge, which the author is upset about. He's so upset that he told his wife he'll divorce her if she continues to let this happen.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial agreement, the breach of that agreement by the wife's family, and the author's threat to divorce. The wife might feel caught between her family and her husband. The author's stance is that he won't let his son be raised in a way he disagrees with, even if it means ending the marriage. \n\nBut wait, the wife agreed to the secular upbringing. If she's allowing her father to take the child without her consent, maybe she's not following through on their agreement. The author has a right to be concerned about his child's upbringing. However, threatening divorce over this might be extreme. The wife's actions could be influenced by family pressure, and maybe she's struggling with her own beliefs or family expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is protecting his values and wants his child to have a secular upbringing. The father-in-law's actions are a breach of the parents' agreement. The author has a right to be the parent and make decisions about his child's upbringing. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening divorce\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if the wife is conflicted and not fully in agreement with the father's actions.\n\nBut the wife agreed to the secular upbringing, so if she's allowing her father to interfere, maybe she's violating that agreement. The author's stance is about upholding the agreement they made. Still, the divorce threat might be too extreme. The wife might need support and understanding to resist her family's pressure rather than facing a threat from her husband.\n\nAlso, the father-in-law's actions are problematic, but the wife's role in allowing it is part of the issue. The author is trying to protect his child, but the method might be causing more harm. It's a tough situation where both sides might have valid points. However, the author is standing up for his beliefs and the child's upbringing, which are important parental rights. The wife might need to take a stronger stand against her family to honor her agreement with her husband.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's threat of divorce is serious, the core issue is about protecting the child's upbringing as agreed. If the wife is not fulfilling her part of the agreement, the author is justified in taking a firm stance. However, the divorce threat is a heavy measure. The answer might depend on whether the author is enforcing the agreement or overreacting. Given the circumstances, the author is not in the wrong because he's protecting his child's upbringing as per their agreement.\n"
