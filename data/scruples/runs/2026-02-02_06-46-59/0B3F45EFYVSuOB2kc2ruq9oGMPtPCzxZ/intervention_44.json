She is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. I am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. She continued to put on a front for her muslim father.\n\nHer family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. That is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.\n\nMy wife lives with me. We agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. She agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. Her family did not show up to our wedding.\n\nNow that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. I refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.\n\nSo im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? No sir. My father in law has a gross control over my wife.\n\nShe is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. When she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.\n\nHe is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. She is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. However i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.\n\nHe is my son too, and hes a baby. I have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. My father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. He acts like i am not the boys father.\n\nI flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple with a child, where the husband is an atheist and the wife, from a Muslim immigrant family, is now trying to raise their son as Muslim. The father is threatening divorce if she continues. The wife agreed to raise the child secularly before the marriage, but now the father-in-law is influencing the child against the husband's wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights in raising their children, but the father's rights might be challenged here. However, the mother is the one actually interacting with the child, so her actions could influence the child's upbringing. The father's threat to divorce if she continues to raise the child Muslim could be seen as controlling. But if he's the one who initially agreed to secular upbringing and now is enforcing that, maybe he's within his rights.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The wife is living with her husband and seems to be happy, but her family is pressuring her. The father-in-law has gone behind the husband's back to take the child to the mosque, which violates the husband's wishes. The husband feels that his input is being ignored.\n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement before the marriage about secular upbringing, the mother's change in stance post-birth, and the father's reaction. The father is trying to protect his son from religious influence, which he didn't agree to. However, threatening divorce over differing parenting styles might be extreme. The mother's actions could be seen as a breach of their agreement, but if she's under family pressure, it complicates things.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. The wife's family is fundamentalist, and she might be under significant pressure to conform. The father-in-law's actions might be part of that pressure. The husband is trying to assert his right to co-parent, which is valid, but his approach (threatening divorce) might not be the healthiest or fairest. However, given the circumstances, he's standing up for his beliefs and the agreed-upon parenting plan.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband is enforcing an agreement he had before the marriage, which is reasonable. The wife, however, is changing her stance under family pressure, which might be why the husband is frustrated. His threat of divorce is a strong move, but it's in response to what he perceives as a violation of their agreement and his rights as a parent. The father-in-law's actions are definitely problematic, but the husband's response might be seen as extreme. However, given the circumstances, he's trying to protect his child's upbringing as agreed. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. I think the answer is B (No).\n"
