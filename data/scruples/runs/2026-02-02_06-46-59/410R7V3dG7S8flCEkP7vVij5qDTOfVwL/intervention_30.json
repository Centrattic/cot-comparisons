I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves someone who keeps initiating plans, cancels last minute, and then the author finally confronts them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl messaged out of the blue four times, made plans, and canceled each time on the day. After the fourth time, the author told her politely that they value their time and don't want it wasted. She apologized, mentioned her anxiety and issues with relationships. The author was understanding then. \n\nThen, a week later, she called and asked to make dinner at his place. He agreed, but she canceled again, saying she's not comfortable coming alone. He offered alternatives, but she preferred staying home. At that point, he got fed up and told her off, saying he was insulted and that if she has issues, she shouldn't make plans with him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Well, from the author's perspective, he's being respectful initially. He's polite when she cancels. After multiple cancellations, he's firm but polite in his message. Then, when she asks again, he's accommodating, even changing plans when she cancels. But when she's being uncooperative again, he's justified in his frustration. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's behavior is indeed problematic. She keeps initiating plans, which implies some level of interest, but then cancels without giving much notice. Even after she apologized, she's doing the same again. The author has the right to set boundaries. However, his final response might have been a bit harsh. Instead of getting angry, maybe he could have communicated more clearly from the start. But given the repeated cancellations, he's within his rights to stop engaging. \n\nBut wait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because he didn't consider her anxiety enough? But she's the one initiating, so she's responsible for her actions. If someone keeps making plans and canceling, it's reasonable to feel used. The author is not obligated to accommodate her anxiety if it's affecting him negatively. \n\nSo, the key is: Is it wrong for him to be upset after multiple offenses? Probably not. He's being patient and understanding, but after four times, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The final confrontation was direct but not unreasonable. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
