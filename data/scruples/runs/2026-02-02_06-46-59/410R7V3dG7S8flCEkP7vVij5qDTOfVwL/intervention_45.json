I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times because she was nervous. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girl initially asked him out, which he declined, but they still saw each other at functions. Then, over four months, she messaged him four times to make plans, each time canceling the day of. The author handled the first four cancellations politely, even after the fourth time, she apologized and explained her anxiety. The fifth time, she changed the plan again, leading the author to confront her.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. Repeated cancellations can be frustrating, especially when someone keeps initiating contact. On the other hand, the girl has anxiety and struggles with forming relationships. She did apologize and explain her issues, which the author acknowledged.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author tried to be understanding initially, but after multiple instances, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The girl's actions might be a result of her mental health, but that doesn't mean she should keep making plans if she can't commit. However, the author's response was to tell her off, which might be a valid way to express frustration. \n\nBut wait, did the author give her enough support? Maybe he could have suggested a different approach, like meeting in a less intimidating environment or adjusting their plans to accommodate her anxiety. However, the author also has the right to his time and shouldn't be expected to work through someone else's issues indefinitely without reciprocity.\n\nThe girl's responsibility is to not make plans if she can't keep them, especially after knowing the author's feelings about wasting time. The author's frustration is legitimate. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his feelings, especially after multiple instances. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, even if they stem from anxiety. The author had the right to set a boundary. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
