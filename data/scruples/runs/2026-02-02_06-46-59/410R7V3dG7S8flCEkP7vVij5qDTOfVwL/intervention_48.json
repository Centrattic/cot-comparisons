I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author met a girl who initially declined a dinner date but kept running into her at events. Then, after four to five months, the girl messaged him out of the blue four times to set up dinner plans, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite each time, even after the fourth cancellation, when he finally told her he values his time and didn't appreciate being treated that way. She apologized, explaining her anxiety and issues with relationships. He said it's okay. Then, another time, she wanted to come to his house for dinner, but she backed out again, and he offered to go out instead, but she wanted to stay home. The author then got fed up and told her he was insulted and that if she had anxiety, she shouldn't make plans she can't keep.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her off, and the user thinks he is, but is curious. So, the question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nFirst, let's break it down. The girl initiated contact four times, each time leading to a cancellation. The author was patient, even after the fourth time, but eventually set a boundary. The key points here are about communication, respect for time, and handling anxiety.\n\nOn the one hand, the girl has anxiety, which is a valid reason for her actions. People with anxiety might overcommit or have difficulty following through. The author might not be in a position to judge her for that. However, the girl initiated these plans multiple times, which could imply that she felt comfortable making commitments despite her anxiety. The author might have a right to feel that his time is being disrespected, especially if this happened repeatedly.\n\nBut the other side is that the author did give her multiple chances and was polite each time. After the fourth cancellation, he expressed his feelings calmly. Then she apologized, and he accepted. Then, another incident happened, leading to his final reaction. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if he's a busy person. But when he finally told her off, was that the right approach?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess whether the author overstepped or if it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author's main issue is that he feels his time is being wasted, and he's being treated like he's available whenever she initiates, which is not the case. Setting boundaries is generally healthy, especially in relationships. If someone is repeatedly making plans they can't keep, it's reasonable to communicate that it's not okay anymore.\n\nHowever, the author's final message might have come off as harsh, especially if he was \"pretty much telling her he was insulted\" and implying that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it. That might not be supportive of her anxiety. It's possible that the author could have handled it more compassionately, but does that make him in the wrong? Or is it about mutual respect?\n\nThe girl initiated the plans each time, so perhaps the author wasn't obligated to accept every invitation. But by accepting and then getting upset when she canceled, maybe the author is inconsistent. However, the key is that she kept initiating after previous cancellations. It's possible that the author gave her too many chances, but once he set a boundary, she crossed it again, leading to his justified frustration.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions might be seen as standing up for himself, which is important. But if he was dismissive of her anxiety without offering support, that could be problematic. The question is whether he was in the wrong for expressing his feelings and setting a boundary. Since he had already given her multiple chances and she continued the behavior, his reaction might be reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he set a boundary after repeated disrespect to his time, which is a reasonable action.\n"
