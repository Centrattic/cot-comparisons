I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled their plans four times due to nervousness or anxiety. \n\nFirst, the girl initially declined a date but kept seeing each other at events. Then she randomly reached out four times to have dinner, each time canceling the same day. The author finally got fed up and confronted her, leading to an apology where she mentioned her anxiety. The latest attempt, she wanted to make dinner at his house but backed out again, and the author told her off.\n\nHmm, from the author's perspective, they're a busy person and feel their time is being wasted. They tried to be understanding, but after multiple cancellations, it's reasonable to feel frustrated. The girl is initiating the plans each time, so she's the one making commitments she can't keep. The author did give her chances and even tried to adjust (suggesting going out instead of her coming over). When she still can't follow through, the author sets a boundary, which is a normal thing to do in any relationship.\n\nThe key points here: The author was polite and understanding, gave multiple opportunities, and only acted after repeated no-shows. The girl's anxiety is a valid reason for her behavior, but the author isn't responsible for managing her mental health. It's healthy to communicate one's limits. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and standing up for their time.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
