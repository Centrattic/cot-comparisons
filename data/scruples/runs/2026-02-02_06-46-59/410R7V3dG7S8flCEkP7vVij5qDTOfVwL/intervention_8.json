I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girl who repeatedly cancels plans with the author, and after several instances, he confronts her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and relationship issues, which she mentions as reasons for canceling. The author initially responds politely but gets fed up after multiple cancellations and confronts her. The key points here are understanding the girl's mental health issues versus the author's right to his time and boundaries.\n\nThe author says he's busy and feels his time is being wasted. The girl initiates contact multiple times, which might indicate she's seeking connection but struggles with her anxiety. The author handled the first four cancellations with understanding, but after the fourth, he confronts her. His final reaction is to tell her off, saying she shouldn't make plans if she can't commit. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he's allowed to set boundaries. People with anxiety might need more flexibility or support, but it's also valid for the author to feel frustrated. However, the way he handled it\u2014getting angry and cutting her off\u2014might be harsh. He could have tried to be more patient or communicated his feelings without being dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's repeated cancellations without considering his time could be seen as inconsiderate, even if her anxiety is a valid struggle. The author's right to his time is important. So, there's a balance between empathy and personal boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. If he was polite and explained his feelings, maybe he's justified. But since he did get angry and called her out in a way that might have been hurtful, maybe he's not entirely in the right. The answer might hinge on whether his reaction was proportionate. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's not wrong for setting boundaries. However, there's a nuance in how he communicated it. But overall, it's okay to prioritize your time and express that without being inconsiderate. The girl's anxiety is valid, but she also needs to take responsibility for her actions. The author isn't wrong for being upset.\n"
