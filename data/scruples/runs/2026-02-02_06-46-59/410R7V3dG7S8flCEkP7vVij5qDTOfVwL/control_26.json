I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author asked a girl out, and she declined but they still saw each other at events. The girl then messaged him four times to go out for dinner, each time cancelling the day of. After the fourth cancellation, the author politely told her he values his time and didn't appreciate being treated that way. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then she invited herself over again, and when he suggested going out instead, she wanted to stay home. The author finally told her off, saying he was insulted and that she should not make plans if she can't handle it.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and seems to have issues with relationships, which can make it hard for her to follow through. The author is dealing with repeated cancellations, which is frustrating, especially if he's busy. The key points here are communication and boundaries.\n\nThe author tried to be understanding after the first four cancellations. He didn't lash out initially and even accepted her apology. The fifth time, when she again made plans and wanted to stay home, he called her out. It's important to note that the girl initiated all the plans, which might imply she's the one setting expectations. However, the author also has the right to his time and feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling upset? Probably not. People have a right to be respected and not treated as available on a whim. However, the way he handled it could be a factor. He said he \"pretty much told her off,\" which might have been harsh. But he did mention it was a polite text initially, and the final message was about his feelings of being insulted.\n\nThe girl's behavior is clearly problematic with her anxiety, but if she keeps initiating plans, she should be able to commit. The author isn't obligated to accommodate her anxiety beyond a reasonable point. It's a balance between empathy and self-respect. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries after repeated issues. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
