I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who keeps asking him out, then canceling last minute. He finally tells her off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy says he's busy and values his time. He tried to be polite each time she canceled, but after four times, he got fed up. When she asked again, he said no more. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she mentioned. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe author argues he's not taking it personally but is upset because she keeps initiating and then canceling. He's setting boundaries, which is understandable. People have the right to their time. However, he did respond with frustration, calling her a \"monkey who can dance whenever she wants,\" which is a bit harsh. But he also apologized and tried to be polite initially.\n\nThe girl's behavior is problematic because repeatedly making plans and canceling last minute is inconsiderate. She might have anxiety, but that doesn't excuse the pattern. However, he could have handled it more calmly. He did have a right to feel disrespected, especially after multiple times.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he did communicate his feelings, but maybe in a more emotional way. However, he had a right to set boundaries. The girl's part is also inconsiderate. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's frustration is valid, but his tone might have been harsh. However, considering the repeated cancellations, his reaction is somewhat justified. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
