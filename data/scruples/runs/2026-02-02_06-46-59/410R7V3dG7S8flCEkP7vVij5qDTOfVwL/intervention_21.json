I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting a girl who canceled plans multiple times. \n\nFirst, the girl initiated contact four times, each time asking for a dinner date, and canceled each time on the day of. The author then sends a polite message about valuing their time. She apologizes and explains anxiety issues. Then she calls again, suggests another dinner, and again cancels when it comes to it.\n\nThe author then gets fed up and confronts her, saying they're insulted and that she should not make plans if she can't handle it. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety, which can be a valid reason for canceling. The author might be understanding but also has their own time to consider. Repeated cancellations can be frustrating, and the author's time is valuable. However, the author did give her chances and was polite before getting angry. \n\nThe key points: The author tried being understanding, but after multiple instances, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The girl kept initiating, which might imply she's okay with making plans, but then cancels. The author's reaction, while maybe a bit harsh, is about communication and setting limits. \n\nIs it wrong to feel upset? Probably not. People have limits. The author isn't attacking her anxiety but stating that repeated no-shows are disrespectful. So maybe the author is justified. But there's also the aspect of being patient with someone's mental health issues. \n\nHowever, after four cancellations, it's reasonable to address the pattern. The author did try to be understanding initially. The final response was direct but not malicious. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're protecting their own time and setting boundaries, which is acceptable.\n"
