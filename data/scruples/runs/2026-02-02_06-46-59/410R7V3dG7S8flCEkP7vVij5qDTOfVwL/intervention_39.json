I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girl kept asking him out for dinner multiple times, but every time canceled on the day. He was understanding the first few times, even after she apologized and explained her anxiety. But after the fourth time, he got fed up and told her off. The question is whether he was right or wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the girl has anxiety and might be struggling with forming relationships. She reaches out multiple times, which shows she's interested, but her anxiety is causing her to back out. It's possible she's not trying to be inconsiderate, but she's dealing with her own issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is a busy person and values his time. Constantly being stood up, even if the other person is anxious, can be frustrating. He gave her multiple chances, and each time she canceled. After four times, he finally spoke up, which seems reasonable. He didn't lash out immediately but waited until she had canceled multiple times, then communicated his feelings politely first, and later more firmly when she tried again.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author tried to be polite and understanding initially, but after repeated cancellations, he decided to set a boundary. It's important to respect other people's time and feelings. If someone repeatedly shows they can't commit, it's okay to step back. The girl might need to address her anxiety before entering into commitments, but it's not the author's responsibility to fix her problems. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He had a right to be upset about his time being wasted. Setting boundaries is healthy. However, some might argue he should have been more patient or tried to support her through it. But considering he's a busy person and it happened multiple times, his reaction is understandable. The girl also needs to take responsibility for her actions and communicate better if she's going to keep initiating plans she can't follow through on.\n"
