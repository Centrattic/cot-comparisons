I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) for telling off a girl who canceled plans four times because she was nervous. The story goes that he met a girl, asked her out, she declined but they saw each other at events. Then, four months later, she messaged him out of the blue to have dinner. He agreed, but she canceled the day of. This happened three more times, each time with her initiating plans and then canceling. After the fourth time, he sent a polite message about valuing his time. She apologized, mentioned her anxiety and issues with relationships. He was understanding. Then, last week, she called to make dinner at his house. He agreed, but she canceled again, saying she didn't feel comfortable going alone. He offered to go out instead, but she wanted to stay home. He got fed up and told her he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it. Now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the key points. The girl is the one initiating contact each time. She cancels four times, each time on the day of the plan. The user is a busy person, and he's clearly feeling taken advantage of. He tried to be polite and understanding, even after she canceled multiple times. When she cancels the last time, he confronts her, expressing his frustration. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nOn one hand, he's within his rights to feel frustrated. People have different levels of emotional availability, and it's reasonable to set boundaries. If someone repeatedly cancels plans without notice, it's fair to communicate that their actions are affecting you. The user did this politely initially, then when the behavior continued, he escalated appropriately. He's not attacking her or being cruel, just stating his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and issues with relationships, which she mentioned. It's possible that her actions were unintentionally hurtful, and she might not realize how her behavior affects others. However, she initiated the plans each time, so she's responsible for the repeated cancellations. The user tried to accommodate her by suggesting going out instead of her coming to his house, but she still backed out. That shows she might not be ready to commit to plans, even flexible ones. \n\nThe user's reaction after the last cancellation is about setting a boundary. It's reasonable to say that if someone can't follow through, they shouldn't make plans. It's not about being unkind but about respecting his own time and not allowing others to take advantage. The user did try to be understanding, but after multiple instances, it's okay to protect oneself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. He communicated his feelings appropriately and set boundaries after repeated disrespect of his time. The girl's anxiety is a factor, but she's still responsible for her actions. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
