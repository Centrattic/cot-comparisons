I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation involves a guy who has a girl cancel on him multiple times. They initially met, she declined a date, but they saw each other at events. Then, she messaged him four times to plan dinners or a home-cooked meal, each time canceling on the day. After the fourth cancellation, he politely told her he values his time, she apologized, mentioning anxiety issues. Later, when she initiates again, she cancels again but with a different reason, leading the guy to confront her and tell her off.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for getting upset and confronting her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, from the guy's perspective, being canceled multiple times is frustrating. He's a busy person, and his time is valuable. People do have anxiety and valid reasons for canceling, but repeatedly making plans and then backing out could be seen as inconsiderate, even if there's an underlying issue. The guy did try to be understanding, even after the first four cancellations, but after the fifth attempt (the last one), he had enough. \n\nThe girl's pattern of behavior might indicate she's not ready for commitment or has severe anxiety that affects her ability to engage in plans. However, she keeps initiating contact, which the guy might interpret as leading him on. The key point here is consent and mutual respect in planning. If she's not able to follow through, maybe she shouldn't be making plans in the first place. \n\nThe guy's response was to tell her off, which might be harsh, but he was within his right to express his frustration. It's about setting boundaries. People have different thresholds for what's acceptable, and while the girl's anxiety is valid, the guy isn't obligated to accommodate her every time. \n\nNow, considering whether he's in the wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B). If the answer is A, it would mean the guy was wrong to confront her because he should have been more patient or understanding. If B, then he's justified in his reaction because her actions were inconsiderate and manipulative.\n\nI think it's a balance. The guy had a right to be upset after multiple cancellations, especially when the girl kept initiating plans. However, his response of \"telling her off\" might have been a bit strong, but the situation was built up over several instances. The girl's actions could be seen as using him as a crutch for her anxiety without considering his time. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
