I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the girl keeps asking the author out, but cancels each time on the day. The author finally gets fed up and confronts her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had four instances where the girl canceled last minute. That's a lot. The author tried to be polite each time and even gave her the benefit of the doubt after the fourth time. But when she cancels again, this time with a different reason, the author gets upset and tells her off. \n\nThe girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she explained. The author acknowledges that but also has his own feelings about his time. People have the right to set boundaries. If someone keeps using your time without considering your feelings, it's reasonable to step back. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did confront her in a polite way initially. But when he finally says he's fed up, is that wrong? Maybe not. It's about mutual respect. The girl kept initiating plans, so she might have expected the author to keep showing up despite her cancellations. But the author has a right to feel disrespected if his time is being wasted. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author overreact? The girl's anxiety is a valid issue, but she kept making plans she couldn't keep. The author's time is valuable, and his reaction is about protecting his own boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had a right to set boundaries after multiple instances. The girl should have considered the impact of her actions on the author's time and feelings.\n"
