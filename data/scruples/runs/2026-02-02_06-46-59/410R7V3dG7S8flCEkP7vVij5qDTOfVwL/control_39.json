I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled their plans multiple times due to nervousness. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe girl approached the author four times, each time making plans and then canceling on the day. The author initially responded politely, but after the fourth time, they expressed frustration about their time being wasted. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety and issues with relationships. The author was understanding then. But when the fifth time happened, the author got fed up and confronted her, saying they were insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong to react that way. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the girl's anxiety is a valid issue. Chronic anxiety can make it hard to commit to plans, even if they're initiated by the person. The author was patient for four times, which shows some understanding. However, the fifth time, when she canceled again, the author had had enough. It's important to respect each other's boundaries. The author is also human and has the right to feel that their time is being disrespected. But did they overreact?\n\nThe author's reaction was to tell her off, which might be seen as harsh, especially after she had apologized and explained her issues. However, the author also acknowledged they shouldn't take it personally. It's a balance between empathy and self-respect. The key points here are that the girl initiated all the plans, so she's the one making commitments, and the author is within their right to stop if they feel their time isn't valued. But the way the author expressed their frustration might have been abrupt after the girl's apology.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have anxiety and might need more understanding. But it's also okay to set boundaries. The author's final message was pretty direct, but they did mention they were understanding before. It's possible that the author did the right thing in standing up for themselves, especially if they felt their time was being wasted. However, maybe they could have communicated their feelings more calmly instead of snapping. But considering the repeated cancellations, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they tried to be patient and understanding, but eventually had to set a boundary. However, the way they expressed their feelings could be seen as harsh. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and they did mention trying to be polite and understanding, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). The key is that both parties have valid points, but the author's reaction was a result of consistent behavior from the other person.\n"
