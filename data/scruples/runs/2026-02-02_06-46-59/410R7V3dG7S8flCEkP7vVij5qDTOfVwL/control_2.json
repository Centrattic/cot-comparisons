I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl who keeps asking the author out for dinner, cancels each time, and the author finally gets fed up and confronts her.\n\nFirst, the girl initially said no to a date but they still saw each other. Then she messaged out of the blue four times, each time making plans but canceling the day of. The author was polite the first time, but after four cancellations, he got upset. The last time, she wanted to come to his house but then changed her mind again, so he told her off.\n\nHmm. The author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. The girl has anxiety and issues with relationships. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset and confronting her.\n\nOn one hand, the girl has mental health issues and anxiety. People with anxiety might struggle with making plans and then backing out. The author could be more understanding. But on the other hand, it's reasonable to expect that if someone makes plans, they should follow through or communicate better. The author is within his rights to feel disrespected if plans are canceled repeatedly without clear notice or consideration for his time.\n\nThe author did handle the first few cancellations politely, but after four times, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The final confrontation was because the girl changed plans again, so he expressed his feelings. It's important to consider that while being understanding is good, there's also a balance between empathy and respecting one's own time and feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The girl might need more support, but the author isn't wrong for feeling upset. It's a mutual issue where the girl's anxiety affects her ability to commit, but the author has the right to not be treated as a doormat. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
