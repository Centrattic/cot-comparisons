I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to nervousness. The author set up a scenario where the girl reached out four times, each time canceling on the day. After the fourth time, he told her he values his time and doesn't appreciate her wasting it. She apologized, said she has anxiety, and he let it go. Then she asked again, and when she canceled again, he got fed up and told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girl initiated all the plans, which might mean she's the one seeking connection. But she keeps canceling, which is frustrating for the author. He's a busy person and might feel his time is being disrespected. However, she mentioned having anxiety and issues forming relationships, which is a valid reason for her cancellations. The author tried to be polite initially, gave her the benefit of the doubt, and even adjusted plans when possible.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The author set a boundary when he told her he values his time and doesn't appreciate the cancellations. She did apologize but then repeated the behavior. The author's final response was to tell her he's insulted and that if she has problems, she shouldn't make plans. The question is whether he's in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nOn one hand, he's justified in feeling disrespected because she's not showing up despite initiating plans. On the other hand, she's struggling with anxiety, which isn't his fault. However, repeatedly canceling without notice can be seen as inconsiderate. The author did give her multiple chances and tried to accommodate. His frustration is understandable given the repeated cancellations. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether his response was proportionate. He did communicate his feelings calmly at first, then after another cancellation, he expressed his frustration. It's reasonable for him to set a boundary after multiple instances of being stood up. So, he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
