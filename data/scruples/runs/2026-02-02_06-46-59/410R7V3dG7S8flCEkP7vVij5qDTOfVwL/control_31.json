I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a guy keeps being stood up by a girl four times after she randomly messages him to go out. Each time she cancels last minute, and he eventually gets fed up and tells her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she apologized for. He says he understands but also feels his time is being wasted. So the main points are about boundaries, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nThe girl initiated contact each time, which means she must have felt some level of interest. If she couldn't follow through, maybe she should have communicated better or not made plans if she wasn't sure. But she did explain her anxiety, so maybe she's struggling with that. However, repeated no-shows without considering the other person's time can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author kept being polite and gave her chances. After four times, he finally stood up for himself. It's reasonable to feel frustrated. People have the right to set boundaries. It's not wrong to ask for respect for your time, especially when someone keeps making plans and canceling last minute. The girl's actions might be unintentional, but they still have consequences.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overreacted. He did address it politely the first time and then when it happened again, he expressed his feelings. It's about mutual respect. If someone repeatedly cancels without a valid reason, it's fair to ask for some accountability. The girl's anxiety is a valid issue, but maybe she should seek support to manage it rather than relying on others to accommodate her every time.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself and his time. People can't be expected to tolerate repeated disrespect, even if it's unintentional. The answer should be B, No.\n"
