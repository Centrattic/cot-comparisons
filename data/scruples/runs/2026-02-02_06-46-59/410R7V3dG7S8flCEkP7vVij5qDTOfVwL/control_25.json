I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it clearly.\n\nThe author met a girl who initially wasn't interested in a date but they still saw each other at functions. Then, over four or five months, she randomly messaged him four times to go to dinner or have her come over. Each time, she canceled on the day. The author was polite the first few times, but after the fourth time, he told her he valued his time and didn't appreciate her wasting it. She apologized, explaining she has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. The author said it was okay.\n\nThen, last week, she called to make dinner at his place again. He agreed. When she canceled again, he offered to go out instead, but she said she wanted to stay home. At this point, the author was fed up and told her he was insulted and she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle her anxiety.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The girl is initiating plans but canceling last-minute, four times. The author is a busy person. He's polite initially, gives her the benefit of the doubt, and even after the fourth time, he's understanding when she offers an explanation. However, when she does it again, he confronts her, and the key point is his reaction: he tells her he's insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle her issues.\n\nNow, is it reasonable for the author to feel wronged? Well, the girl is repeatedly making commitments she can't keep, which is disrespectful to the author's time. The author tried to be patient and understanding, but after multiple instances, he's within his rights to express frustration. However, his final message might come off as harsh. He called her out on treating him like a \"monkey who can dance whenever she wants,\" which is a metaphor that could be seen as demeaning. He also told her she \"shouldn't make plans\" if she can't handle her problems, which might be taking responsibility off her and putting it on her anxiety. But her anxiety is a personal issue, and while it's valid, it doesn't mean she can't take responsibility for her actions. However, it's also possible that his frustration is justified, given the repeated cancellations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a chance to communicate his feelings politely before, and after her apology, he was understanding. The final straw came after another cancellation. The question is whether his response was in the wrong. If he was clear about his boundaries and expressed his feelings without being abusive, then he's not wrong. However, if his tone was unkind or dismissive of her struggles, that could be an issue.\n\nThe key here is that the author did give her multiple chances and only after repeated no-shows did he confront her. His frustration is understandable. The way he communicated his feelings might have been harsh, but if he was direct and set a boundary, that's reasonable. The girl's behavior is objectively disrespectful, so the author isn't in the wrong for defending his time and setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
