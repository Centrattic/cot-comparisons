I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl asked the author out four times, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite when it happened the first few times but after the fourth time, they sent a firm message about valuing their time. Then, when she asked again, she canceled again because she wasn't comfortable. The author then confronted her, saying they were fed up and told her she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the author's perspective is that they're being treated like they can be summoned any time, which is disrespectful. They have a right to their time and to set boundaries. The girl's side is that she has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which is a valid reason for canceling. But she kept initiating plans despite her issues, which might mean she wasn't being honest with herself or the author from the start.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. Let me consider both sides. The girl's anxiety is a real issue, but if she's not able to commit to plans, maybe she shouldn't be making them in the first place. The author has the right to be upset about their time being wasted, especially after multiple instances. However, the author's response was to confront her in a way that might not have been entirely constructive. Instead of just being upset, maybe they could have communicated their feelings more clearly and set boundaries earlier.\n\nBut wait, the author did try to be polite initially. After the fourth cancellation, they politely expressed their concerns. Then when the fifth happened, they reacted more strongly. The girl's actions were inconsistent\u2014initiating plans but not following through. The author's frustration is understandable. They have a right to stand up for themselves. The key point is whether the author's response was proportionate. Telling her not to make plans if she can't handle it is a clear boundary. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary, especially after repeated cancellations.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it with more empathy, but the situation shows that the girl's behavior was a pattern. The author isn't to blame for feeling disrespected. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
