I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the girl initially declined a date but they stayed in touch. Then, she messaged him four times to make plans, but canceled each time on the day. The author was polite the first time, then after the fourth cancellation, he told her he valued his time and didn't appreciate her wasting it. She apologized, mentioned her anxiety and relationship issues. He was understanding but then when she tried again, she canceled again, and he got fed up and confronted her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, the girl has anxiety, which is a valid reason for her cancellations. She initiated contact each time, so she's the one making plans. People with anxiety might struggle with commitment, so maybe it's not entirely her fault. But on the other hand, the author is a busy person and his time is valuable. Repeated cancellations without notice can be frustrating. The author's response after the fourth time was to set a boundary, which seems reasonable. He even tried to be understanding by suggesting alternatives. However, when she canceled again, he expressed his frustration. \n\nIs it wrong to feel upset? Probably not. People have limits, and it's okay to communicate that. But was his reaction appropriate? He did it in a way that was direct but not hostile. He explained his feelings and set a boundary. The key here is mutual respect. The girl kept initiating plans, which implies she's interested, but her anxiety is causing issues. The author isn't obligated to keep accommodating if it's causing him stress. \n\nSo, considering both sides, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He tried to be understanding and even offered alternatives, but his feelings are valid. It's okay to set boundaries when someone's actions repeatedly affect you negatively. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
