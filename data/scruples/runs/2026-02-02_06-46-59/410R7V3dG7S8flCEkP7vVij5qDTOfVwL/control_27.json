I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author kept getting asked out by this girl, who then canceled each time. First, they had a first date that she canceled. Then three more times, same pattern. The author finally told her off, saying he values his time and doesn't want it wasted. She apologized, explaining her anxiety. Then she tried again, but canceled again, and the author got fed up and told her off again. Now he's questioning if he was wrong to feel upset or take it personally.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. Let's think about both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. That's a valid struggle, and people with anxiety might have trouble following through on plans because of their mental health. But on the other hand, the author is a busy person who has the right to value his time. Repeatedly canceling plans without proper communication can be disrespectful, even if it's due to anxiety.\n\nEach time she cancels, the author is left in limbo. Even though she apologized and explained her anxiety, the pattern continued. The author's frustration is understandable. He's not obligated to keep accommodating someone who can't commit to plans they keep making. The final straw was when she canceled again, and he expressed his feelings about it. \n\nBut wait, did he give her enough support? Maybe he could have tried to find a compromise, like meeting in a less intimidating environment. However, after four cancellations, it's reasonable for him to set boundaries. The problem is balancing empathy with personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset because his time is important, and repeated no-shows can be seen as dismissive. The girl should communicate better if she's going to make plans, and if she can't handle the commitment, maybe she shouldn't make the plans in the first place.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had the right to set boundaries after repeated cancellations, especially when it's affecting his time and schedule. The girl's anxiety is a factor, but mutual respect requires both parties to communicate and follow through.\n"
