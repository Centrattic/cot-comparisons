I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy has this girl who keeps asking him out, but then cancels on the day of the plans four times. The first time, he's understanding, but after the fourth time, he confronts her. She apologizes and explains her anxiety. He's okay with it, but then she suggests another plan, which she also cancels again. Then he gets fed up and tells her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety, which can make social interactions really tough. She's reaching out, which shows she's trying, but her anxiety is causing her to back out. The guy is a busy person and his time is valuable. He's being respectful initially, but after repeated cancellations, he's frustrated. \n\nIs the guy wrong for being upset? Well, he's not obligated to keep accommodating her if it's causing him stress. People have a right to their time and boundaries. The girl's anxiety is a real issue, but she's making plans she can't keep, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, she's not doing it maliciously; it's due to her mental health struggles.\n\nThe guy's response was to tell her off after the fourth time. Was that the right approach? Maybe he could have communicated his feelings earlier, but he did try to be polite. The key here is whether his reaction was justified. He's not attacking her personally but stating that her actions are affecting him. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl should probably be more upfront about her anxiety before making plans. But she has been, after the fourth time, and he was understanding. Then she cancels again, which is a fifth time. Maybe the guy is right to set a boundary here. It's about mutual respect. If someone can't commit to plans, it's okay to step back.\n\nSo, considering all that, the guy isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and setting boundaries. His time is valid, and he's not responsible for fixing her anxiety. The answer is B.\n"
