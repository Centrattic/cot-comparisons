I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled multiple times. First, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nThe girl initially asked him out, but he declined. Then she randomly messaged him four times over a few months to plan dinners or cooking sessions at his place. Each time, she canceled the day of. The author was polite the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, he sent a message about valuing his time. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety and relationship issues. He was understanding but still let it go. \n\nThen, the fifth time, she wanted to come over, but canceled again, not even coming. The author, now frustrated, told her off, saying he felt insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she has anxiety issues. The question is whether he was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, looking at the facts: The girl initiated contact multiple times, which shows she was interested in some way. However, she canceled each time, which could be due to anxiety. The author tried to be understanding, even after multiple cancellations. But after the fifth time, he snapped. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he's a busy person and his time matters. Repeated no-shows can be frustrating. He handled it politely initially, but after several instances, his frustration is understandable. However, when she finally proposed a plan and he agreed, she canceled again. His response was to confront her, which might be seen as necessary communication. \n\nBut was his reaction too harsh? He did mention he felt insulted, which could come off as accusatory. Maybe a better approach was to set boundaries earlier. However, given the pattern, his feelings are valid. He's not obligated to keep accommodating her cancellations. So, he's not in the wrong for expressing his feelings, especially after multiple instances. The answer should be B (No).\n"
