I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe girl in question canceled plans four times. The author was initially polite, even after the fourth cancellation, but then got fed up and confronted her. The user is asking if they're at fault for getting upset and telling her off.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girl's actions. She kept initiating plans but canceled each time. Each time, she might have her reasons, like anxiety or relationship issues. But from the author's perspective, his time is being wasted repeatedly. That's a valid concern. People value their time, especially if they're busy. It's reasonable to expect that if someone makes plans, they should follow through unless there's a valid reason. However, the girl's anxiety might be a genuine issue, and she might not be intentionally trying to waste his time.\n\nNow, the author's response: After four cancellations, he sent a polite message about valuing his time. Then, when the fifth plan was made and she had issues again, he got fed up and told her off. The key here is whether his reaction was justified. He's not being aggressive or hostile, but he's standing up for himself. It's important to balance empathy for her anxiety with his own feelings about being respected.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. On one hand, he's defending his time, which is his right. On the other, he might not have given her enough support to overcome her anxiety. But the girl initiated the plans each time, so she's responsible for following through. The author isn't forcing her to make plans; she's the one who keeps suggesting them.\n\nI think the author's main issue is that he's being respectful but also setting boundaries. He tried to be understanding and polite each time, but after repeated cancellations, he's justified in feeling upset. The fact that she's the one initiating might mean she has a higher responsibility to follow through. However, if she has anxiety, maybe she needs more support, but the author isn't obligated to provide that support if it's affecting him negatively.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's setting boundaries, which is important. People can have anxiety, but they also need to be considerate of others' time. If someone keeps canceling, it's reasonable to express frustration and decide not to engage further. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
