I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if they're at fault for getting upset with a girl who canceled plans multiple times because she was nervous. \n\nFirst, the girl initially declined a date but kept seeing the author at functions. Then she randomly reached out four times for dinner plans, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite the first few times but got fed up after the fourth cancellation. They sent a polite message about valuing their time, and the girl apologized, explaining anxiety and relationship issues. The author was understanding but later got another cancellation for a home visit, leading them to confront the girl and tell her off.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. The author is a busy person and has the right to value their time. The girl's repeated cancellations, especially after making plans, could be disrespectful. People with anxiety might struggle with commitments, but it's important they communicate better or not make plans if they can't commit. The author setting a boundary here by expressing their feelings is reasonable. However, the girl initiating all the plans might mean she has some responsibility in the dynamic, but the author also has the right to set limits.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Maybe not. It's okay to feel frustrated when someone repeatedly cancels. The key is how they handled it. The author was initially polite, gave the girl space, and only confronted after multiple incidents. Their final message was about setting a boundary, which is necessary for self-respect. The girl's anxiety isn't an excuse for repeated cancellations without proper communication. The author isn't obligated to accommodate someone's anxiety indefinitely if it's affecting their own time and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, could the author have been more understanding? Perhaps by offering alternative arrangements or being more flexible. But the girl didn't take the initial polite warning seriously. The author's final response was a necessary step to protect their time. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because they set appropriate boundaries after repeated disrespect.\n"
