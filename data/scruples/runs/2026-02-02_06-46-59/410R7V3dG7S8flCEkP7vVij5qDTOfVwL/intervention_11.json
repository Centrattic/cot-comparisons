I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who kept canceling plans with the author, and after several instances, he confronts her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author met a girl who initially declined a dinner date but saw each other at events. Then, four times, she messaged him out of the blue to plan something, but canceled the same day each time. After the fourth time, he told her politely about valuing his time. She apologized, explained her anxiety. Then, she asked to come over for dinner again, he agreed, but she canceled again, saying she wasn't comfortable alone. He offered alternatives, but she wanted to stay home. Then he told her he was insulted and that if she can't handle her anxiety, she shouldn't make plans.\n\nSo, the author is frustrated with repeated cancellations and finally confronts her. The question is whether he was wrong to do so. The user thinks he is in the wrong. \n\nNow, I need to analyze both sides. The girl has anxiety and is struggling to form relationships. She initiated the plans each time, which shows she wanted to connect, but her anxiety led to last-minute cancellations. The author, on the other hand, is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. He gave her chances, even after she apologized, and when she canceled again, he expressed his frustration. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author did try to be polite initially, but after multiple incidents, it's reasonable to set boundaries. People with anxiety might need more flexibility, but there's a limit to how much someone should accommodate another's repeated cancellations. The author's frustration is understandable. However, the way he responded (\"insulted\" and implying she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it) might be harsh, but considering the pattern of behavior, it's a valid reaction. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The author has the right to feel his time is important. The girl's actions, while due to her mental health issues, are still causing repeated inconvenience. The author isn't attacking her mental health but stating that he can't keep allowing his time to be wasted. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after multiple instances. He was patient, gave her multiple chances, and only after that took action. \n\nThe user said they think the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the author is justified in his response. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
