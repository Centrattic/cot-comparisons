I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who repeatedly cancels dinner plans she initiates, and the author eventually tells her off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was asked out before but declined, then the girl started initiating plans. She canceled four times, each time on the day of. The author finally sent a polite message about valuing their time, and the girl apologized, explaining anxiety. The latest time, she wanted to come over but then canceled again, and the author felt insulted and confronted her more strongly.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they're busy, the girl keeps initiating plans but cancels last-minute, leading to frustration. They communicated their feelings politely after the fourth cancellation and even offered alternatives, but the girl still canceled. The author is conflicted between understanding her anxiety and feeling used.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. So, I need to assess if the author overstepped. The author didn't lash out; they were polite and set boundaries. The girl's behavior might be a pattern of not following through, which is valid to address. The author's response was to express their feelings when they felt their time was being wasted. Setting boundaries when someone repeatedly cancels isn't unreasonable. The girl's anxiety is a valid reason, but if she can't commit to plans, it's fair for the author to question her decisions. The author's frustration is justified given the repeated cancellations. The final confrontation was about their feelings of being treated disrespectfully, not attacking her personal issues. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They handled it respectfully, communicated their boundaries, and acted when the pattern continued. The girl's actions were the issue, not the author's response. The answer should be B.\n"
