  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling off a girl who canceled plans because she was too nervous?\nPlease read before you rip me apart.\n\nI met this girl who seemed nice enough. I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl initially declined a date but they kept seeing each other at events. Then she messaged him four times to make plans, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, he sent a polite message about valuing his time. She apologized, mentioned her anxiety and relationship issues. He said it was okay. Then she called again, made another plan, canceled again, and he got fed up, told her off.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here: the girl has anxiety and relationship issues. She's the one initiating contact each time, which shows she's interested but then cancels. The author is frustrated with his time being wasted, which is understandable. He did try to be understanding and polite, even after multiple cancellations. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might need support, but she's not reciprocating the effort. The author's reaction after the fifth time was to express his feelings, which is his right. He's not obligated to keep accommodating someone who can't commit. The girl's behavior is inconsiderate, even if she has issues. It's a balance between empathy and self-respect. The author didn't lash out, just communicated his frustration. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
