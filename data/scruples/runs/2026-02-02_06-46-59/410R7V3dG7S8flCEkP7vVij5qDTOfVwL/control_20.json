I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author met a girl who initially turned down his invitation but they saw each other at events. Then, she randomly asked to have dinner four times, each time canceling on the day. The author tried to be polite, even after the fourth cancellation, but finally got fed up and told her off. Now, the question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships. She's reaching out, which shows some level of trust or interest. But she keeps canceling last minute, which affects the author's time. The author, after multiple cancellations, set a boundary, which seems reasonable. But is there a point where he should have stopped responding earlier?\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author kept accepting the invitations each time, even after the previous cancellations. Maybe he could have communicated his discomfort earlier. However, after four times, it's understandable to feel frustrated. People have limits on their time and patience. The author's final response was direct but not hostile, just expressing his feelings and setting a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might need support, but if she's not ready to commit to plans, making them might not be fair to others. However, the author's reaction was after multiple instances. The question is whether his reaction is justified. Since he gave her the benefit of the doubt each time and finally addressed it after the fourth cancellation, I think he's within his rights to be upset. He's not in the wrong for setting a boundary, especially considering his own time and feelings. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
