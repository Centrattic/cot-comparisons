I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting the girl who kept canceling their plans. The situation involves the girl asking to meet up multiple times but then canceling each time. The author finally sends a polite message about valuing their time, and after another cancellation, confronts the girl.\n\nFirst, the girl's actions: She initiated contact four times, each time leading to a cancellation. The author is a busy person and feels their time is being wasted. The author tried to be understanding, even after the first four cancellations, giving the benefit of the doubt when the girl explained her anxiety. However, the fifth time, she again cancels, and the author feels fed up.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The girl is using the author's time repeatedly, knowing she might cancel. The author is within their rights to express frustration, especially after multiple instances. The author did give her chances to explain and was patient. The final confrontation, while maybe a bit harsh in tone, is a response to repeated disrespect of their time. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and relationship issues, which might be a valid reason for her cancellations. But she did initiate the plans each time, so she's responsible for the follow-through. The author isn't obligated to accommodate her every time without reciprocation. The author's right to set boundaries is important. They don't have to take it personally, but it's reasonable to feel upset about being treated with disrespect.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. The girl's actions were the problem, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
