  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling off a girl who canceled plans because she was too nervous?\nPlease read before you rip me apart.\n\nI met this girl who seemed nice enough. I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting the girl who kept canceling their plans. \n\nFirst, the girl initiated contact four times, each time making plans and then canceling on the day. The author was polite the first few times but got fed up after the fourth cancellation. He sent a polite message about valuing his time, and she apologized, explaining her anxiety. Then she tried again, and when he offered alternatives, she still couldn't commit. The author then told her off, saying he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she disclosed. But she's the one initiating contact repeatedly, which shows she wants to engage. However, each time she cancels, which might be due to her anxiety. The author is busy and feels his time is being wasted. He's frustrated but tried to be understanding initially. When she cancels again, he confronts her, which is a reasonable response after multiple instances.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, he's within his rights to feel frustrated. People with anxiety might struggle with commitments, but that doesn't mean others should tolerate repeated cancellations without setting boundaries. The author tried to be polite and understanding, but after multiple times, it's reasonable to express his feelings. The key here is whether his reaction was proportionate. He didn't lash out angrily but communicated his feelings clearly. The girl's actions (initiating and then canceling) might be part of her healing process, but the author also has the right to set limits. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
