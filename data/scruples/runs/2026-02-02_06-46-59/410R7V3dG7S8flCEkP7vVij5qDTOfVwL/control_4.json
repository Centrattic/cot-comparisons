I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for confronting a girl who kept canceling plans due to anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy was asked out by a girl who initially declined a dinner date but then kept initiating plans four more times, each time canceling on the day. After the fourth cancellation, he politely told her he values his time. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then, she asked to come to his house again, and when he offered alternatives, she said she didn't feel comfortable. He then got fed up and confronted her.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for feeling upset and confronting her. Let me break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the girl has anxiety and mental health issues, which are valid and can affect her ability to commit to plans. The author was understanding initially, even after the first four cancellations. He tried to be accommodating by offering alternatives when she canceled the fifth time.\n\nOn the other hand, repeatedly making plans and canceling them can be frustrating for anyone, especially if it's affecting the person's schedule and time. The author is busy and has a right to feel that his time is being disrespected. It's reasonable to set boundaries, especially after multiple instances.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The girl's actions, while influenced by her anxiety, might be seen as inconsiderate. The author's response was to communicate his feelings clearly and set a boundary, which is a healthy approach. He didn't lash out or be rude; he expressed his feelings and expectations. \n\nBut wait, the girl is initiating all the contact. She might be testing the waters due to her anxiety, but each time she cancels, it's a pattern. The author is within his rights to feel that it's not worth continuing if he's not respected. However, could he have handled it differently? Maybe by having an earlier conversation when the pattern started? But he did try to be patient and understanding, and after multiple times, it's reasonable to take a stand.\n\nAnother angle: the girl's anxiety is a real issue, but she should communicate her needs better. The author isn't obligated to accommodate her if it's causing him stress. It's about both parties' well-being. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own time and setting limits.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he set boundaries after repeated disrespect to his time and communicated his feelings calmly. It's a mutual issue where both parties have valid points, but the author's actions were justified given the circumstances.\n"
