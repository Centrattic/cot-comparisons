I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So, first, I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author met a girl, asked her out, and she declined but they still saw each other. Then, she messaged him out of the blue to go to dinner four times, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite the first time but got fed up after the fourth time and confronted her. When she proposed another dinner, she canceled again, and the author had enough, telling her off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they're a busy person who values their time. Repeated cancellations can be frustrating, and it's reasonable to feel upset if someone keeps making plans they don't follow through on. The author tried to be understanding initially, giving her the benefit of the doubt, especially when she apologized and explained anxiety issues. But after multiple instances, it's reasonable to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships. She initiated the interactions each time, so she might not have intended to manipulate the author but was struggling with her own issues. However, repeatedly canceling without considering the other person's time can be inconsiderate. The author's frustration is valid because their time is valuable, and they shouldn't be treated as someone who's always available on a whim.\n\nThe key here is about mutual respect. The girl made plans she couldn't keep, which is disrespectful to the author's time. The author communicated their feelings calmly, especially after the fourth cancellation, and then finally set a boundary when she tried to make another plan. The author isn't being cruel; they're standing up for themselves and their time. The girl's actions were the main issue, as she kept initiating plans she couldn't commit to, expecting the author to be patient indefinitely.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to express their feelings and set boundaries. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
