I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong after telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. The situation is that the girl approached him four times, each time making plans that she canceled on the day. After the fourth time, he told her he values his time and doesn't appreciate her wasting it. She apologized, mentioned her anxiety and issues with relationships. Then she tried again, and when he suggested alternatives, she backed out again. The author then confronted her, saying he's insulted and that if she can't handle her anxiety, she shouldn't make plans with him. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girl has an anxiety problem and is trying to form a relationship, but keeps canceling. The author is a busy person and is frustrated with the repeated cancellations. He did give her chances, even after the first four times. His final response was to tell her off, which is the point in question.\n\nOn one hand, the girl has mental health issues and is struggling. It's important to be understanding and patient. But on the other hand, repeatedly making plans and canceling last minute can be seen as disrespectful. The author has a right to feel his time is being wasted. However, the author did respond politely the first time, and the girl did apologize. Then she kept initiating again, and when given alternatives, she still pulled out. So maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to be understanding and polite. The girl's actions kept being inconsistent, and she didn't follow through even when given other options. The author's frustration is valid. However, the way he expressed his feelings might come off as harsh, but given the context, he's setting a boundary. \n\nIs it wrong to feel upset? No, it's reasonable. The question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her off. If he communicated his feelings respectfully, even if he was firm, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girl may have valid reasons, but she also needs to take responsibility for her actions and communicate better. \n\nSo the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries after repeated disrespect to his time, and he did try to be understanding first. However, there's a balance. If he was rude, but the text says he was polite initially. His final message was direct but justified given the pattern.\n"
