I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans four times due to her anxiety. \n\nFirst, the girl initially declined a date but continued to interact. Then she initiated plans four times, each time canceling on the day. The author tried to be understanding, especially after the fourth cancelation where the girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety. The author responded politely but eventually got fed up and confronted her, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The girl might have anxiety issues, which is valid, but repeatedly making plans she can't keep is inconsiderate. The author has the right to value their time and set boundaries. However, the way the author handled the confrontation might matter. They said they were \"pretty fucking fed up\" and told her off, which could be seen as harsh, especially considering her anxiety.\n\nBut on the other hand, the girl kept initiating plans, knowing she might cancel. The author isn't responsible for fixing her anxiety. It's about mutual respect. The author's frustration is understandable given the repeated cancellations. They tried to be polite and understanding, but eventually, it's okay to set limits. The girl's actions were disrespectful, so the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. However, the approach could have been more diplomatic.\n"
