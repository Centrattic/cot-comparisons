I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting the girl who kept canceling their plans.\n\nFirst, the situation: the girl asked the author out four times, each time canceled on the day. After the fourth time, the author told her politely that they value their time and don't like being treated like it's disposable. The girl apologized and explained her anxiety. Then she invited again, and canceled again, this time not wanting to come over. The author got fed up and told her off, saying if she can't handle her anxiety, she shouldn't make plans. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The girl initiated contact multiple times, showing interest in spending time together.\n2. She canceled each time on the day of the event, which can be frustrating for the author.\n3. The author gave polite feedback after the fourth cancellation, which the girl responded to with apologies and explanations about anxiety.\n4. Despite this, she tried again, leading to another cancellation, prompting the author to confront her more strongly.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and mutual respect. The author had the right to feel frustrated, especially since the girl kept initiating plans, which might imply commitment. Cancellations without proper notice can be disrespectful, regardless of the reason. The author communicated their feelings, which is healthy. The girl's anxiety is a valid issue, but repeatedly making plans she can't keep can be seen as selfish if it's causing others distress. However, calling her out harshly after she's already apologized might be crossing a line. The author could have been more empathetic, understanding that anxiety is a real struggle. But the author's right to set boundaries is also valid. It's a balance between empathy and self-respect.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. It's okay to prioritize your time and not tolerate repeated disrespect. On the other hand, the author could have been more patient, perhaps discussing the issue earlier or finding a middle ground. But given that the girl kept initiating, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The girl's actions are problematic because she's making commitments she can't keep, which affects the author. However, the author's final response might have been too harsh, but the initial frustration is justified. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely depends on cultural context and personal boundaries. Since the author tried to communicate politely and then escalated after repeated issues, they're probably not in the wrong. The girl's actions are the main issue here. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
