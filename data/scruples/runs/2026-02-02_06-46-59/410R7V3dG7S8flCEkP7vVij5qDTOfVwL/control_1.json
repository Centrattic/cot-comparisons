I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans because she was too nervous. The situation is that the author was asked out multiple times by the girl, each time she cancels the day of, and after the fourth time, he confronted her. Now she's asked again, and he's fed up and called her out.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The girl initiated the plans four times and canceled each time. The author was polite the first time and then after the fourth, sent a polite message about valuing his time. Then the latest instance, she wanted to come to his house, he offered alternatives, but she insisted on staying home. He told her he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle anxiety.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for feeling upset and confronting her. Well, time is a valuable resource. If someone keeps setting up plans and then canceling, it's reasonable to feel that their time is being disrespected. The author tried to be understanding each time, even after the first cancellation. But after multiple instances, it's understandable that he's frustrated. \n\nHowever, the girl has anxiety and issues with relationships. She apologized and explained her problems. The author acknowledges that, but also feels that she's using him as a \"monkey\" who's always available. The problem here is that she keeps initiating contact despite her anxiety, leading to cancellations. The author is in a position where he's trying to balance being supportive and respecting his own time.\n\nIs it wrong for him to set a boundary? I don't think so. Because after multiple cancellations, he's had enough. It's important to communicate your feelings, especially if you're not being respected. But maybe the way he told her off was harsh? The user says \"pretty much told her\" but the details are that he said he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it. That's a bit direct, but given the context, maybe it's justified. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have been more patient, but the girl's behavior is inconsistent. She keeps reaching out, which might imply she does want to go through with the plans, but her anxiety is causing her to back out. The author might have tried to be the supportive person, but he's not obligated to keep accommodating if it's causing him stress. \n\nSo in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. He's been patient multiple times, and after repeated cancellations, expressing his feelings is reasonable. The girl is responsible for her anxiety and not canceling last minute if she can't handle it. The author's time is important, and he's allowed to feel upset. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
