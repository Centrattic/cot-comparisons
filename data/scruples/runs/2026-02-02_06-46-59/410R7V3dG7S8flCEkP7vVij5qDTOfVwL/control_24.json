I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans four times due to nervousness. The author tried to be polite initially, even after multiple cancellations, but finally snapped because he's busy and feels she's treating his time lightly. The girl apologized and explained her anxiety and issues forming relationships.\n\nSo, first, the girl's actions: she initiated plans four times and canceled each time. That could be frustrating for anyone, especially if it's repeated. The author tried to be understanding and gave her space to apologize. Now, he's telling her off because he's fed up. Is that wrong?\n\nI think the key here is the balance between understanding and self-respect. The girl might have anxiety, which is valid, but repeatedly making plans and then canceling can be disrespectful to the other person's time. The author isn't attacking her issues but is setting a boundary about his time. He's a busy person, so it's reasonable to expect that being canceled on multiple times would be a burden. \n\nThe girl initiated all the plans, so she's the one choosing to make commitments she can't keep. The author's response was direct but he mentioned it was a \"super polite text\" initially, and then he told her he was insulted. However, he's not being cruel, just expressing his frustration. It's not wrong to feel upset when someone keeps treating your time as expendable, even if they have valid reasons. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction is justified. Since he tried to be understanding and she continued the same behavior, it's fair for him to set a boundary. People have to manage their own time and energy, especially if they're busy. The author didn't blame her for having anxiety but said if she can't handle it, she shouldn't make plans. That's a reasonable boundary. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his right to have his time respected after multiple instances of being stood up. While empathy is important, everyone has limits and the right to communicate when those limits are crossed.\n"
