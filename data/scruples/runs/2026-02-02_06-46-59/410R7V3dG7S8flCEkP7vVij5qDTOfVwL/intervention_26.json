I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl who initially declined a dinner invite but they still saw each other at events. Then, four months later, she randomly messages him to go to dinner. He agrees, but she cancels the day of. This happens four times. Each time, he accepts it, but after the fourth cancellation, he tells her politely that he values his time. She apologizes, explaining her anxiety and relationship issues. He accepts her apology. Then, she calls him again to make dinner at his house, but cancels again because she's not comfortable. The author gets fed up and tells her he's insulted and she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it.\n\nHmm, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the girl has anxiety and is struggling with forming relationships. She's reaching out repeatedly, which shows she's interested in some way, but her anxiety is causing her to cancel. The author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. He's polite in his initial response, but eventually snaps when she cancels again. \n\nOn the other hand, repeatedly making plans and canceling might be inconsiderate. Even with anxiety, communication is key. If she can't commit, maybe she should not make the plans. The author has a right to feel disrespected after multiple cancellations. He gave her chances and even tried to accommodate her by suggesting going out instead of her coming to his house. But she still canceled. \n\nThe author's reaction is to tell her he's insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it. Is that too harsh? Well, he's made his feelings known politely before, and she continued the behavior. At some point, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. He's communicated his feelings and given her multiple chances. \n\nBut wait, maybe he should have been more understanding. However, it's also about mutual respect. If someone repeatedly cancels, it's not just about their issues but also about how they treat others. The author isn't trying to fix her problems but to have a respectful interaction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's within his rights to be upset and set boundaries after repeated inconsiderate actions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
