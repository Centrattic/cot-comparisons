I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves someone repeatedly canceling plans, and the author finally getting upset and telling them off.\n\nFirst, the girl initially declined a date but they still saw each other at functions. Then, she messaged out of the blue four times to make dinner plans, each time canceling the same day. The author responded politely the first time, but after the fourth cancellation, they expressed their frustration. The last time, she wanted to make dinner at his house but canceled again, leading the author to confront her about treating his time as disposable.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships, which she mentioned. The author tried to be understanding but has limits. People do get anxious, and sometimes they cancel plans, but doing it multiple times without notice can be frustrating. The author communicated their feelings respectfully, pointing out that their time is valuable. It's important to consider if the author overreacted or if they had the right to set boundaries.\n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in feeling frustrated, especially after four cancellations. Their time is valuable, and constant no-shows can be disrespectful. On the other hand, the girl has anxiety and might be struggling, so maybe the author should be more patient. However, the author did attempt to accommodate her by suggesting alternatives each time. The final confrontation was after multiple instances, so it's about mutual respect. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her off but in a polite manner, explaining their feelings. They didn't lash out, just set a boundary. So, considering that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to expect reliability if they're going to invest their time. The girl's behavior was inconsiderate, even if it's due to anxiety. So the answer is B (No).\n"
