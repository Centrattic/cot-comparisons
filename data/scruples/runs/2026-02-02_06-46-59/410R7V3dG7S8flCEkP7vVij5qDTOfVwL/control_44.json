I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. The situation involves multiple instances where the girl initiates plans, cancels on the day, and then the author finally confronts her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the girl canceled four times after initiating plans. Each time, she had reasons related to anxiety or discomfort. The author felt their time was being wasted and eventually expressed frustration, leading to the question of right or wrong.\n\nThe girl's actions: She initiated contact multiple times, which shows interest. However, she canceled each time, citing personal issues. The author felt disrespected because their time wasn't valued, which is a valid feeling. People do value their time, and repeated cancellations without proper notice can be frustrating.\n\nThe author's response: After four cancellations, they sent a polite message about valuing their time. When the fifth incident happened, they confronted her more strongly. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they are busy and have other commitments. They did give her the benefit of the doubt initially, showing understanding.\n\nThe girl's perspective: She has anxiety and issues forming relationships. She apologized each time. However, she kept initiating plans, possibly without considering the impact of her cancellations. While her mental health is a factor, it's also about mutual respect in communication. If she knew she might cancel, maybe she shouldn't have made the plans in the first place.\n\nNow, considering social norms and empathy. It's important to be understanding of someone's mental health struggles, but there's also the aspect of respecting others' time. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They tried to be polite and understanding but eventually had to communicate their feelings. The girl's actions, while possibly due to anxiety, may have been inconsiderate of the author's time and feelings.\n\nThe author's final response was direct but not necessarily harsh. They explained their feelings and set a boundary, which is a healthy approach. It's not about being right or wrong but about mutual respect. Since the girl kept initiating plans despite knowing her tendency to cancel, the author had the right to express their frustration.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they communicated their feelings appropriately after multiple cancellations and set a boundary, which is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
