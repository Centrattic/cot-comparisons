I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who keeps canceling plans last minute, and the author finally confronts her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author was asked out, and then the girl randomly messaged him four times to make plans, each time canceling the same day. The author felt his time was being wasted and finally told her off. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety and issues with relationships. The author is conflicted between understanding her problems and being upset about the repeated cancellations.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her off. Let's break it down. The girl initiated the plans each time, so she's the one making the commitment. The author was polite the first few times but after four cancellations, he had a right to feel frustrated. People with anxiety might have difficulty following through, but repeatedly committing to plans and then canceling without a valid reason (other than anxiety) can be seen as disrespectful to the other person's time.\n\nThe author's response was to confront her in a polite manner, explaining that he values his time. That seems reasonable. He didn't lash out, just communicated his feelings. The girl's actions led to the author's frustration, so it's not entirely his fault. However, the author could have considered offering support or suggesting alternative plans that might be less stressful for her. But given that the girl initiated each time and the author was trying to accommodate her, maybe he's justified in setting boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have communicated his feelings earlier, rather than letting it build up to four times. But given that he tried to be understanding and only confronted her after multiple issues, it's reasonable. The key point is that the girl kept initiating plans, so the responsibility for the commitments was on her. The author's frustration is valid, and he's not obligated to endlessly accommodate someone who can't commit. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
