I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. The guy set up a few dinner dates, which she canceled each time. He was polite the first time, but after four cancellations, he got fed up and told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girl has anxiety and issues with relationships, which she mentioned. She initiated the plans, so she's the one reaching out each time. The author feels his time is being wasted, which is valid because time is a resource. But on the other hand, she's struggling with mental health issues.\n\nThe author's response after the fourth cancellation was polite, which shows he tried to be understanding. But when she canceled again, this time with a different reason (not feeling comfortable going to his house), he snapped. The key here is whether his reaction was justified. \n\nHe's under no obligation to keep accommodating repeated cancellations, especially if it's affecting his schedule. People have the right to set boundaries. However, the way he reacted\u2014telling her she shouldn't make plans if she has anxiety\u2014might come off as dismissive of her struggles. \n\nBut wait, he also acknowledged her anxiety and said it's not his problem. Still, after multiple instances, his frustration is understandable. It's a balance between empathy and self-respect. He's not in the wrong for standing up for himself, especially since she was the one initiating contact. However, maybe he could have handled it more compassionately, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer seems to be B (No), because he had a right to feel disrespected and set boundaries. It's not his responsibility to work through her problems indefinitely without reciprocity. So he's not in the wrong.\n"
