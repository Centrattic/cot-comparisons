I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The person (AITA) is upset because a girl kept asking them out for dinner, but canceled each time on the day of. After four times, they confronted her politely, and she apologized. Then she asked again, and even after adjusting the plans, they got fed up and told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a busy person and their time is valuable. Repeated cancellations can be frustrating, especially when someone keeps initiating plans. It's reasonable for them to feel disrespected if someone keeps setting up expectations and then canceling. However, the girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which might explain her behavior. She's not just being flaky; she's struggling with emotional issues. The author might have been understanding initially but reached their limit.\n\nBut wait, the author did give her chances each time. She initiated contact four times, so she's the one reaching out. If she's the one making plans and then canceling, maybe she's not respecting the author's time. However, the author's response after the fourth time was polite, but when she asked again and they adjusted the plans, he blew up. Maybe he should have set boundaries earlier? Or is it okay to finally express frustration when it's affecting him negatively?\n\nAlso, the author's final response was to tell her off, which might have been harsh, but considering the repetition, maybe it's justified. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The girl had a valid reason (anxiety), but repeatedly canceling without notice isn't respectful. The author has a right to be upset. However, maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier or set clearer boundaries before the final outburst.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did try to be understanding and even offered alternatives. The girl's anxiety is a legitimate issue, but she's the one making plans she can't keep. The author's time is important, and it's okay to prioritize that. But in his final message, he might have been a bit abrupt. However, given the pattern, maybe it's not the author's fault. The girl is responsible for her own anxiety and the way she's handling it by canceling repeatedly. The author is within his rights to stop engaging if it's causing him stress.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He tried to be understanding, gave her multiple chances, and finally set a boundary when it became too much. The girl's actions were problematic, so the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
