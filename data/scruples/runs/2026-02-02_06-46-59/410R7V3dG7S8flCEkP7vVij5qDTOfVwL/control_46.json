I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who kept canceling plans with the author, and after several instances, he told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was asked out initially but declined, then the girl messaged him out of the blue four times to make dinner plans, each time canceling the day of. The author finally confronts her, saying he values his time, and she apologizes, explaining her anxiety. Then, when she suggests another plan, she backs out again, leading the author to tell her off more strongly.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is a human who has a right to feel frustrated if someone is repeatedly canceling, which can be disrespectful. The author tried to be polite and understanding, but after multiple cancellations, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The girl's actions do seem to be a pattern, and the author is justified in expressing his feelings, especially if he's busy and his time is valuable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and is struggling with forming relationships. The author might be dismissive of her genuine issues. However, she initiated the plans each time, so there's a mutual interest. But if she can't follow through, maybe she should have been honest from the start.\n\nThe author's final message was to tell her to not make plans if she can't handle it. That seems a bit harsh, but given the repeated cancellations and her knowing his feelings after the first confrontation, maybe it's reasonable for him to set that boundary. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The author wasn't cruel; he was clear and polite. The girl's actions kept putting the author in a position where his time was wasted. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself after multiple instances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
