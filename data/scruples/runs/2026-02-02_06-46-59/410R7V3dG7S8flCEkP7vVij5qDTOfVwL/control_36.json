I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled their dinner plans four times due to her nervousness. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl initially declined a date but then initiated contact four times, each time making plans and canceling on the day. The author tried to be understanding each time, even after the fourth cancellation. The fifth time, she cancels again but gives another reason about feeling introverted and not wanting to go out. The author then gets fed up and tells her off, saying she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle her anxiety. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The girl kept initiating plans, which might indicate she wanted to move forward, but then canceled, which could be frustrating for the author. He's busy and feels his time is being wasted. After multiple cancellations, he decided to set a boundary. But does that make him in the wrong?\n\nWell, the girl has anxiety and relationship issues, which are valid. The author shows understanding when she apologizes. But when she cancels again, he's upset. It's important to consider that while people have right to cancel for valid reasons, repeated no-shows without a clear pattern of reliability can strain a relationship. The author's time is valuable, and it's reasonable to feel frustrated if someone can't commit to plans they keep initiating. \n\nHowever, the way he communicated his frustration matters. He says he was \"pretty fed up\" and told her off, possibly in a harsh manner. The user mentions he was polite in his initial response after the fourth cancellation, but this time he might have been more direct. It's possible that his reaction, while justified in feeling upset, might not have considered her feelings. But the context shows he did express understanding before, and this is the fifth time. \n\nThe girl's actions are inconsiderate, but her reasons are personal struggles. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially if it's affecting his own well-being. It's a balance between being empathetic and respecting his own time. The community often values communication and setting boundaries when someone is consistently unreliable. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. He tried to be understanding multiple times, but after repeated cancellations, it's reasonable to express his feelings and set limits. The answer would be B (No).\n"
