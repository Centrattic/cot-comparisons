I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The author had someone who kept initiating plans, then canceling last minute four times. After the fourth time, the author sent a polite message about valuing their time. The person apologized and mentioned anxiety. Then the fifth time, the person changed plans again. The author then confronted them, saying they felt insulted and that the person shouldn't make plans if they have anxiety issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and might be struggling with forming relationships. Her cancellations could be due to her mental health, which is a valid issue. The author is a busy person and their time is valuable. Repeated cancellations without notice can be frustrating and disrespectful, even if the reason is anxiety.\n\nThe author tried to be understanding, even after multiple incidents. They communicated their feelings politely after the fourth cancellation. When the fifth happened, they expressed their frustration. It's important to note that the author didn't lash out but rather set boundaries. The girl, on the other hand, kept initiating plans despite knowing her pattern, which might be manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nAnxiety is a real problem, but it shouldn't be used as a reason to repeatedly inconvenience others. The author has the right to set boundaries and not be treated as a doormat. The key point is whether the author's response was appropriate. They didn't confront her harshly but explained their feelings after multiple instances. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their time. The girl's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
