I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that this girl keeps asking him out, then cancels each time. He's polite the first few times, but after four cancellations, he gets fed up and confronts her. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she mentions. She apologizes and explains her problems. He says he understands but is still upset because his time is being wasted. He's a busy person, so repeated cancellations without clear communication could be frustrating. \n\nOn the other hand, she's the one initiating contact each time. If she's struggling with anxiety, maybe she's trying to reach out but is overwhelmed by following through. It's possible she's not intentionally trying to waste his time but is dealing with her own mental health issues. \n\nBut then again, repeatedly making plans and canceling last-minute without a valid reason can be disrespectful. Even if it's due to anxiety, the author's time is valuable. He did give her chances to follow through, and after multiple instances, it's reasonable to set boundaries. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her off, which might come off as harsh, but he did mention he was polite in his initial responses. His final message was direct, but given the circumstances, maybe he had the right to express his frustration. It's about mutual respect here. She should not make plans if she can't commit, and he has the right to feel disrespected if he's being treated that way repeatedly. \n\nSo, considering she initiated the plans each time and he gave her multiple chances, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he had been more supportive and tried to accommodate her anxiety more, that could be a different angle. But since she's the one canceling each time and he's setting boundaries after repeated issues, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key point is whether his reaction was proportionate. He was polite, gave her chances, then finally stood up for himself. It's a matter of personal boundaries. He's not obligated to keep accepting cancellations indefinitely. So, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's setting necessary boundaries after multiple instances of being stood up.\n"
