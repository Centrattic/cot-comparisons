  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling off a girl who canceled plans because she was too nervous?\nPlease read before you rip me apart.\n\nI met this girl who seemed nice enough. I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for confronting a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to her anxiety. \n\nFirst, the girl asked to go on dates four times, each time canceling the day of. The author was polite initially, but after four times, he confronted her, explaining that he values his time. She apologized, mentioned her anxiety, and he was understanding. Then, she tried to make another plan, canceled again, and he got fed up, told her off.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girl initiated contact multiple times, leading the author to believe she was interested. Each time she canceled, which can be frustrating for the author. He's a busy person, so his time is valuable. He tried being understanding but eventually set a boundary. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, people have the right to set boundaries. If someone keeps making plans only to cancel, it's reasonable to feel annoyed. The author tried to accommodate her twice more after she apologized, but she still canceled. So, his frustration is justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety, which the author acknowledged. But if she's not able to follow through, maybe she shouldn't have agreed to the plans. The author isn't attacking her for her anxiety but for the repeated cancellations. His response was direct but not cruel. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself. He gave her chances, and after multiple cancellations, it's reasonable to stop. The answer should be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
