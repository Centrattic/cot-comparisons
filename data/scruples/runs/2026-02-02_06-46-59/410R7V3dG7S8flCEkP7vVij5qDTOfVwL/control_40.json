I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. The author set up a situation where he had four instances where she asked to meet up, then canceled the day of. He finally snapped and told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships. That's valid. People with anxiety might struggle with commitments and may not mean to hurt others. She did apologize and explain her situation after the fourth cancellation. But then she asked again, and when he agreed, she canceled again. \n\nThe author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. He tried to be understanding initially but eventually had enough. The key here is communication and mutual respect. When someone repeatedly cancels without a clear pattern or warning, it's reasonable for the other person to feel frustrated. The author's time is valuable, and he's not obligated to keep accommodating someone who can't commit. \n\nThe question is whether his reaction was justified. He was polite the first time he addressed it, but after another cancellation, he told her off. Was that too harsh? Well, considering she kept initiating plans despite her anxiety, she should be aware that her actions might be affecting him. The author had given her chances and even adjusted plans once (like switching from her coming to his house to going out). His frustration seems valid because she's showing no consistency. \n\nOn the other side, maybe the author could have been more patient, but it's also important to set boundaries. People can't be expected to tolerate disrespectful behavior, even if it's unintentional. The girl's anxiety is a factor, but she's still responsible for her actions. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself and his time. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). He had a right to feel upset and set boundaries after multiple cancellations. It's important to balance understanding with self-respect.\n"
