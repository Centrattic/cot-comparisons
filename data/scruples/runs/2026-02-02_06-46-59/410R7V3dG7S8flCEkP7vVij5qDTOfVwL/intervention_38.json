I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The main issue is the girl canceling plans multiple times, and the author responding by telling her off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The author asked her out initially, and she declined. Then, over four to five months, she randomly messaged him to make plans four times, each time canceling the day of. The first time he was polite, and after the fourth, he told her he values his time. She apologized, mentioned her anxiety. The author accepted but then this last situation happened where she wanted to come to his house, he offered to meet out, but she still canceled. The author then told her he's insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety, which is a valid reason for canceling. But she initiated the plans each time and canceled last minute, which could be frustrating. The author tried to be polite, gave her chances, and after the fourth time, he set a boundary. However, his final reaction was to tell her off, which might come off as harsh, especially if her anxiety is a legitimate issue. \n\nIs the author justified in feeling upset? If someone is repeatedly making plans they can't keep, even after being given feedback, maybe it's reasonable to stop. But was his response appropriate? He didn't try to communicate further or adjust again. The last time, he offered an alternative, but she still canceled. His final message was about being insulted, which could imply taking it personally, which he acknowledges. \n\nThe key points: Did he go too far in his reaction, or was he within his rights to set a boundary? If he's busy and his time is valuable, he's allowed to express that. However, if her anxiety is a real problem and he had compassion before, maybe he should have considered it more. But since she kept initiating despite previous issues, maybe he's not wrong to be fed up. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he tried to be understanding and set a boundary after multiple cancellations. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, but her anxiety is a real issue. The author's frustration is valid, and he's allowed to prioritize his time. However, his tone in the final message (\"pretty much told her that I was insulted\") might be harsh. But the question is about being in the wrong. If he's just setting a boundary, then B (not wrong). If he's overreacting, maybe A. But given that he had four chances and she still didn't follow through, even after adjusting, he's probably not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
