I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that this girl kept asking him to go out, then canceling each time. The author got fed up and told her off. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the events. The girl initiated contact four times, each time making plans which she then canceled on the day. The author was polite initially, but after the fourth time, he expressed his frustration. The girl apologized, mentioned her anxiety and relationship issues. Then she asked again to come over, and he said no problem. When she canceled again, he told her off, saying he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships. It's understandable that she might have trouble committing to plans. But from the author's perspective, being stood up multiple times could be frustrating, especially if he's a busy person. He's trying to manage his time and has a right to feel upset when his time is repeatedly wasted. However, the author did give her the benefit of the doubt each time, even after the first cancellations. The girl did apologize and explain her situation, which he acknowledged.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author tried to be understanding but eventually set a boundary when he felt his time was being disrespected. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, but her reasons were related to her anxiety. The author's response was to confront her, which is a valid way to set boundaries. However, the question is whether he was in the wrong for doing so.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a right to be upset about repeated cancellations. On the other hand, the girl's anxiety might have been a legitimate issue. The author's message was clear: he felt insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't commit. That's a reasonable boundary if someone is repeatedly canceling. But was it fair for him to get angry and tell her off, given her explanations?\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He was patient, gave her multiple chances, and only finally set a boundary after several instances. People have the right to expect some level of respect for their time. If someone can't commit to plans, it's reasonable to step back. The author's frustration is valid, and his response was a way to communicate that he couldn't keep accommodating her cancellations. So the answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
