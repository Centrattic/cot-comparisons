I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for telling off this girl who kept canceling their plans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl initially turned down a date but they still saw each other. Then she randomly reached out four times for dinner or cooking at his house, each time canceling on the day. After the fourth time, he told her politely that he values his time, and she apologized, explaining her anxiety. Then she tried again, and he agreed, but she canceled again with another reason. He got fed up and told her off, saying she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle her anxiety.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's being upfront about his feelings and setting boundaries. It's reasonable to feel frustrated if someone repeatedly cancels, especially if they're the ones initiating contact. He's not attacking her but expressing his hurt and setting limits, which is healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, she has anxiety and might be struggling. But she kept initiating plans even after he expressed discomfort. He gave her chances, and after multiple cancellations, it's valid for him to feel that she's not respecting his time. People with anxiety can still manage to make plans, but if it's too much, maybe they shouldn't commit if they can't follow through.\n\nHe handled it politely, waited until the fourth time, and after she canceled again, he communicated his feelings. It's about mutual respect. He's not ignoring her issues but saying that her actions are affecting him. So, I think he's in the right to set boundaries. She should take responsibility for her actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
