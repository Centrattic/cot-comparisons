I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting a girl who kept canceling their plans. The author tried to be polite but eventually got fed up and told her off. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The girl initiated contact multiple times, which shows she's interested, but then canceled each time. The author is a busy person and felt their time was being wasted. After four cancellations, the author set a boundary, which is understandable. People have different communication styles, but repeatedly canceling without a valid reason can be frustrating.\n\nThe author's response was to express their feelings after the fourth time. They were polite initially, then became more direct when the pattern continued. It's important to note that the author tried to be understanding, acknowledging her anxiety, but eventually had limits. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might have genuine anxiety issues, but initiating plans and then canceling could indicate she's not ready for commitment. The author has the right to set boundaries and not tolerate repeated disrespect for their time. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They gave her multiple chances and communicated their feelings clearly without being abusive. The key is whether the author's response was proportional. Since they tried understanding first and then asserted their needs when it didn't stop, it's reasonable. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't at fault here.\n"
