I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about someone who kept getting canceled by a girl multiple times, and then finally told them off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author asked the girl out initially, but she declined. Then, over the next few months, she messaged him out of the blue four times to make plans, each time canceling on the day. The author tried to be polite the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, he sent a polite message about valuing his time. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then, another cancellation happened, and the author got fed up and told her off.\n\nSo, the key points here are repeated cancellations, the author's reaction, and the reasons provided by the girl. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. That's a valid reason for her cancellations. She might be struggling and reached out to someone she felt comfortable with, hence initiating contact multiple times. Her apologies and explanations suggest she's aware of the problem and is trying, albeit imperfectly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a busy person and has a right to value his time. Being canceled multiple times without much notice can be frustrating. The author was polite initially but eventually set boundaries after the fourth time. The final incident, where she still canceled and then the author expressed his frustration, seems like a reasonable response after repeated instances.\n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction was justified. The author tried to be understanding and even adjusted plans (like suggesting going out instead of her coming over). When someone repeatedly cancels despite knowing the other person's time is valuable, setting boundaries is understandable. The author's final message, while maybe a bit harsh, was after several attempts to be accommodating. It's about mutual respect for each other's time and emotional energy.\n\nThe girl might need support, but the author isn't obligated to be her therapist or caretaker. It's a balance between empathy and self-respect. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and deciding to stop engaging if the girl can't commit to plans. He addressed it politely and gave her chances, so his reaction seems justified.\n"
