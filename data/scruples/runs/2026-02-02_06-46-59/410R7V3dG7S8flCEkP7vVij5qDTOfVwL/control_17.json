I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans four times because she was nervous. \n\nFirst, the girl initiated contact multiple times, which shows some interest. The author was polite when she canceled initially, giving her the benefit of the doubt. Then, after four cancellations, he set a boundary by expressing his feelings. That makes sense because it's reasonable to value one's time.\n\nThe key points are: she canceled multiple times, he was understanding at first, and then finally stood up for himself. The user might think that being understanding is always the right approach, but there's a limit. The author wasn't abusive or confrontational; he was firm but polite. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, so his response isn't unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the last time, she even changed her mind again about the plans, which probably added to his frustration. It's about mutual respect here. If someone keeps making plans and then canceling, it's fair to address it. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. He's not expecting her to fix her anxiety, just to be respectful of his time. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
