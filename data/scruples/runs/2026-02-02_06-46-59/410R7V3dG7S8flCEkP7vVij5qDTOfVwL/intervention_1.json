I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times because she was too nervous. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl initially said no to a date but kept meeting at events. Then, four months later, she started messaging to make plans, but canceled each time on the day. The author was polite the first time, but after four cancellations, he got fed up and told her off, explaining he's busy and doesn't want his time wasted. Now, she asked again to make dinner at his house, canceled, and he got upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the girl has anxiety and struggles with forming relationships. She might be trying to reach out and build a connection, but her anxiety is causing her to back out. The author might be right to feel his time is being wasted, especially if this is repetitive. But on the other hand, he did give her multiple chances, was polite, and tried to understand her situation. He even offered alternatives when she canceled. \n\nHowever, when he told her off, was that justified? If she's making the first move each time, maybe she's trying to build trust. But after four times, it's reasonable to feel frustrated. The key point is whether the author overreacted. He didn't lash out, just communicated his feelings politely. The girl's anxiety is a valid issue, but repeatedly canceling plans can be hurtful. \n\nThe author's main issue is about respect for his time. People have boundaries, and it's okay to set them. The girl might need to realize that if she can't commit to plans, it's not fair to the other person. However, the author could have been more empathetic, but given the repetition, his frustration is understandable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's response was appropriate. Since he communicated his feelings calmly and set a boundary, he's not entirely in the wrong. The girl might need to take responsibility for her actions. So, the answer would be B (no, he's not in the wrong).\n"
