I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times because of her nervousness. The author set up a scenario where he met a girl, she initially declined a date but they saw each other at events. Then, over four months, she messaged him four times to plan dinners or other outings, each time canceling the day of. He responded politely the first few times, then after the fourth cancellation, he told her he valued his time. She apologized, mentioning her anxiety. Then, she tried to set up another dinner at his house, canceled again, and he got fed up and confronted her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to figure out if the author's actions were reasonable or not.\n\nFirst, the girl's actions. She canceled multiple times, each time on the day of. That's pretty consistent behavior. She had anxiety and issues with forming relationships, which she mentioned. But she kept initiating plans, which shows she might not fully grasp her own limitations or the impact on others. She's using a busy person's time repeatedly and then backing out.\n\nThe author's actions: He tried to be polite multiple times, gave her space, and even tried to accommodate her by suggesting alternatives when she canceled. After the fourth time, he set a boundary, which is understandable. When she canceled again, he expressed his frustration, which seems like a reasonable response after repeated issues.\n\nNow, the key points. Is it wrong for the author to feel upset? Probably not. People can have boundaries and expect respect for their time. The girl's behavior was inconsiderate, not just her anxiety. She kept making plans she wasn't sure about. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary after so many cancellations. He did try to be understanding, but his patience ran out. It's reasonable to expect that if someone can't commit to plans, they shouldn't keep making them.\n\nBut wait, the user said they think the author is in the wrong. Maybe they feel the author should have been more patient or tried to help her work through her anxiety. However, the author isn't responsible for fixing her issues. He's under no obligation to continue investing time in someone who repeatedly cancels. The girl's responsibility is to manage her anxiety in a way that doesn't affect others unnecessarily.\n\nSo, the author's actions were justified. He communicated clearly, tried to be flexible, and finally set a boundary. The girl's behavior was the main issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself.\n"
