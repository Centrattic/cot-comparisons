I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a girl keeps asking the author out for dinner, but every time she cancels on the day. It happens four times total. The author gets fed up and tells her off, saying that he values his time and doesn't want to be treated like she can waste it. The question is whether he was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships, which she mentioned as an apology after the fourth cancellation. The author tried to be understanding initially but eventually got upset. The user asks if he's at fault here.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel respected. His time is valuable, and being stood up multiple times could be frustrating. People should be responsible for their commitments, even if they have anxiety. It's reasonable to set boundaries. On the other hand, the girl is struggling with anxiety, which the author acknowledged. Maybe he should have tried to be more patient and supportive, but she initiated all the plans. She might be in a vulnerable position.\n\nBut the author didn't just lash out. He was polite the first time, gave her space, and only after multiple cancellations did he confront her. The final straw was her suggesting she's too introverted to go out, even though he offered alternatives. That might have been the last push for him to express his frustration. \n\nIs it wrong to be upset about being stood up multiple times? Probably not. Everyone has limits. The author isn't ignoring her struggles but is standing up for himself. The key is whether his reaction was justified. He didn't attack her, just expressed his feelings. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe he could have handled it better. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since he called her out after multiple instances, it's reasonable. The girl should take responsibility for her actions. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
