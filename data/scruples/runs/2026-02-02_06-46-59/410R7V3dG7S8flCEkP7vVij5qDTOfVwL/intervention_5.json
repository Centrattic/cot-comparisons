I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. The author explained that the girl contacted them multiple times, each time making plans that she then canceled on the day. After four times, he told her off about valuing his time and finally lost it when she canceled again by saying she didn't feel like going out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which is valid. She might be struggling with mental health, and initiating contact despite her anxiety shows some effort. However, the author is a busy person and is being treated like a doormat. Repeated cancellations without proper notice can be frustrating and disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author did give her space after the fourth cancellation and allowed her to apologize. But when she approached again, he felt wronged. Is it wrong to set boundaries? The author isn't being cruel; he's standing up for his own time and feelings. People have the right to be respected in their time and to not be manipulated, even if the person has issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl's anxiety might be genuine, and maybe she's not fully aware of the impact her actions are having. But after multiple instances, it's reasonable for the author to feel upset. The author's response was to be polite initially, then to set a boundary when pushed further. It's about mutual respect. If someone keeps using your time without regard for your schedule, it's fair to address it.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his own needs and boundaries, which is necessary after repeated disrespect to his time. It's important to balance understanding with self-respect.\n"
