I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girl canceled four times after initiating plans, and the author finally told her off. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, from the author's perspective, they were trying to be polite and understanding. They even said \"no problem\" when she canceled the first few times. But after the fourth time, they sent a polite message about valuing their time. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety and issues with relationships. The author was okay with that. But then, when she proposed another plan and canceled again, the author got fed up and told her off.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety, which is a valid reason for not being able to commit. People with anxiety might struggle to form relationships because of fear or discomfort. However, the author is also a person who has a busy life and might find it frustrating to have plans canceled repeatedly. They have the right to set boundaries and not let others waste their time. \n\nThe author didn't lash out immediately; they waited until the fourth cancellation and tried to be understanding. When the girl canceled again, the author expressed their feelings. The key here is whether the author overstepped. They didn't attack the girl's character but stated their feelings about being treated disrespectfully. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl kept initiating plans, which implies she wanted to build a connection. If she's truly anxious, maybe she should communicate that better or not make plans if she can't follow through. But she might be struggling with her mental health, and the author might be expected to be more patient.\n\nHowever, the author has the right to not be treated like a doormat. It's reasonable to ask for consistency in commitments, especially when someone keeps reaching out. The author's frustration is valid because they're respecting their own time and setting boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They weren't cruel; they expressed their feelings after multiple instances. They tried to be understanding initially. It seems like they acted within their rights to protect their time. The girl might need to take responsibility for her actions as well. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
