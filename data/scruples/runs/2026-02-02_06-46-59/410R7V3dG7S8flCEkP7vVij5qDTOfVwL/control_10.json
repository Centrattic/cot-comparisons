I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times because of her nervousness.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was asked out by a girl who initially declined but then kept initiating plans. Each time, she canceled on the day, four times in total. The author was polite the first time, and after the fourth, got fed up and confronted her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girl has anxiety and relationship issues, which caused her to cancel. The author felt their time was being wasted and finally told her off. \n\nOn one hand, the girl has valid reasons for her anxiety. It's important to be understanding, especially if she's struggling. However, the author also has the right to value their time. Repeated cancellations can be frustrating, even if the reasons are valid. \n\nThe author did give her space and was polite initially. After multiple instances, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The final incident where she wanted to come over but changed her mind again might have been the last straw. The author's reaction was to express their hurt and frustration, which is a personal boundary. \n\nSo, is it wrong? Well, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, the way they expressed it might be harsh. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the tone. Since the girl's actions were consistent and the author tried to be understanding, it's a mutual issue. \n\nThe answer would be B (No), because the author had the right to feel upset and set boundaries after repeated cancellations, even if empathetic consideration is needed.\n"
