I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a girl keeps asking him out, but cancels each time on the day of the planned meeting. This happens four times. He finally tells her off, saying he values his time and doesn't want her to waste it. She apologizes, mentions her anxiety and relationship issues. He says it's okay. Then, she asks again, and when he suggests alternatives, she still cancels again. He gets fed up and tells her off again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From his perspective, he's a busy person. Repeated cancellations would be frustrating. Even if he's polite initially, after four times, it's understandable he's upset. He's setting boundaries by telling her off politely after the fourth cancellation. Then, when she tries again and cancels once more, he's justified in feeling insulted because she's initiating contact but then backing out each time. He's not forcing her to do anything; she's the one making plans. So, he's not the one being inconsiderate. \n\nOn her side, she has anxiety and issues forming relationships. That's a valid reason for her behavior. She's reaching out, which shows she might want to connect, but her anxiety is getting in the way. However, she's still making plans she can't keep, which is inconsiderate to him. Even if she has reasons, she should be aware that her actions are affecting someone else. \n\nHe tried to be understanding, but after multiple cancellations, it's reasonable for him to set boundaries. He didn't push her for explanations initially, just said it's no problem. Then, after she apologized, he was okay with it. But when she tried again and canceled again, he had the right to express his frustration. He's not the one who's inconsiderate here. She's the one making plans she can't keep, which is disrespectful to his time. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself after multiple instances of being stood up. He's been patient and understanding, but after four times, it's reasonable to expect that if someone is going to cancel repeatedly, they should not make plans in the first place. His frustration is justified.\n"
