I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to nervousness or anxiety. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl who initially wasn't interested in a date but they saw each other at events. Then, after a few months, she randomly asked him out four times, each time canceling on the day. The first four times, he was polite and said it's okay. After the fourth cancellation, he sent a polite message about valuing his time. She apologized, explained her anxiety and issues with relationships. He said it's no problem. Then she asked again, and he agreed. She ended up canceling again, saying she wasn't comfortable coming to his house. He then told her he was insulted and that if she has anxiety, she shouldn't make plans with him. Now he's asking if he was wrong to feel that way or if he should be more understanding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she initiated contact multiple times, each time she canceled, which might have been frustrating. He tried to be understanding initially but eventually snapped. The main question is about boundaries and whether he overstepped.\n\nFrom his perspective, he's a busy person, and having plans canceled multiple times can be frustrating. He tried to be polite and understanding, but after repeated cancellations, his frustration boiled over. It's important to consider if he was within his rights to express his feelings, especially after she continued to cancel despite his previous feedback.\n\nOn the other hand, she has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which can affect her ability to follow through. She did apologize and explain her situation. The fact that she kept initiating plans might indicate she's trying to build a connection despite her issues. His response was to tell her she shouldn't make plans if she has anxiety, which could be seen as dismissive of her struggles.\n\nHowever, setting boundaries is important. If someone repeatedly cancels, it's reasonable to express that it's affecting you. The problem might be that he gave her multiple chances, but eventually, he had the right to set a boundary. The way he expressed his frustration might have been harsh, but his feelings are valid. It's a balance between understanding her anxiety and respecting his own time and feelings.\n\nThe key is whether he was in the wrong for expressing his frustration. Since he tried to be understanding and only snapped after multiple cancellations, it's a bit of a gray area. However, he did confront her politely initially and she continued the behavior. His final response might have been a bit harsh, but he's not entirely wrong to feel upset. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had the right to set boundaries, even if the delivery could have been better. But maybe there's a different take.\n"
