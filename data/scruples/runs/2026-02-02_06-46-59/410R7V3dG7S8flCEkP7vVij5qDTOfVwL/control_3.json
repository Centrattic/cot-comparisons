I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times because she was nervous. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was asked out by a girl, then she canceled four times. Each time, he was polite, but after the fourth time, he told her he values his time and doesn't appreciate her wasting it. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then she tried again, and he agreed, but she canceled again. This time, he got fed up and told her off.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to feel upset and confront her. The girl has anxiety, which is a valid issue, but she kept initiating plans and canceling. The author is a busy person and felt his time was being disrespected.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to feel disrespected if someone repeatedly makes plans and cancels. It's reasonable to set boundaries. On the other hand, the girl has anxiety, so maybe she's struggling. But she kept reaching out, which might mean she's seeking connection but can't follow through.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her off, which might have been harsh, but he tried to be polite before. After multiple cancellations, it's understandable to feel frustrated. The key is whether his reaction was in the wrong. Since he communicated his feelings and set a boundary, it's more about mutual respect. He's not in the wrong for standing up for himself, especially after repeated instances. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
