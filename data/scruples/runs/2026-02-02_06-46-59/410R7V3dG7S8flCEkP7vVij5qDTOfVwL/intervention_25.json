I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to anxiety. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girl approached the author four times, each time making plans and then canceling the same day. The author was polite the first time, but after four cancellations, they expressed frustration, saying they value their time. The last time, the girl didn't even show up again, leading the author to confront her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl initiated all the contact, canceled each time, and didn't follow through. The author felt their time was being wasted. The author then confronted her, expressing that they were insulted by her behavior. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The girl has anxiety, which might explain her cancellations. The author is within their right to set boundaries and express their feelings if someone is repeatedly not respecting their time. However, the author did call her out in a confrontational way after she apologized before, which might not be the best approach. But the girl kept initiating plans, knowing she might cancel, which is perhaps inconsiderate. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. People should be able to set boundaries. But maybe there's a better way to handle it without confrontation. However, the author did try to be polite first. The girl's actions were inconsistent, and the author had legitimate feelings about their time being disregarded. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They had a right to feel upset and set limits. The girl's anxiety is a factor, but she kept making plans knowing she might cancel. The author's response, while direct, was a reasonable boundary after multiple instances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
