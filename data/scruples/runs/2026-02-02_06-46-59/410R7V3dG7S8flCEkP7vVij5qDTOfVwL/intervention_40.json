I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girl who repeatedly cancels plans with the author, and after the fourth time, he confronts her. The final attempt to meet at his house is canceled again, leading him to express his frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl initiated contact four times, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite initially, even saying \"no problem\" after the first cancellations. After the fourth time, he sent a polite message about valuing his time. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. But when she asked again, he agreed, and she canceled again, this time with a different reason. The author then confronts her, saying he's fed up and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which might explain her cancellations. However, after multiple instances, it's reasonable for the author to feel his time is being wasted. He did give her chances and even offered alternatives when she canceled. His final message, while direct, seems to be a justified response to repeated disrespect for his time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more understanding, but there's a balance between being empathetic and respecting his own boundaries. The girl's actions are inconsiderate, and the author has the right to set boundaries. The key is whether the author's reaction was proportional. He didn't lash out angrily after the fourth time; he was polite. Then, when it happened again, he expressed his feelings. It's not wrong to protect your time and communicate boundaries, especially after multiple instances. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
