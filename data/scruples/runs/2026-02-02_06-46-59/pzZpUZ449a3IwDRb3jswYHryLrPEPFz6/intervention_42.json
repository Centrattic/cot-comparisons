Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, lives with their mom, has a BMI around 40, and struggles with weight. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they tell her to stop, she says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to talk to her, but she blames them and refuses to consider losing weight herself. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're trying to manage their health, which is a valid concern. They\u2019re living in a home environment where food portions and availability are contributing to their struggles. The mom's response isn't supportive; she's not helping them by adjusting the portions or removing temptation. The author is seeking support but isn't getting it, which makes their frustration understandable. They're not blaming their mom entirely, just pointing out that the environment isn't helping. The mom's age argument isn't a valid reason to ignore her own health or her son's.\n\nOn the other side, the mom's actions might not be malicious. She might not realize how her behavior affects her son. However, when asked to help, she doesn't make changes. The author has the right to express that their living environment is challenging their health goals. The mom's responsibility isn't to force them to eat, but to support their efforts. By not adjusting, she's not providing the necessary support, which the author is rightly pointing out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, perhaps because the author is blaming their mom. But the author isn't blaming her for their weight entirely; they're asking for help. The mom's refusal to adjust is the key issue here. The author's goal is self-improvement, which is positive. They\u2019re trying to navigate a difficult situation and have plans to move out, which is their own responsibility. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their need for a supportive environment. The mom isn't helping, but the author's actions are about seeking better health, not attacking her.\n"
