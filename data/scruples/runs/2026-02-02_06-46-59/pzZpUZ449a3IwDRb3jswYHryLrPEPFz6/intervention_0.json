Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their mom. The author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom who is also obese. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they ask her to stop, she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom is overfeeding them and is partly responsible for their weight. They tried to talk to her but she blames them. The author is considering moving out to lose weight.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is taking responsibility for their own health by trying to address the issue. They've communicated their concerns to their mom, who doesn't seem to take them seriously. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive, not helpful. The author is struggling with self-control, which is a common issue in obesity. The mom's behavior (huge portions, buying snacks) could contribute to the problem, especially if she's not supportive.\n\nIs the author at fault for wanting help? Probably not. They're trying to make changes but need support. The mom isn't providing that, which is a problem. The author isn't forcing the mom to buy or cook the food; they're seeking assistance. The mom's lack of support might be the bigger issue here. The author is taking steps on their own (exercise, moving out plan) which shows they're proactive.\n\nBut maybe some might argue the author should take full responsibility for their own choices, regardless of the mom's actions. However, given the mom's role in creating the environment (portions, availability of unhealthy food), it's reasonable for the author to ask for a healthier home environment. The author isn't wrong for needing support and making that clear.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The author is seeking help and is aware of their issue, which is a positive step. The mom's lack of support is the main problem here.\n"
