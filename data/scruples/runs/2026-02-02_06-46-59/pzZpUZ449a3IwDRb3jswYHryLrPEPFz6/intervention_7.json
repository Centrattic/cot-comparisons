Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Alright, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, living with their mom who also has weight issues. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they ask her to stop, she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that their mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to get her to help with losing weight, but she blames them instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult living with their mom, so maybe the mom's role in their eating habits is a point of contention. The author is trying to take responsibility by cutting down on food, but the mom's actions are making it hard. The mom's response seems dismissive, not supportive. The author's frustration is about needing help from the mom, who isn't cooperating.\n\nBut wait, is the author in the wrong? Well, they are trying to address a health issue, which is important. However, blaming the mom for their weight might not be entirely fair. The mom's actions (portions, buying chocolate) are contributing factors, but the author has control over their own choices. The mom's advice is, while not helpful, is technically true\u2014no one is making them eat it. The author has the autonomy to choose not to eat, even if it's difficult. However, the mom's lack of support is a problem, but does that make the author in the wrong? Or is it the mom's responsibility to create a supportive environment?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is commendable. The mom's response is not helpful, but the author's frustration is valid in that they need support. The author isn't necessarily wrong for asking for help. However, the author might be overstepping by placing blame on the mother when they have the capacity to make their own choices. The line between needing support and taking personal responsibility is a bit blurry here.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They're seeking to improve their health and are trying to communicate their needs. The mom's lack of support is an issue, but the author is not to blame for their situation. They are taking steps to address their weight, which is a good sign. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
