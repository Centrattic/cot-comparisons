Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mother. The mom is also obese. The author feels that the mother is overfeeding them with large portions and buying unhealthy snacks, making it hard for them to control their eating. The author has tried to communicate this calmly but the mother responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" and dismisses the author's concerns. The author is struggling with self-control and wants help from their mom, but the mom isn't supportive. The author is considering moving out to tackle the issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is trying to address a health issue related to their weight, which is a legitimate concern. They are not blaming their mother directly but pointing out that the environment (large portions and unhealthy snacks) contributes to their problem. The mother isn't helping, which makes it harder for the author to lose weight. The author is seeking support, not necessarily demanding the mother to change, just asking for cooperation.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting a healthier environment? Probably not. They're taking responsibility by saying they need to work on their self-control but also acknowledge external factors. The mother's response seems dismissive. The author isn't attacking the mom's habits in a hostile way; they tried to approach it kindly. The mother's age being mentioned as a reason not to lose weight doesn't address the author's needs. The author is in a tough spot, trying to manage their health in a supportive environment but isn't getting that support. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
