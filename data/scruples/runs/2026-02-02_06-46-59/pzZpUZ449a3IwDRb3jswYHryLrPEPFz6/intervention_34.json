Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They want to lose weight and are trying to control their diet. They tell their mom that she's overfeeding them with big portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which they can't resist. The mom's response is \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mom is partially responsible for their weight and tried to talk to her, but she blames them and says they just need to not eat. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nHmm. The mom is cooking large portions and buying a lot of chocolate. The author can't control themselves and eats it, leading to their obesity. The mom's response is to tell them not to eat it, but she's not helping. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight but feels the mom isn't supportive.\n\nFirst, I should consider if the author has a valid point. The mom's actions (big portions, buying chocolate) might be contributing to the author's difficulty in managing their diet. The author is trying to communicate their needs, but the mom isn't providing support. However, the mom might argue that she's not forcing them to eat, so maybe she's not directly responsible.\n\nBut the author is an adult (18 years old), and they live with their mom. The mom's cooking is part of their environment, and if the author can't control their eating in that environment, maybe the mom's habits are making it harder. However, the author also needs to take responsibility for their own choices. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive, but the author is in control of whether they eat or not. The mom isn't forcing them, so maybe the author is projecting their lack of self-control onto the mom.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is struggling with self-control and is trying to address it. They're not blaming the mom entirely but feel she could help. The mom's refusal to take responsibility might be part of the problem. But is the author wrong for thinking the mom is overfeeding them? Or is it the author's own responsibility to manage their eating habits despite the environment?\n\nI think the author's situation is complicated. They are trying to take steps to improve their health, which is positive. The mom's lack of support is a challenge, but the author is still an adult and needs to take responsibility for their own choices. However, the mom's actions are contributing to the environment that makes it hard for the author. The author isn't wrong for recognizing that their environment is a challenge, but they might be overstepping by blaming the mom for their lack of self-control. The mom's response is to tell them not to eat, which is a matter of personal responsibility.\n\nSo maybe the author is not in the wrong for recognizing the problem, but they should focus on their own actions rather than blaming the mom. Alternatively, the author is in the wrong for not taking full responsibility for their eating habits regardless of the mom's actions. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key point is whether the author is holding the mom accountable in a way that's fair. Since the mom isn't forcing the author to eat, the author's responsibility is more on their own actions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in expecting the mom to change her habits just because the author can't control themselves."
