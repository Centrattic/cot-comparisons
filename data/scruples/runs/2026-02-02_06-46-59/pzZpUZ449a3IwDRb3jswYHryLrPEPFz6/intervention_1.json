Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom, and has a BMI around 40. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, but when they ask her to stop, she says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to talk to her, but she blames them and refuses to help.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions: they want to lose weight and are trying to address the environment that's contributing to their overeating. It's reasonable to think that the home environment, including portion sizes and availability of unhealthy food, can impact eating habits. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" dismisses the author's struggle with self-control, which might be part of their eating disorder or lack of willpower. However, the author is trying to take responsibility by saying they want to do it themselves once they move out. \n\nThe mom's behavior\u2014making large portions and buying lots of chocolate\u2014could be contributing to the problem, even if unintentionally. The author is not blaming the mom entirely but asking for her help. The mom's refusal to acknowledge her role and her dismissive attitude might be part of the issue. \n\nIs the author wrong for expressing their feelings? They are seeking help and trying to address the situation. It's their right to communicate their needs. The mom's response is unhelpful, but the author isn't in the wrong for trying to set boundaries or ask for support. The key here is whether the author is taking responsibility for their own actions. They are, by saying they'll work on it themselves once they move out. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting their mom to adjust her behavior to support their health goals. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
