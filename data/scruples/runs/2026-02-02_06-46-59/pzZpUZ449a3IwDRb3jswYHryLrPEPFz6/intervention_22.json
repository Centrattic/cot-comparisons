Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is 18 and living with their mom, who is also obese. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, making it hard for them to control their eating. They tried talking to their mom about it, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and doesn't support their efforts to lose weight. The author is questioning if they're at fault for thinking their mom is overfeeding them and for trying to address it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18) but still living with their mom. They want to lose weight and feel that their environment isn't helping. The mom's responses seem dismissive and not supportive. The author is trying to take responsibility by saying they have to do it themselves until they move out in 4 years. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're not directly harming anyone else. They're trying to communicate their needs but aren't getting the support. The mom's behavior might not be malicious, but it's contributing to the problem. The author's frustration is understandable. They're trying to take steps to improve their health, which is a personal choice. The mom's lack of support isn't helping, but the author isn't doing anything wrong for wanting to address it. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
