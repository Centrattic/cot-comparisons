Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mother. They feel their mother is overfeeding them by making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate. The author tried to talk to their mom about this, but she keeps saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" which they can't resist. The author is frustrated because their mother isn't helping them with their weight loss efforts and instead blames them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author's actions or thoughts are unjust. The author is expressing concern about their health and seeking support from their mother. They're not saying their mom is doing it on purpose to harm them, just that the environment is making it harder to lose weight. The mother's response is dismissive, not helping. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the mother to cook or buy chocolate; they're asking for support. The mother, however, isn't providing the help the author needs. The author's BMI is around 40, which is a significant health issue. They are trying to take steps themselves but feel their environment isn't conducive. \n\nIs it wrong for the author to feel that their mother's actions contribute to their weight problem? The mother's large portions and availability of unhealthy snacks might indeed make it harder for the author to manage their eating. The author is taking responsibility by trying to move out and make changes, but they're also acknowledging their own struggle with self-control. \n\nThe mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common but unhelpful response when someone is struggling with compulsive eating. The author is in a tough spot, trying to get support from a family member who isn't providing it. They're not blaming their mom entirely but are seeking understanding and help. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't at fault for wanting to take steps to improve their health. The mother's lack of support is her own issue. The author isn't wrong for feeling that their environment is contributing to their problem. So the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking responsibility where they can and seeking help, which is reasonable.\n"
