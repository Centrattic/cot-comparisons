Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is obese with a BMI of around 40, living with their mom, and the mom's cooking habits (big portions, buying a lot of chocolate) are making it hard for them to lose weight. The author has tried to talk to their mom about it, but she dismisses their concerns by saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight and is seeking help, but the mom isn't supporting them. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the author's health concerns, their attempts to communicate with their mom, and the mom's lack of support. The author is clearly trying to take responsibility for their health by addressing the issue and making changes. However, they're in a situation where their living environment makes weight management difficult. \n\nThe mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the author's struggle with self-control. While the mom might not have intended to overfeed, her actions are contributing to the problem. The author isn't blaming the mom out of spite but is seeking support. The mom's age isn't a valid reason to ignore her own health or the impact of her habits on her son/daughter.\n\nThe author is taking steps to improve their own health despite the challenges. They aren't demanding the mom change everything but are asking for help, which is reasonable. The mom's refusal to acknowledge her role or support the author's efforts is the main issue here. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing this out. They're trying to address a health issue and have communicated their needs. The real problem lies with the mom's lack of cooperation and understanding.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
