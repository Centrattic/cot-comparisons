Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author thinking their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and is trying to lose weight. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they tell her to stop, she says \"Well you don't have to eat it.\" The author is frustrated because their mom isn't helping them with their weight issues and even blames them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is taking responsibility by trying to address the issue and asking their mom for help. They've communicated their concerns, but their mom isn't supporting them, instead being dismissive. The mom's response is to just say that the author can choose not to eat, which doesn't seem helpful. \n\nThe author's argument is that they have a hard time controlling themselves, so the environment (big portions, easy access to unhealthy food) is a factor. They're not blaming the mom outright but are pointing out that the mom's actions might be contributing to their weight problem. The mom, on the other hand, is not taking their concerns seriously and is shifting responsibility back to the author.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author is an adult (18), they still live with their mom, so the mom's cooking habits affect them. But the author also has autonomy and could make choices independently. However, the mom is not being supportive when asked. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to address a problem they have. They're not forcing the mom to cook a certain way; they're just asking for help. The mom isn't helping, so the author is trying to take steps on their own. The author's frustration is about not getting support when they need it. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that the author is overreacting or that the mom is just being honest about the situation. However, the mom's response isn't supportive, and the author is seeking help to overcome a health issue. The author isn't to blame for their own weight; they're trying to manage it. The mom's behavior is enabling the problem by not cooperating when asked. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking initiative to improve their health and have communicated their needs, even if the mom isn't responding well. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
