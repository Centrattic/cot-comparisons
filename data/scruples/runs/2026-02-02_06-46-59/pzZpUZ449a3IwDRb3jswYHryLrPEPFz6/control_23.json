Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author living with their mom, who makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author is struggling with obesity and feels that their mom's overfeeding is contributing to it. They've tried talking to their mom, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The mom also blames the author for their weight and dismisses their concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to address their health by reducing food intake but feels their mom isn't helping. The mom's behavior of making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks might be enabling the author's overeating. The author isn't directly causing their overeating; they admit they have a hard time resisting. They've communicated their needs but haven't received support. The mom's responses are dismissive, which isn't helpful for the author's goals. \n\nConsidering that the author is 18 and living with their parent, it's reasonable for them to seek support at home. The mom's actions (overfeeding and not helping) could be part of the problem. The author isn't blaming their mom outright but pointing out her role in their situation. Since the author is trying to take steps to improve their health and has asked for help, they aren't in the wrong. The mom's response is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
