Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong in their situation with their mom. The author is obese, lives with their mom, and feels their mom is overfeeding them by making huge portions and buying lots of chocolate. The mom responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author struggles with self-control and feels the mom isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are the author's health, their living situation, and the mom's behavior. The author is 18, obese, and trying to lose weight. They live with their mom who is also obese. The mom cooks large portions and buys unhealthy snacks, and when the author asks her to help by not buying those or making smaller portions, the mom doesn't support them, instead blaming them for not having self-control. The author feels the mom is part of the problem.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author is trying to address a health issue by talking to their mom about portion sizes and unhealthy foods. They're asking for support, which is reasonable. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive and not helpful, as the author admits they can't control themselves when presented with large portions and temptations. The author is seeking help to manage their weight, which is a personal health goal, and the mom isn't providing the support they need. \n\nIs there any way the author could be at fault? Maybe not taking initiative themselves? But the author mentions they are trying to do things on their own and plan to move out in four years. The problem is the environment they're in. It's common for people to need support from their family when making lifestyle changes. The mom's lack of support could be hindering the author's efforts. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom might have a role in providing a healthy environment, especially since she's the one cooking and buying food. The author is honest about their struggle with self-control, which is a valid issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this. The mom's behavior is more at fault here for not providing the needed support. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
