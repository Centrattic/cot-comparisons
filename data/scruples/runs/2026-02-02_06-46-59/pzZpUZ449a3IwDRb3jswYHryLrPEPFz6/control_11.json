Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author, who is obese, living with their mother. The mother cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. The author tried to talk to their mom about this, suggesting she's partly responsible for their weight, but the mom blames them and says they don't have to eat it. The author is frustrated because they can't control themselves and feel they need help.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is concerned about their health and has a BMI around 40, which is morbidly obese. They're trying to lose weight but find it hard because their mom's food habits aren't helping. The mom's responses are dismissive, telling the author they don't have to eat what's there. The author feels unsupported and is considering moving out to manage their diet better.\n\nNow, considering if the author is at fault. The author is aware of their health issue and is trying to take steps to address it. They've communicated their concerns to their mother, which is a responsible action. The mother's response is not helpful, as she's not offering support and is instead being defensive. The author isn't forcing the mother to cook large portions or buy chocolate; they're reacting to the environment the mother creates. The author's request for help isn't unreasonable, especially given their health situation.\n\nThe mother's responsibility here might be in the way she's enabling the behavior by providing excessive food and not being supportive when the child tries to make healthier choices. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take control of their health and seeking support. They've acknowledged their own struggle with self-control, which shows awareness. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't address the underlying issue of the environment contributing to overeating.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They're taking initiative to improve their health and have communicated their needs. The mother's lack of support is the issue here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
