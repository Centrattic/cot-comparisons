Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author living with their mom, who makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. The author thinks their mom is overfeeding them and that this contributes to their obesity. The mom responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and still living with their mom. They mention they have a BMI around 40, which is in the obese range. They want to lose weight and have tried to discuss this with their mom, but she's not supportive. The mom's responses seem dismissive, not addressing the actual issue of portion sizes and availability of unhealthy food.\n\nThe author feels their mom is partly responsible because she creates an environment that makes it hard for them to control their eating. The mom, on the other hand, is in denial about her own weight and isn't willing to make changes. The author is trying to take steps on their own but feels unsupported.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to address their health concerns. They've communicated their needs to their mom but haven't received support. The mom's responses are avoiding responsibility. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is acknowledging their own struggle with self-control. They're seeking help, which is reasonable. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should take full responsibility for their choices, regardless of the environment. But given that they have a known issue with self-control and the environment is contributing (large portions, easy access to unhealthy food), it's reasonable for the author to ask for support. The mom's refusal to help complicates the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their concerns and trying to take steps to improve their health. They are in a difficult situation where their environment isn't supportive. The mom is not helping, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to make changes and seeking support. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
