Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation.\n\nThe author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that their mom cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has issues with self-control and tells their mom that her overfeeding might be contributing to their weight. The mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which frustrates the author. The author feels blamed by the mom and wants support but isn't getting it. The author is considering moving out to take control of their diet.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address their health issue. Being obese and wanting to lose weight is a personal health goal. They are trying to communicate their needs to their mom, which is reasonable. However, the mom is not a medical professional and her actions might be out of habit or her own comfort with food. The author's mom also has weight issues, so maybe she's not in a position to change her habits easily.\n\nThe author's approach: they are asking the mom to adjust her cooking and purchases to help them control their eating. Is that a fair request? Since they live under the same roof, the author might need to consider their mom's perspective. The mom might not see the issue or might have different views on portion sizes and food. The author is taking responsibility by trying to change, but the mom's response is dismissive.\n\nHowever, the author is still a minor (18) and might rely on their mom for meals. The author's self-control is a personal challenge, but they are trying to communicate that external factors (like portion sizes) make it harder. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be simplistic and not helpful, but the author's approach could be seen as placing responsibility on the mom for their own eating habits. Maybe the author should take more personal responsibility instead of expecting the mom to change.\n\nBut then again, the author is struggling with self-control and is seeking support. The mom's lack of support could be part of the problem. The author's actions are about their health, which is valid. So, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to improve their health and seeking support. However, maybe they could work on self-control more independently, rather than relying on their mom to adjust her habits. It's a complex situation where both parties might have some responsibility.\n\nThe author's mom might be enabling the behavior by providing large portions, but the ultimate choice to eat is the author's. So, the author might be partially at fault for not taking more personal responsibility, but the mom could also adjust her cooking. However, the author is trying to address the issue, so maybe they are in the right. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's accurate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they are trying to take steps to improve their health and communicate their needs. The mom's response is unhelpful, but the author's intention is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
