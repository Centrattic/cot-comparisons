Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity, and the mom not supporting their efforts to lose weight. The author is 18 and still living with their mother. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about their health and weight, which is valid. They're trying to take steps to improve their lifestyle, which is commendable. They've tried communicating their needs to their mom, but the mom's responses are dismissive, like \"you don't have to eat it.\" \n\nThe mom, on the other hand, might not be intentionally causing harm. She might not realize the impact of her actions. She could be used to feeding large portions and not seeing it as an issue. Also, she might feel defensive if her child is blaming her for their weight, which can be a sensitive topic.\n\nThe author's actions: they are trying to address the problem by talking to their mom calmly and kindly. They're not blaming her outright but are pointing out that her actions contribute. The mom is uncooperative and dismissive. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me analyze. The author is taking responsibility for their health, which is right. However, is their approach appropriate? They are asking their mom to change her behavior to help them, which is a reasonable request. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common parental response that might not acknowledge the author's lack of self-control in those situations. \n\nBut the author is not the one causing the problem here. The mom's cooking and buying habits are part of the environment that makes it hard for the author to manage their weight. The author is not in the wrong for wanting support. They are trying to address a real issue affecting their health. The mom's refusal to help is the problem here, not the author's desire to lose weight or their communication. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could approach the situation differently. Like suggesting healthier options for both of them instead of focusing on blame. But even so, the author isn't in the wrong for needing help. They're not the one overfeeding themselves; the environment is contributing. \n\nSo, the author's actions are justified. They are trying to take control of their health and have communicated their needs. The mom's response is the issue. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
