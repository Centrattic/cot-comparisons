Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author thinking their mom is overfeeding them, and they're struggling with obesity. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and they've tried talking to her about portion sizes and the chocolate. The mom's response is \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author can't help themselves.\n\nSo the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is taking responsibility for their health by trying to address the issue. They've communicated their needs to their mom, but she's not supporting them. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. The author is trying to make changes but feels unsupported. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's response \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common one, but it's not helpful in this context. The author has a lack of self-control in the presence of large portions and unhealthy food. But is that the author's fault? They're trying to manage their eating habits, which is a personal responsibility. However, the environment plays a role too. The mom's cooking and buying habits contribute to the environment that makes it hard for the author to control their eating.\n\nThe author is not in control of their mom's actions. They're doing what they can, but the environment isn't helping. The mom isn't being supportive, which is a problem. The author isn't blaming others; they're trying to address the issue. The key here is that the author is taking steps to improve their health but is facing challenges from their living situation. The mom isn't being blamed directly but is part of the problem. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is trying to take responsibility for their health. The mom's lack of support isn't the author's fault. The author isn't at fault for wanting to improve their situation. They're aware of their problem and are taking steps. The mom's behavior is a barrier, but that doesn't make the author wrong for seeking help. \n\nSo the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They're doing what they can and trying to communicate their needs. The mom's lack of support is an issue, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to address their health.\n"
