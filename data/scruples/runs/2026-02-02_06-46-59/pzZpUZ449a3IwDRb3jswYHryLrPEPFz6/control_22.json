Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which they can't help eating. When the author tells their mom this, she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom is overfeeding them and is partly responsible for their weight, but the mom blames them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong here. The author is trying to address their weight and is seeking support from their mom. They've tried communicating their needs, but the mom isn't providing the help they need. The mom's response is dismissive, which might not be effective, but does that make the author wrong for feeling that way?\n\nThe author isn't eating the food against their will; they are choosing to eat it even though they know it's not helping. However, they mention they have a hard time controlling themselves. The mom's portions and food availability might be contributing factors. The author isn't forcing their mom to do anything; they're asking for help, which the mom isn't giving. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, obesity is a complex issue with many factors. The author's situation is influenced by their own choices and their mom's habits. But since the author is still living with their mom and in a dependent situation, expecting some support is reasonable. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be true, but it ignores the reality of the author's struggle with self-control. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not forcing their mom to cook large portions or buy chocolate. They are expressing their concerns and trying to take responsibility for their health. The mom isn't supporting them, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. The author is seeking help and is aware of their problem, which is a positive step. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
