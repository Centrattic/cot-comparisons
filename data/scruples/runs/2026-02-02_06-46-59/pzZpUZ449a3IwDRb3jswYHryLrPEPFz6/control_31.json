Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's 18 and obese with a BMI of around 40, is living with their mother. The mother also has obesity issues. The author is struggling with overeating, especially when the mother makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has tried to talk to their mom about cutting back, but the mother responds with \"You don't have to eat it\" and blames the author for their weight. The author feels unsupported and is considering moving out to lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author is trying to address their health by managing their diet. They've discussed the issue with their mother, pointing out that the large portions and availability of unhealthy food contribute to their overeating. The mother's response is dismissive, not offering support or making changes. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the mother to cook large portions or buy chocolate; they're asking for help. The mother's behavior might be enabling the overeating by not adjusting portions or limiting access to unhealthy snacks. The author's frustration is understandable because they're trying to make healthy choices but are in an environment that's not supportive. \n\nThe mother's age argument might be a way to avoid responsibility for her own health and the impact her actions have on her son. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable. They haven't been violent or disrespectful; they've tried to communicate calmly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author must take steps to manage their health, the mother has a role in creating an environment that supports those efforts. Blaming the author for their weight without acknowledging the environmental factors isn't helpful. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take control of their health and asking for assistance. They're not making demands beyond reasonable requests for a supportive home environment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're making a valid attempt to address their health with the resources they have and have communicated their needs, even if the mother isn't responding well.\n"
