Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom making large portions and buying lots of chocolate, which the author can't resist leading to obesity. The author feels the mom is contributing to their weight gain and has tried to address it but the mom blames them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is 18, still living with their mom, and has a BMI of 40. They're trying to lose weight but struggle with self-control when there's a lot of food around. The mom, who is also obese, responds with \"you don't have to eat it\" when the author brings up the issue. The author feels the mom isn't helping and is maybe enabling their overeating. They're asking if they're in the wrong for thinking this.\n\nSo, the key points are: The author is trying to manage their weight, the mom's actions (portions and buying chocolate) are part of the environment, and the mom isn't supportive. The author is seeking help but the mom isn't providing it, which the author feels is making it harder. The question is whether the author is at fault for holding their mom responsible.\n\nFrom a health perspective, obesity is a complex issue with many factors. However, the author is clearly taking steps to address their weight. The mom's behavior might be unintentionally contributing, but does that make her at fault? The author is asking if they're wrong to feel that way.\n\nMentally, if someone has a compulsion they can't control, like the author mentions about not being able to resist eating, then the environment plays a role. The mom's portions and the availability of high-calorie snacks could be making it harder for the author. The author is trying to communicate their needs but isn't getting the support they feel is necessary. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive, not acknowledging the author's lack of control.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking initiative by trying to eat healthier, but they're in a situation where their environment isn't supportive. The mom might not realize the impact of her actions, or she might not want to change them. The author isn't blaming the mom out of spite but is seeking support they need. The mom's age argument (X years old) could be a way of deflecting personal responsibility.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to address their health, which is a valid concern. The mom's behavior is part of the issue, but the author is not the one causing the overeating. The mom isn't taking the initiative to help, so the author's frustration is understandable. The author isn't wrong for seeking support and holding their parent accountable for contributing factors. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
