Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is obese, lives with their mom, and the mom is making large portions and buying lots of chocolate. The author tries to tell their mom that this isn't helping, but the mom just says they don't have to eat it. The author feels their mom is overfeeding them and is partly responsible for their weight, but when they bring it up, the mom blames them and doesn't take responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and still living with their mom. They have a BMI around 40, which is in the obese range. They mention that self-control is a problem, which they've told their mom. The mom is also obese. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that the mom is contributing to their weight gain by making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks, and for trying to address it with her.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to take responsibility for their health by addressing the issue. It's reasonable for them to want support from their mom, especially since they live together and she's the one doing the cooking. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might not be helpful, especially if the environment is filled with tempting food. The author isn't saying the mom is the sole cause, but that she's partly responsible by creating an environment that makes it hard for them to eat healthily.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult, albeit 18, and while they're still in a family dynamic, they might be expected to take some initiative in managing their own health. However, given that they've communicated their struggles and the mom isn't providing the support they need, it's not entirely the author's fault. The mom's response of not taking responsibility shifts the blame to the author, which could be invalidating their feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's actions (trying to address the issue) are justified. Since the author is seeking support and has communicated their needs, they aren't in the wrong. The mom's lack of support is a separate issue. The author is taking a positive step by trying to discuss the problem, which is not wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
