Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 18 years old and obese, living with their mother. The mother also has obesity issues. The author is trying to manage their weight but finds it hard because the mother makes large portions and buys lots of chocolate. When the author asks the mother to help by making smaller portions or not buying the chocolate, the mother responds with \"You don't have to eat it.\" The author feels blamed when they try to discuss their weight issues, and the mother dismisses the idea of both losing weight. The author is considering moving out to take control.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult living with their parent, which is common, but they're trying to make lifestyle changes. The mother's response seems dismissive. The author is taking responsibility by trying to lose weight but is struggling with the environment. The mother's behavior\u2014big portions and buying unhealthy food\u2014might contribute to the problem. However, the author is still choosing to eat those portions, so they have agency. But the mother's refusal to support the author's goals could be seen as not helping. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is expressing their needs but is met with resistance. They are not forcing the mother to do anything; they're asking for support. The mother's response is the issue here. The author's frustration is valid because they're trying to improve their health, and the environment isn't conducive. The mother's blame shifts responsibility entirely to the author, which isn't helpful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is still making choices about what and how much to eat. While the environment is a factor, the author has the ability to choose not to eat the portions provided. However, the mother creating an environment that makes it difficult to make healthy choices is a problem. The author's request for help is reasonable, and the mother's refusal or dismissal is the main issue here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking support and taking steps to improve their health. The mother is not providing the necessary support, but that doesn't make the author wrong for wanting to address it. The author's situation is more about needing a supportive environment, which they aren't getting. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are trying to address their health and seeking help, which is valid. The mother's behavior is the problem, not the author's request for support.\n"
