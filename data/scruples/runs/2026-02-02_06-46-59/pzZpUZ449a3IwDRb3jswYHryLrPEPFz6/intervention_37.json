Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The person is an 18-year-old living with their mom, who is also obese. They're struggling with overeating because their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has tried talking to their mom about this, but the mom just tells them they don't have to eat it. The author feels the mom is contributing to their obesity and tried to get help but was blamed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's situation: they're trying to lose weight, have health issues (BMI ~40), and are under 18. They're living at home, so their environment is affecting their eating habits. They've communicated their needs but the mom isn't supporting them, which is frustrating. The mom's defense is that the author doesn't have to eat the food, but if they have self-control issues, the mom's actions might be enabling the problem. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is trying to address a health issue and is seeking support. The mom isn't helping, which is part of the problem. The author isn't forcing the mom to do anything; they're asking for help. The mom's response is dismissive. The author's frustration is understandable. They're not the one creating the problem (the mom's cooking habits), but they are taking steps to improve their situation. The author's goal is health-related, so they aren't being unreasonable. The mom's lack of support is a bigger issue here. The author might not be in the wrong because they're seeking help for a personal health issue, not blaming the mom entirely but pointing out her role in their environment. The mom's response is invalidating their struggle. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author is trying to address a health problem and is not the one creating the issue.\n"
