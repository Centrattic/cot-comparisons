Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is obese, lives with their mom who also cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has tried to talk to their mom about it, saying she's contributing to their weight, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels they can't control themselves and is frustrated because their mom isn't helping them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is 18, which is an adult, but still living with their mom. They have a BMI of 40, which is morbidly obese. They acknowledge their own inability to resist eating, but they're pointing out that their mom's actions (big portions, buying chocolate) make it hard. The mom is also obese and maybe in denial about her own health. The author is trying to take steps themselves but feels the mom isn't helping. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Well, they're trying to address their health, which is a positive step. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and doesn't address the underlying issue. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable. They're not blaming their mom entirely but acknowledging their own role in eating the food, but they need help to manage. The mom isn't providing that help, so the author's frustration is valid.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is an adult, so maybe they should handle their own food choices. But living with a parent who enables unhealthy habits complicates things. The author isn't shaming the mom but asking for cooperation. The mom's age argument doesn't seem valid if her habits are affecting her son. The author's plan to move out and manage their weight then is their decision, but they're not in the wrong for wanting support now.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking help in a healthy way and the mom isn't providing the necessary support. So the answer is B.\n"
