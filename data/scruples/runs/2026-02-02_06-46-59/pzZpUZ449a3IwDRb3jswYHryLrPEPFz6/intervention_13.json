Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is obese with a BMI around 40 and lives with their mother. The mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, but when the author asks her to cut back, the mom responds with \"well you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is contributing to their weight and tried to talk to her, but the mom blames them and says it's up to them to not eat it. The author is trying to lose weight and plans to move out in 4 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18, still living with their mother. They have a weight issue and are trying to address it by changing their diet. The mother's response seems dismissive. But the author is asking if they're wrong for thinking the mom is \"overfeeding\" them.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is trying to take responsibility for their health. They've communicated their needs but feel unsupported. The mother, while also overweight, isn't helping by continuing to provide large portions and unhealthy food. The mother's response might be a defense mechanism, but the author is in a vulnerable position, trying to manage a health issue. \n\nThe key points: The author is trying to make positive changes, which is commendable. They're asking for support from their parent, which is reasonable. The mother isn't providing the support, which complicates the situation. However, the author is still choosing to eat the food, so there's a personal responsibility aspect. But the mother's actions do make it harder for the author to succeed. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting help from their parent. They're not blaming the mom entirely but are seeking support they're not getting. The mother's response is likely due to her own habits or denial, but that doesn't make the author wrong for feeling the need to address it. \n\nSo the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author is trying to improve their health and has a right to ask for support. The mother's lack of support isn't the author's fault. The author isn't making the situation worse; they're seeking help and are taking steps themselves. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
