Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 18 and obese, living with his mother. He's struggling with his weight and feels that his mother's cooking habits\u2014like making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate\u2014are contributing to the problem. He's tried talking to her, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and he feels she's not supporting his efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, even though he's still living at home. His mother is also obese, so maybe she's not modeling healthy behavior. The author is trying to take responsibility for his own health but is finding it hard to manage when the environment isn't supportive. He's asking if he's at fault for thinking his mother is overfeeding him.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" seems dismissive. It's true that the final choice to eat the food is up to the individual, but if someone is struggling with willpower, having a supportive environment is crucial. The mother might not realize how her actions are affecting his ability to control his eating. On the other hand, the author is an adult and should have some autonomy. Maybe he could take steps on his own, like preparing his own meals or not eating the portions she makes. But his point is that he finds it hard to resist, so the environment plays a role.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to address the issue by communicating his needs. The mother isn't supportive, but does that make him wrong? He's not blaming her entirely; he's acknowledging his own responsibility but also asking for help. The key issue is whether he's at fault for holding her accountable for creating an environment that makes it hard for him. Since he's living in her home, maybe there's an expectation of shared habits, but he's trying to make a change. The mother's lack of support complicates things, but he's not entirely wrong to ask for assistance. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
