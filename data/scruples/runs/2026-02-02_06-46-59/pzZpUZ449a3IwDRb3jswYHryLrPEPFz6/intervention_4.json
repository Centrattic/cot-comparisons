Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mother is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and has tried to communicate their issues with portion sizes and the availability of unhealthy food. The mom's response is to say that the author doesn't have to eat what's served, which the author finds unhelpful because they struggle with self-control.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The author's main issue is that their mom isn't helping them with their weight problem by adjusting portions or reducing unhealthy foods. The mom's BMI isn't specified, but she's also obese. The author feels responsible for their own actions but is seeking help from their mom, who's not providing it. \n\nThe author is trying to take steps to lose weight, which is a positive sign. They've communicated their needs to their mom, but the mom isn't supporting them, instead blaming the author for not controlling their eating. The author's frustration comes from feeling unsupported in their health goals. \n\nNow, considering typical family dynamics, parents often have to balance their child's needs with their own habits. Since the author is still living at home, it's reasonable for them to ask for a supportive environment. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive because it doesn't acknowledge the author's struggle with self-control. The author isn't making their mom do anything; they're asking for assistance, which is a valid request. \n\nHowever, there's a question of personal responsibility. The author is an adult (18 years old), so they have some autonomy. They could take steps to manage their own diet, like preparing their own meals or eating separately. But the mom's role in providing food that contributes to the problem might still be a factor. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't wrong for wanting support. The mom isn't wrong for having her own habits, but the author's request for help isn't unreasonable. Since the author is seeking advice on whether they're in the wrong, it's more about the mom's lack of support rather than the author's actions. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're seeking a supportive environment and have communicated their needs, while the mom isn't providing the necessary help. The author's actions are about self-improvement, and the mom's response is dismissive.\n"
