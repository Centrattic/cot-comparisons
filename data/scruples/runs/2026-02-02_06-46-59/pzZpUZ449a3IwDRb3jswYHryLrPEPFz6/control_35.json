Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about the person thinking their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the kid asks her to stop, she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The person is struggling with self-control and wants help from their mom, but the mom isn't supportive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is 18, living with their mom, and has a BMI of around 40, which is in the obese range. They want to lose weight and have tried talking to their mom, but she's not helping. The mom is also obese. The user is asking if they are at fault here.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and control. The mom is preparing the food, making large portions, and buying unhealthy snacks. The person is honest about their inability to control their eating when such food is available. The mom's response is dismissive, not offering support. \n\nThe person isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight issue but is asking for help. They acknowledge they need to take some responsibility but feel the mom is contributing. The question is whether the person is wrong for thinking the mom is overfeeding them and needing help.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, when someone is trying to change their habits, support from family is important. If the environment is making it harder (like having access to large portions and unhealthy food), it's reasonable to ask for help creating a supportive environment. The mom's lack of support here isn't helping the person's efforts.\n\nHowever, the person is still responsible for their own choices. But the question is about whether they're wrong to feel the mom is part of the problem. Since the mom is contributing to the environment that makes it hard for the person to control their eating, the person isn't wrong to seek help. They are in a vulnerable position and trying to address a health issue. The mom's response is not helpful, but the person isn't at fault for trying to get support.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
