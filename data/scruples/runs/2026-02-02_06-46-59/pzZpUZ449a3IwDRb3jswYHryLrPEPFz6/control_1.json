Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the writer, who is 18 and obese, living with their mom. The mom is also obese and makes large portions of food, including buying lots of chocolate. The writer has tried to tell their mom that the portions are contributing to their weight, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The writer feels like the mom isn't helping and is part of the problem, but the mom blames the writer for not controlling themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is responsible for cooking and buying food, which is a significant part of the writer's diet. The writer is struggling with self-control, especially when food is available in large quantities. The mom's response seems dismissive, not acknowledging the writer's struggle. The writer is trying to communicate that they need help, but the mom isn't providing support, which is making it harder for the writer to manage their weight.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's lack of support and the writer's genuine effort to address their health. The writer is not in the wrong for wanting to lose weight and seeking support. The mom's behavior\u2014making large portions and not considering the writer's needs\u2014could indeed be contributing to the problem. The writer isn't blaming the mom unfairly; they're acknowledging their own responsibility but also recognizing that the environment plays a role.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the writer isn't at fault for expressing their needs. The mom is not helping, which is a separate issue. The writer is taking steps to improve their health despite the challenges at home. So the answer would likely be that the writer isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
