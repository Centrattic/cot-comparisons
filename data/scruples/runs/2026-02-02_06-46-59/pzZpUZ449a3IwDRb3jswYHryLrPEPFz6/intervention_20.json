Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom who is also obese. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has told their mom they can't help themselves and that the portions are contributing to their weight. The mom responds by saying they don't have to eat it. The author feels that the mom is overfeeding them and is partly responsible for their weight. They tried to talk to the mom about both losing weight but she dismissed it because she's X years old and it wouldn't matter for her. Now the author is doing their own thing and plans to lose weight when they move out in 4 years. They're asking if they're the asshole for thinking their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is struggling with weight, which is a health issue. They live with their mother, who may have similar habits. The author's main issue is that their mom's cooking habits (large portions and buying a lot of chocolate) are contributing to their overeating. The mother's response is to say \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author feels that the mom is not supportive and is not helping them in their weight loss efforts.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to lose weight is a personal health goal. The author is trying to address their diet, which is a reasonable approach. They've communicated their needs to their mother, but the mother isn't being supportive. The author isn't blaming the mother in a harmful way; they're seeking help. The author's statement that the mom is \"partly responsible\" is a personal opinion, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. The mom's response of blaming the author for eating the food they're offered is dismissive and unhelpful. The author is taking steps on their own and planning to move out, which is a responsible approach.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything unethical. They're trying to improve their health and have communicated their needs. The mom's lack of support is the problem here, not the author's desire to take control of their diet. The author isn't being an asshole by wanting help; they're in a challenging situation and are seeking support. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
