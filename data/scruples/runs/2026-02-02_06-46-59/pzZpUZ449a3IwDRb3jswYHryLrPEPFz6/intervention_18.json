Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. The author is obese and trying to lose weight, but their mom doesn't help by not reducing the portions or the amount of unhealthy food. The author feels their mom is \"overfeeding\" them and has tried talking to her, but she blames them and says they don't have to eat it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's perspective is that they have a problem resisting food when their mom provides so much, especially unhealthy options. They're trying to lose weight and need their mom's help, but she doesn't cooperate. The mom's response is dismissive, which the author finds unhelpful.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that she's not responsible for her child's eating habits once they're an adult. She might see it as the author's responsibility to manage their own diet, even if she's providing food. Also, she might not realize how her actions are affecting the author's health. But the author is still living at home and the mom is preparing the food, so there's a shared living situation that complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are accountability and mutual responsibility. The author is trying to take steps to improve their health but needs support. The mom's refusal to adjust might hinder those efforts. However, the author is also an adult and capable of making their own choices. The mom might not be obligated to change her habits unless they're directly harmful, but in this case, the food environment could contribute to the author's health issues.\n\nBut the author isn't blaming the mom for their entire weight problem, just pointing out that the mom's overfeeding makes it harder. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" could be seen as dismissive and not considering the author's struggle with self-control. The author is seeking support, which is reasonable. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to address a problem and need help, which the mom isn't providing. The mom's behavior could be contributing to the issue, so the author's frustration is understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
