Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The situation is that the author is obese, lives with their mom, and the mom makes large portions and buys a lot of food. The author can't control themselves and wants help, but the mom is blaming the author for eating too much. The author is frustrated and feels unsupported.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They\u2019re trying to address their weight issue by controlling their diet. They\u2019ve tried to communicate their needs to their mom but haven't gotten the support they wanted. The mom's response is to say \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author is taking responsibility by trying to eat less and plans to move out to manage their weight better. So from their side, they\u2019re trying to make a positive change and are asking for support, which the mom isn't giving.\n\nNow, the mom's side: she might feel that the author has control over their own eating habits. She might not realize how much the environment affects behavior, like portion sizes and having tempting foods around. Her response could be due to a lack of understanding of how peer pressure and environment influence eating. Maybe she's not intentionally being harmful but isn't aware of how her actions contribute to the problem.\n\nFrom a general perspective, the author is trying to address a health issue and is seeking support. The mom isn't providing that support, which is a common issue in family dynamics. The author isn't blaming the mom solely but is acknowledging their own role in eating habits. However, the author is also pointing out that the environment is contributing. It's possible that the author is in a difficult position where they need help but aren't getting it.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author is expressing their needs and trying to take responsibility by making changes. They\u2019re not attacking the mom but are seeking her help. The mom's refusal to adjust might be part of the problem. The author's actions are about self-improvement and health, which are valid concerns. The key here is that the author is trying to address the issue constructively despite the mom's lack of support. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong. They\u2019re trying to take steps to improve their health, and it's reasonable to ask for support in that journey. The mom's response is the issue here, not the author's request for help.\n"
