Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, who is 18 and obese, feeling that their mother's large food portions and buying of unhealthy snacks contribute to their weight. The author tried to talk to their mom about it, but she keeps responding with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author feels their mom is partly responsible and is now taking steps on their own, planning to move out in four years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18) living with their mom, who also has weight issues. The author is trying to manage their weight but finds it hard to resist the food their mom provides. The mom's responses are dismissive, not offering support. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why would that be? Maybe because the author is blaming their mom instead of taking personal responsibility? Or perhaps because they aren't taking enough action themselves despite the mom's lack of support?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom might not realize how her actions are affecting her son. She's also obese, so maybe she's not in a place to help. The author is trying to communicate their needs but isn't getting the support they want. \n\nThe key point is responsibility. The author is an adult, so some might argue they should take full responsibility for their own choices, even if their mom's habits make it harder. However, the author is clearly struggling with self-control and has asked for help. The mom isn't providing that help, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to lose weight and seeking support. The mom isn't in the wrong if she's not intentionally enabling the behavior, but her response isn't helpful. The author's frustration is valid. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, I need to decide. If the author is taking steps despite their mom's lack of support, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if they're placing blame on their mom instead of taking full personal responsibility, that could be where the fault lies. However, the author is honest about their struggle with self-control, so it's not entirely their fault. \n\nThe answer likely is B (author not in the wrong) because the mom's lack of support is part of the issue, and the author is trying their best under the circumstances. The author's actions are reasonable given the situation. They're not being inconsiderate; they're trying to improve their health but need help they're not receiving. The mom's responses are dismissive, so the author isn't at fault here.\n"
