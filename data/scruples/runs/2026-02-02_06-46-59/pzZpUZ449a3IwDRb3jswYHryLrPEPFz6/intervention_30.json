Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given post is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old who lives with their mom and is obese. They feel their mom is overfeeding them by making huge portions and buying lots of chocolate. When they ask their mom to help, she says \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The author argues that their mom is partly responsible for their weight and that they need her support to lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main issue is that they struggle with self-control around food and feel their mom isn't supporting them by making unhealthy portions and snacks available. The mom, on the other hand, is responding with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which might be her way of maintaining her own habits while pushing responsibility onto the author. The author is trying to take steps to improve their health but feels hindered by their mom's actions.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong: The author is seeking help to address their health issue, which is a valid concern. They are trying to communicate their needs to their mom, which is a responsible action. However, blaming the mom entirely for their weight might not consider the role of personal responsibility. The author is an adult (18), so they have some autonomy, even if they live with their mom. The mom's responses might be dismissive, but the author could also take steps to manage their intake independently, like preparing their own meals or finding ways to cope with the available food.\n\nBut the key point here is the author's struggle with self-control and the environment their mom creates. The mom's denial of any responsibility might be a barrier to the author's efforts. The author isn't wrong for wanting to lose weight and seeking support. However, expecting the mom to completely change her habits just for the author might be unrealistic. The author could be taking more initiative in their own health, but given the situation, their feelings are valid.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a legitimate health concern and are trying to address it. The mom's lack of support complicates things, but the author's desire to improve their health is commendable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
