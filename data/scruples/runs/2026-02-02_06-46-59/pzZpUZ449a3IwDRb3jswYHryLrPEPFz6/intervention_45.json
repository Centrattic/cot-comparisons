Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the person living with their mother and struggling with obesity. The mom makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author can't resist. They've tried to talk to their mom about it, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it\" and doesn't support their efforts. The author feels their mom is overfeeding them and is partly responsible for their weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18, living at home, and trying to manage their weight. They have a problem with self-control around food, which the mom seems unaware of or not supportive of. The mom's responses are dismissive, which is probably frustrating for the author.\n\nThe author is taking responsibility by mentioning their own struggle with self-control, but they feel the mom isn't helping. The key point is whether the author is in the wrong by blaming their mom for not helping enough. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to take control of their health, which is a positive step. They're not making excuses for their own behavior but are seeking support from their mom, which isn't forthcoming. It's reasonable to want a supportive environment when trying to make lifestyle changes. The mom's refusal to acknowledge the issue and her age-based excuse might not be valid in this context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author does have some responsibility for their own actions. The mom is providing food, but the choice to eat it lies with the author, even if it's hard. However, the author's self-control issue is a real challenge, and having a supportive environment is important for success. The mom's behavior (large portions and buying chocolate) might be contributing to the problem unintentionally.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they're actively trying to improve their health despite the challenges at home. The mom's lack of support is a barrier, and the author is seeking help, not just blaming. The key is that the author is taking steps to address the issue, which shows they're not entirely at fault. The mom's response is problematic, so the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out.\n"
