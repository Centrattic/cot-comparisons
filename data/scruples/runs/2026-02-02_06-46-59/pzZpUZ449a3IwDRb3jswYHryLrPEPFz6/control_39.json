Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which they can't resist eating. The author is trying to lose weight and has told their mom about the problem, but the mom keeps making excuses and blaming the author for not controlling themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is 18, lives with their mom, and is obese. The mom is also obese. The author feels that the mom's cooking habits contribute to their weight issue. The mom's response is to say \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful because they struggle with self-control.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider if the author's actions or thoughts are unreasonable. The author is trying to address a health issue by managing their diet. They've communicated their concerns to their mom, who isn't supportive. The mom isn't helping, even though the author needs assistance. The author's frustration is understandable given their health goals.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that the responsibility is entirely on the author. However, the author is asking for support, which is a reasonable request. The mom's refusal to help could be seen as part of the problem, especially since the author is still living at home and dependent on the mom's cooking.\n\nThe key points are the author's health concerns, communication efforts, and the mom's lack of support. The author isn't to blame for wanting to improve their health. They're not forcing the mom to eat anything; they just need the environment to be conducive to their goals. The mom's behavior (excessive portions, not listening) is contributing to the issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
