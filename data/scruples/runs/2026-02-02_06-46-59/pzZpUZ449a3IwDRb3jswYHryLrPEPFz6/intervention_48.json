Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author, who is 18 and obese, is living with their mother. They mention that the mother makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author asks her to stop, the mother responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mother is contributing to their weight issues and tried to talk to her, but the mother blames them. The author is now taking steps on their own and plans to move out in 4 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is struggling with weight and eating habits. They're trying to get help from their mother, who isn't providing the support they need. The mother's responses seem dismissive. The author is taking initiative by trying to manage their own diet now.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, they are trying to address their health, which is a valid concern. However, they might be placing responsibility on their mother for their own weight. The mother's actions (big portions, buying chocolate) are environmental factors, but the author has the autonomy to choose what they eat. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is true in a sense, but maybe not supportive. The author's frustration is understandable, but they might need to take more personal responsibility for their choices, even if their environment isn't ideal.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother isn't helping, which isn't the author's fault. The author is doing what they can and plans to take more control when they move out. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for placing blame on the mother. It's a complex situation where both could have done more, but the author is taking steps toward their own health. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're addressing their issue and can't control their mother's behavior.\n"
