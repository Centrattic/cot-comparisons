Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is obese with a BMI around 40, lives with their mom who is also obese, and has tried to address the issue of large portions and availability of unhealthy food. The mom's response is to tell the author they don't have to eat everything, but the author struggles to resist.\n\nFirst, the author is an 18-year-old trying to manage their weight. They've communicated their concerns to their mother, who isn't supportive and instead blames them. The author's goal is to lose weight and is taking steps themselves, but feels their mom is contributing to the problem. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent to improve their health and the communication attempts. The mom's refusal to help or adjust portions, despite being aware of the issue, could be seen as not supporting the author's goals. The author isn't blaming their mom solely but is pointing out that the environment (large portions and easy access to unhealthy food) makes it harder for them to control their eating. \n\nHowever, the author is still living at home, and their mom may not have control over the author's choices once they're there. The author's responsibility is to make their own choices, but it's harder in an environment that isn't supportive. The author isn't wrong for seeking support from their family, especially given their age and the influence of the home environment. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. Their mom isn't helping, and the author is trying to take steps towards healthier living despite the challenges. The answer is B.\n"
