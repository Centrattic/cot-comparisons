Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person from the AITA post is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese, lives with their mom, and the mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author can't control themselves and ends up eating it even though they know they shouldn't. They tried talking to their mom, but she keeps saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and wants help, but the mom doesn't support them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18) but still living with their parent. The mom's behavior might contribute to the author's struggles, but is the author in the wrong for pointing that out? The author isn't blaming the mom entirely, just acknowledging that the environment makes it hard. The mom isn't providing support, which complicates things. \n\nThe author is taking steps to improve their health, which is positive. However, the question is whether they're wrong for holding their mom accountable. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive, not helping the author's self-control issues. The author's self-control is a personal challenge, but the environment plays a role. \n\nIs the author at fault for not taking full responsibility? Maybe not. They're seeking help and have a valid point about the environment. The mom's lack of support is an issue here. The author isn't attacking the mom's health but asking for assistance. The key is that the author is trying to make changes and the mom isn't helping. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for needing that support. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
