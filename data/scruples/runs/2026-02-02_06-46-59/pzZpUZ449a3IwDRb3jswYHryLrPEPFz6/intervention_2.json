Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity. The author is 18, living with their mom, and trying to lose weight. They mention that they can't control themselves when there's a lot of food, especially when their mom makes big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. They tried talking to their mom, but she just says \"you don't have to eat it,\" and now the author is feeling blamed and not supported.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to take responsibility for their health by addressing the food issue. They've communicated their struggles to their mother, but the mother isn't providing the support they need. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" could be seen as dismissive. The author isn't asking to be forced to eat; they're asking for an environment that supports their goals. The mom's actions\u2014making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate\u2014might be contributing to the problem, especially if the author has a hard time resisting.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them? Well, the author is trying to make a change and has communicated their needs. The mom isn't adjusting her behavior, which could be a lack of support. The author isn't forcing the mom to do anything; they're seeking help. The mom's age and her own weight might be part of why she's not taking it seriously, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to ask for a healthier environment.\n\nSo, the author is trying to take steps to improve their health and has discussed the issue with their mom. The mom isn't providing the necessary support, which is a common issue in family dynamics. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the problem and asking for help. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
