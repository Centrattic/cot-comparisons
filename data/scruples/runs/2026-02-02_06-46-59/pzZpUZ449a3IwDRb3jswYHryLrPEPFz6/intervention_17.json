Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThe author is 18 years old and living with their mom. They're obese with a BMI around 40. They're trying to lose weight but find it hard because their mom keeps making huge portions and buying a lot of chocolate. When the author asks their mom to stop, the mom responds with \"Well you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels like the mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to talk to her about it, but the mom blames them and says it's their choice. The author wants to lose weight and thinks moving out in 4 years will help, but they're asking if they're in the wrong for feeling this way.\n\nHmm. The author is trying to take responsibility for their own health, which is admirable. They're aware of their weight and the need to change their diet. The mom's actions\u2014making large portions and buying chocolate\u2014might be contributing to the problem. But the mom is also obese herself, so maybe she's not in the best position to help. However, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking the mom is overfeeding them and being frustrated with her lack of support.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're asking for help, and the mom isn't providing it. The mom's response is dismissive. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to address the situation. The problem might be that the author is placing some of the blame on the mom for their weight. While the mom's habits might make it harder, the author is an adult (18 years old) and has the autonomy to make their own choices. However, the author is still living at home and might be influenced by the environment they're in.\n\nBut the author is trying to take steps on their own now. They might not be in the wrong for expressing their feelings about the situation. The mom's response is unhelpful, but the author is still taking initiative. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author could be more responsible for their own actions regardless of the mom's habits. But since the author is struggling with self-control and has communicated this to their mom without getting support, their position seems reasonable. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
