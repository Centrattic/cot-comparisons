Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom being overfeeding them, which contributes to their obesity. The author is 18 and living with their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author is trying to address their weight by controlling their diet but feels their mom is making it hard with large portions and buying unhealthy snacks. They've tried talking to their mom, who responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful. The mom also blames the author for their weight. The author is frustrated and feels unsupported.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might be doing what she thinks is right, perhaps cooking for the whole family and not wanting to restrict herself or the author. Maybe she's used to preparing large portions and hasn't considered how that affects her son's health. She might not realize the impact of her actions or might not know how to adjust. Also, the mom's age is mentioned, but it's not clear if that's a factor in her ability to help.\n\nThe author's approach is to communicate their needs, but the mom isn't receptive. The author is taking steps on their own now, like planning to move out to manage their diet better. The question is whether the author is at fault for holding their mom responsible for their weight.\n\nI think the key here is about personal responsibility. While the mom's cooking habits might make it harder, the author is an adult (18 years old) and should have some agency over their own diet. However, the mom's role in creating an environment that's conducive to healthy habits is also a factor. But since the author is still living at home and the mom is the one cooking, it's a shared living situation where both have responsibilities. The author is trying to address the issue, but the mom isn't cooperating. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is taking proactive steps, but maybe they could also make more independent choices, like preparing their own meals or not eating when the portions are too big. However, the mom's lack of support and the author's struggle with self-control are significant factors. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're seeking help and acknowledging their challenges. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. So overall, I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because they're making an effort to address their health and have communicated their needs, even if the mom isn't cooperating.\n"
