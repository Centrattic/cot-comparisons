Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their mother. The author is obese and lives with their mother, who makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author tells their mom to stop, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is overfeeding them and is blaming them for their weight, so they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid concern about their health and is trying to manage their weight. Their mom's cooking and buying habits might be contributing factors. But does the author have the right to tell their mom to change her behavior? Is it the mom's responsibility to control the author's eating habits, especially since the author is an adult (18 years old)?\n\nWait, the author is 18, which is an adult in many places, but they still live with their mom. So maybe the dynamic is that the mom is used to taking care of them. The author is trying to take control of their health, which is understandable. However, the author's approach might be confrontational. They told their mom she's partly responsible, which could be seen as placing blame. The mom's response is to deflect, which is typical in such situations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for holding their mom accountable for their eating habits? The key point here is responsibility. The author's choice to eat what's available is their own decision. While the mom's portion sizes and habits might make it harder, the author still has the agency to choose not to eat. However, the author mentions a lack of self-control, so they're not entirely to blame. But is the mom responsible for the author's weight? Probably not solely. The author's own choices play a role.\n\nThe author is trying to seek help from their mom, which is reasonable. If the mom isn't providing that support, maybe the author needs to take more personal responsibility. But the author is in a difficult position because they're still living at home. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling the mom is overfeeding them. I think the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their concerns, but maybe they need to approach it differently. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nIn terms of accountability, while the mom's actions might contribute, the author's own decisions are a factor. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they also aren't completely right. The answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to address a health issue and the mom's response is not helpful. The author's intention is to improve their health, which is valid. The mom's portion sizes might be part of the problem, but the author's self-control is another aspect. However, the author is taking steps to manage their weight once they move out, which shows initiative. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
