Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which the author finds hard to resist, contributing to their obesity. The author tried to talk to their mom, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and when they suggest losing weight, she dismisses it because of her age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and lives with their mom. They have a BMI around 40, which is morbidly obese. The mom is also obese. The author is struggling with self-control around food, especially when the mom provides large portions and junk food. The mom's response is to blame the author, which isn't helpful.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the mom's habits are contributing to the problem. Even if the mom isn't directly forcing the author to eat, creating an environment with excessive unhealthy food can make it harder for someone trying to diet. The author is seeking support, which the mom isn't providing. The mom's age argument also seems like an excuse not to address her own health issues.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting to take steps to improve their health. It's reasonable to ask for support from family, especially when living together. The mom's behavior is enabling the problem, and the author is trying to take responsibility by planning to move out and start their own healthy habits. \n\nThe key points are that the author is dealing with a challenging environment and is making an effort to change, while the mom isn't providing the necessary support. The author isn't at fault here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
