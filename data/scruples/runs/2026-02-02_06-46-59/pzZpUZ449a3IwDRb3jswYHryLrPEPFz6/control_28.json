Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 18 and obese, lives with their mother who also has a high BMI. The author is trying to lose weight and has asked their mom to stop making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks, like chocolate. But when the author tries to talk to their mom, the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it\" and refuses to take responsibility. The author is frustrated because they can't control themselves around the food and feel unsupported.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions or expectations are unreasonable. The author is clearly trying to take steps to improve their health, which is positive. They've communicated their needs to their mother, but the mother isn't supporting them. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" doesn't address the author's struggle with self-control. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting their mom to help? Probably not. It's reasonable to ask for a supportive environment when trying to make lifestyle changes, especially when there's a known issue with self-control. The mother's refusal to help and blaming the child for not having self-control seems more problematic. The author isn't asking their mom to do something harmful; just to adjust some habits to support their health goals.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's own health, maybe she could benefit from similar changes. But the author's request is specific to their own needs. Since the mother isn't providing the support the author is asking for, it's not the author's fault. The author is taking initiative to improve their situation, which is commendable. They're not in the wrong for seeking help from their parent, even if the parent isn't cooperating. The key point is that the author is making a reasonable request and isn't at fault for the mother's response. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
