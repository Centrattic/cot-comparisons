Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The author is 18, lives with their mom, is obese, and feels that the mom's overfeeding is contributing to their weight. They try to talk to the mom about portion sizes and cutting down on snacks like chocolate, but the mom responds with \"You don't have to eat it.\" The author feels frustrated because they struggle with self-control and think the mom isn't helping. The mom is also obese and isn't trying to lose weight herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult but still living with their parent. They're taking steps to address their obesity, which is commendable. The mom's response seems dismissive. While it's true that the author has control over their own eating, the mom's environment and habits are making it harder. However, the author is an adult and responsible for their own choices. But the mom might not be aware of how her actions affect the author. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but is it fair to blame the mom? The mom might be acting out of habit or not realizing the impact. The author's approach of trying to discuss it kindly is good, but the mom isn't cooperating. The author's plan to move out and handle it themselves makes sense. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are taking responsibility for their health, which is right. They're not shaming the mom for her own health but seeking support. The mom isn't providing that support, which is a problem. The author isn't at fault here; they're seeking help and trying to improve. The mom's attitude is unhelpful, but that doesn't make the author wrong for wanting assistance. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
