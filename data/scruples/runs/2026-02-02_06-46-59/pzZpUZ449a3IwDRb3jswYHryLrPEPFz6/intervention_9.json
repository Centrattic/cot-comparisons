Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 18 years old, lives with their mother, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They want to lose weight and have approached their mother about the issue. The mother cooks large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when the author asks her to stop, the mother says, \"Well you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that the mother is contributing to their weight problem and tried to get help, but the mother blames them instead. The author now plans to handle it themselves and lose weight after moving out in 4 years.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions seem positive\u2014they want to improve their health. They've tried communicating their needs to their mother, which is a reasonable step. The mother's response is dismissive, not helpful. The key issue here is the mother's behavior. Making large portions and buying unhealthy food isn't inherently wrong, but since the child is trying to lose weight, the mother's actions are hindering their efforts. The author is asking if they're at fault for pointing this out.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs. It's reasonable to ask a family member for support when working on a personal health goal. The mother's refusal to help and blaming the child is problematic. The author is taking steps on their own, which is commendable. The fact that the author is still trying despite the lack of support shows their commitment. So, the wrong here is more on the mother's side for not being supportive. The author is not at fault for seeking help and acknowledging the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
