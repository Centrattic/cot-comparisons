Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is 18 years old and obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mother. The mother is also obese and cooks large portions, including unhealthy foods like chocolate. The author has tried to communicate their struggles with overeating and has asked the mother to help by not overfeeding them, but the mother responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it\" and doesn't take their concerns seriously. The author feels unsupported and is considering moving out to take control of their diet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is at fault. The author is trying to address a problem they have\u2014a weight issue that they want to manage by controlling their diet. They've communicated their needs to their mother, who isn't providing the support they need. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and not helpful, especially since the author has admitted to struggles with self-control around food. The mother's lack of action, like continuing to make large portions and buy unhealthy snacks, could be contributing to the author's difficulty in managing their weight.\n\nThe key points here are communication and responsibility. The author isn't asking for someone else to fix their weight; they're asking for support and understanding from their mother. The mother's refusal to adjust her cooking habits, despite being informed of the negative impact, might mean she's not being supportive. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to make healthier choices and seeking help from a parent. It's reasonable for them to feel frustrated when their requests are ignored or dismissed.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that the mother might not realize the full extent of the issue or might be struggling with her own health habits. But the author's intent is to seek support, not blame the mother for their weight. The mother's response is the issue here, not the author's initial request for help. The author is taking steps to improve their situation, which is positive. They\u2019re not shaming the mother but rather trying to work together for better health. Since the mother isn't providing the necessary support, the author's frustration is justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re seeking help and have communicated their needs, which the mother isn't meeting. The mother's actions (or lack thereof) are contributing to the problem, so the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
