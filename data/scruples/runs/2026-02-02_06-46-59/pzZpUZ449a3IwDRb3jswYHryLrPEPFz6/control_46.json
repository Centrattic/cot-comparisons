Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author living with their mom, who makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author is obese and has a BMI around 40, which is in the obese range. They're trying to lose weight but find it hard to resist the food their mom provides. The mom's response is always \"you don't have to eat it,\" and when the author points out that the mom's habits contribute to their weight, she blames them and says she doesn't care about her own weight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. From the description, the author is trying to address their health issue and is seeking support from their mother. The mother, however, isn't providing the support and instead is enabling the behavior by making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks. The author is not in the wrong for acknowledging that their mother's actions make it harder for them to control their eating. It's reasonable to ask for help when trying to lose weight, especially when the environment contributes to overeating. The mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is dismissive and not helpful. The author isn't blaming the mother entirely, but they are pointing out that the mother's habits are part of the problem. Since the author is taking steps to improve their health and is seeking support, they aren't the asshole here. The mother isn't helping, but the author's intentions are valid. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
