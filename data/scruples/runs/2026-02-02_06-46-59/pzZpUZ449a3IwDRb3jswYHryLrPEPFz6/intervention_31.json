Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mom making large portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which the author can't resist. The author feels that the mom is contributing to their obesity and has tried to talk to her, but the mom blames the author and says they don't have to eat it. The author is 18, still living with their mom, and considering moving out to lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who is at fault here. The author is trying to address their own health issues, which is understandable. They have a high BMI and want to change their diet. However, they live with their mom, who is also obese and makes large portions. The author feels that the mom's actions make it harder for them to control their eating. They've tried to communicate their needs but the mom isn't helping. \n\nThe author is taking steps on their own now, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The key points here are about personal responsibility and the environment. The author's mom is providing the food, but the author is the one who eats it. However, the author also mentions that they have a hard time resisting, which is a personal struggle. \n\nThe mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might seem dismissive. It's possible that the mom isn't fully aware of the impact her actions have on the author's ability to control their eating. Or maybe she is, but doesn't see it as her problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the mom's portion sizes and buying habits might contribute, the author's choice to eat more than necessary is their own decision. However, the author is in a vulnerable position, with a known issue of overeating. The mom could be more supportive by adjusting her habits, but she isn't. \n\nThe author is trying to take initiative but feels unsupported. The question is whether it's fair for the author to hold their mom responsible. On one hand, she's creating an environment that makes it harder for the author to eat healthily. On the other hand, the author has the agency to make choices, even if it's difficult. \n\nBut considering that the author is 18 and still living with their mom, the dynamics might be different. They might be in a dependent situation where the mom's habits significantly affect their environment. The mom's refusal to change her behavior despite being told could be seen as not helping, but does that make her the problem?\n\nThe author's actions in trying to communicate their needs are reasonable. The mom's responses are unhelpful, but the author's own overeating is a personal struggle. However, the mom's actions do play a role in enabling that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them? I don't think so. They're trying to address a problem that is influenced by both their own habits and their mom's. The mom's behavior isn't helpful, but the author isn't at fault for wanting a healthier environment. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
