Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for thinking their mom is \"overfeeding\" them. The author is 18, lives with their mother, and is obese with a BMI around 40. They mention that their mother makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they ask her to stop, she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that their mom is partially responsible for their weight and tried to talk to her about it, but she blamed them instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult (18) living with their mother. They're trying to take control of their health by addressing their diet. The mother's response is dismissive, which could be frustrating for the author. The key points are the author's attempt to communicate their needs and the mother's lack of support.\n\nThe author is not blaming the mother solely but is expressing difficulty in resisting the food they're exposed to. The mother's behavior, like making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks, might contribute to the author's struggle. However, the author is an adult, so the question is whether they have a responsibility to manage their own eating habits regardless of the environment.\n\nOn one hand, the author is seeking support to make healthier choices, which is reasonable. It's important to have a supportive environment when trying to make lifestyle changes. The mother's refusal to adjust portions or reduce unhealthy snacks might hinder the author's efforts. On the other hand, the author is an adult, and while the environment helps, the responsibility for personal health choices ultimately lies with the individual. They can't force their mother to change, but they can make their own choices despite the environment.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but pointing fingers at the mother (even if only partially) could be seen as shifting responsibility. However, given the mother's lack of support, the author's request for help isn't unreasonable. The challenge is balancing personal responsibility with the need for a supportive environment.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the key is whether the author is wrong for their perspective. The author is trying to address their health, which is a positive step. They're not attacking their mother but seeking assistance they're not getting. The mother's response is the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the situation. They might need to take further steps independently if the mother isn't supportive, but their initial stance isn't unreasonable.\n"
