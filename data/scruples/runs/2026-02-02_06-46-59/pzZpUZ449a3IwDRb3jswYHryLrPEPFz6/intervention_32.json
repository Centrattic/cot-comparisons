Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is living with their mom, both are obese, and the mom makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author can't control themselves and wants the mom to help by not making so much food, but the mom keeps saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and still living with their mom. The mom's behavior, like making huge portions and buying a lot of chocolate, is part of the environment the author is dealing with. The author is struggling with self-control and has communicated their needs to the mom, but the mom isn't cooperating. \n\nThe key points here are about personal responsibility versus environmental factors. The author is trying to take control of their health, which is a positive step. However, the mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive of the author's struggle with self-control. The author is trying to take responsibility by seeking help, but the mom isn't providing that support. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult now (18), so there's an expectation that they can make their own choices. Even if the mom makes big portions, the author still has the choice to eat or not. However, the author is struggling with self-control, which is a real issue. The mom's behavior might be contributing to the problem, but it's not the only factor. \n\nThe author is also considering moving out, which would give them more control over their environment. The fact that they're trying to do things on their own now suggests they're taking steps toward responsibility. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for holding their mom accountable for part of their weight issue? Well, while the mom's actions might contribute, ultimately, the author has the agency to choose how much to eat. The mom might not be malicious, just perhaps not understanding the author's specific situation. \n\nHowever, the author's frustration is understandable. They've communicated their needs, and the mom isn't supporting them. The author isn't asking the mom to force them to eat less, just to reduce the availability of food that tempts them. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that the author is not in the wrong. They're seeking help and taking responsibility where they can. The mom's lack of support is a barrier, but that doesn't make the author wrong for wanting assistance. On the flip side, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The author's age and responsibility for their own actions also play a role. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author is trying to address their health and has communicated their needs, even if the mom isn't supporting them. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for seeking help in this situation.\n"
