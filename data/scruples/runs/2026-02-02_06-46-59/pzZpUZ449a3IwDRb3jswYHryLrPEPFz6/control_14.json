Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is 18, obese, living with their mother, who is also obese. The author feels that their mom's overfeeding is contributing to their weight problem. The mother responds by saying \"you don't have to eat it\" and blames the author for their weight, not offering help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to address a health issue, which is a valid concern. They've communicated their struggles with portion control and the mother's cooking habits. The mother's response is dismissive and places the responsibility solely on the author, which isn't helpful. The author is seeking support, not blame.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, having a supportive environment is crucial for making lifestyle changes. If the mother isn't providing that support, it's reasonable for the author to feel frustrated. The mother's behavior might stem from her own issues, like her own weight and possible lack of understanding about healthy habits.\n\nHowever, the author is still an adult (18) and ultimately responsible for their own dietary choices. But given their age and still living at home, the situation might involve dependency. The mother's role in providing a healthy home environment is significant. By making large portions and buying unhealthy snacks, she's creating an environment that makes it harder for the author to manage their weight.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is at fault for wanting to address this. The author isn't blaming the mother for their weight entirely but is pointing out that the mother's actions contribute to the problem. The mother isn't helping, which is a problem. The author is trying to take steps on their own but needs support, which isn't being given.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author has control over their actions, the mother's behavior is part of the environment they're in. It's reasonable for the author to ask for a supportive environment. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their needs and acknowledging the mother's role in their challenges. The mother's refusal to support is the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
