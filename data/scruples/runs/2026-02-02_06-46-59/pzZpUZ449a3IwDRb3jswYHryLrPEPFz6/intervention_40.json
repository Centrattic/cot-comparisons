Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, and lives with their mom. The mom is also obese. The author says they struggle with overeating because their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate. When they try to talk to their mom about the portions and the chocolate, the mom responds with \"Well you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that this makes it harder for them to control their eating and have asked the mom to help, but the mom blames them instead. The author is considering moving out in 4 years to lose weight and is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions or intentions are at fault. The author is trying to communicate their needs and express that the mom's behavior is contributing to their obesity. They\u2019re not taking responsibility for their own choices, but they're also not making the situation easier. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, the author does mention that they have a hard time holding back, so they're not entirely to blame for overeating. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. The author is trying to get support from their mom, but the mom isn't helping. The author's actions here are about seeking help, not actively doing something wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe the author is being overly critical of their mom without considering her perspective. The mom might have her own struggles with weight, and the portions might be a family norm. The author could be placing undue blame on the mom rather than taking personal responsibility. But the author is also in a vulnerable position, trying to manage their health and needing support.\n\nThe key points are the author's honest communication and the mom's unhelpful responses. The author isn't doing anything wrong by expressing their needs. The mom's behavior is the issue here. The author is seeking help, not causing the problem. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
