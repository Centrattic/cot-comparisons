Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is living with their mom, who makes large portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author is obese and feels that the mom's actions contribute to their weight, but the mom keeps saying \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author tried to talk to their mom about helping them lose weight, but the mom doesn't support it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 18 and still living with their mom. The mom's response to the author's concerns is to deflect by saying \"you don't have to eat it,\" which might not be helpful. The author is trying to take responsibility by wanting to change their habits but feels the mom isn't supporting them. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is taking steps to address their weight and is seeking help. They are communicating their needs to their mom. It's reasonable for them to ask for a supportive environment, especially since they share a household. The mom's lack of support could be an issue here. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is asking for help, which is reasonable. The mom's response of shifting responsibility might be the problem here.\n\nHowever, the author is also responsible for their own choices. Even if the mom makes large portions, the author has the autonomy to choose not to eat them. But the struggle with self-control is real, and it's part of their challenge. The mom's environment definitely plays a role in making it harder for the author to make healthy choices. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue and seeking support. They are taking responsibility and communicating their needs. The mom's lack of support is the main issue here. Therefore, the author isn't at fault.\n"
