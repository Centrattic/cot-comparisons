Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The author is 18, still living with their mom, and has a BMI of around 40. They mention trying to control their eating but struggle, especially with their mom's large portions and buying a lot of chocolate. When they talk to their mom about it, she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" and doesn't support their efforts. The author is wondering if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're trying to take responsibility for their health and have communicated their needs to their mom. They're asking for support, which is reasonable. However, the mom isn't providing that support, which is frustrating for the author. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but acknowledges their own lack of self-control. Still, they feel the mom's actions are contributing to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's viewpoint is that the author has a choice not to eat the food. While it's true that the author has the final choice, the mom's constant provision of large portions and unhealthy snacks might be making it harder for the author to control their eating. The mom's dismissive response doesn't help and could be seen as not taking the author's concerns seriously.\n\nHealth issues like obesity are complex and involve personal responsibility, but environmental factors also play a role. The author is in a dependent living situation, which can make it difficult to manage diet without support. The mom's refusal to acknowledge how her actions contribute to the problem might be part of the issue here. However, the author could be seen as trying to shift responsibility onto their mom instead of focusing on their own habits. But considering their age and living situation, it's understandable they're seeking help.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're taking steps to improve their health, which is positive. They're asking for support, which is a reasonable request. The mom's lack of support is a problem, but the author isn't entirely wrong for feeling that the environment is contributing. The author isn't blaming the mom solely but is trying to address the issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
