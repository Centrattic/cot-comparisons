Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The story is about the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mother. The mother also has weight issues and makes large portions, buying a lot of chocolate. The author tries to tell her that this is contributing to their weight and asks for help, but the mother just says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels unsupported and is considering moving out to take control.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author wants to lose weight and recognizes that their eating habits are an issue. They've communicated their struggles to their mother and asked for her support, but the mother isn't helpful, just repeating the same advice that the author finds unhelpful. The mother's response seems dismissive and not addressing the actual problem. \n\nThe author isn't blaming the mother entirely but is acknowledging that the environment (big portions, availability of unhealthy food) is a factor. The mother's behavior is enabling the author's overeating because she's not making changes to support the author's goals. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the author is taking steps to address their own health, which is their right. They're not in control of their mother's actions, but they're seeking help. The mother's refusal to assist doesn't make the author wrong for wanting that help. The author isn't at fault for wanting to lose weight and trying to communicate their needs. The mother's response is the issue here, not the author's initial concern.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're seeking support and taking responsibility for their health, while the mother is not being supportive. The author's frustration is understandable given the lack of help from their mother.\n"
