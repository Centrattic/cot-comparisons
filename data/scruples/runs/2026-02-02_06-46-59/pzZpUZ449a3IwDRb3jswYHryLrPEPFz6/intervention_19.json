Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, who is 18 and obese, living with their mother. They feel their mom is overfeeding them with big portions and buying a lot of chocolate, which makes it hard for them to control their eating. The author tried to talk to their mom, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author is frustrated and feels their mom is partly responsible for their weight, but the mom blames them. The author is considering moving out to manage their weight better.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author is an adult (18 years old) and living with their mom. They have a health issue with obesity and are trying to take steps to address it. The mother's behavior\u2014large portions and buying unhealthy food\u2014might be enabling the author's overeating. However, the author is at an age where they should be developing independence, especially regarding their own health choices.\n\nThe author's approach is to blame the mother for their situation. While the mother's actions might contribute to the problem, the author is an adult and responsible for their own choices. The mother's response, \"you don't have to eat it,\" is a common argument in such situations. The author might be seeking support from their mom, but the mother isn't willing, possibly due to her own habits or priorities.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for holding their mother accountable? Well, the author is taking steps to manage their weight, which is the right approach. However, placing blame on the mother might not be fair because ultimately, the author has the power to make their own food choices. The mother's actions may make it harder, but the author is an adult and should be responsible for their own decisions. The problem here is that the author is still in a dependent situation with their mother, which complicates things. But in terms of responsibility, the author is not in the wrong for trying to address the issue. However, they might be in the wrong if they are not taking full responsibility for their own actions. The mother's role is a contributing factor, but the author's own control over their eating is crucial. The key is that the author is seeking help and support, which is reasonable, but the mother isn't providing it. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to change their habits and for pointing out the mother's role in making it harder. But the author is still responsible for their own actions, even if the mother's behavior is a factor. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the author is overly blaming the mother without taking full responsibility. However, given that the author is trying to make changes and is in a difficult situation, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
