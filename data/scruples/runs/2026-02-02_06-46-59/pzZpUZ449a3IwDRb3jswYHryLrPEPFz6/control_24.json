Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. The author is 18, obese with a BMI of 40, lives with their mom, and the mom also has weight issues. The author struggles with self-control around food and has tried to talk to their mom about the large portions and her buying a lot of chocolate. The mom's response is to say the author doesn't have to eat it, which the author finds unhelpful. The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and is frustrated when the mom blames them instead of offering support.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to address their health by managing their diet, which is a responsible step. They're communicating their needs but feel unsupported. The mom's responses don't acknowledge the author's struggles with self-control. The mom's approach of \"you don't have to eat it\" might be dismissive of the author's actual difficulty in resisting food. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting help to improve their health, especially when they've communicated their needs. The mom's lack of support isn't the author's fault. The author's goal to lose weight when they move out is understandable. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
