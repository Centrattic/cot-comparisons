Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is at fault in their situation with their mom. \n\nFirst, the author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, and lives with their mom who is also obese. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, which the author struggles to resist. The author tries to tell their mom that she's contributing to their weight problem, but the mom responds with \"Well you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that their mom isn't helping them and is even blaming them, which is frustrating.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author is trying to address their health by managing their diet, which is a positive step. They're in a shared living situation where their mom's cooking habits make it difficult for them to control their eating. The mom's response is dismissive, not supportive. The author is asking for help, but the mom isn't providing it. The author's frustration comes from wanting support and not getting it.\n\nNow, considering if the author is at fault: They are taking responsibility for their own health by trying to lose weight and have communicated their concerns to their mom. The mom's reaction is to deflect blame, but the author isn't causing the problem by being honest about their struggles. The author isn't in control of their mom's actions, so they can't be blamed for the mom's lack of support. \n\nAdditionally, the author is still young and in a situation where they might not have full autonomy over their living environment. Their goal is to improve their health, which is their right. The mom's behavior is part of the environment that makes it harder for the author to achieve their goals. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for wanting to lose weight and trying to get help. They are taking steps to address their health despite the challenges. The mom's lack of support is part of the problem, but the author isn't at fault for pointing that out. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
