Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, living with their mom who also cooks a lot and has big portions. The author mentions they struggle with self-control and have told their mom this, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels their mom contributes to their weight issue and tried to discuss it but got blamed. Now, they're wondering if they're the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, but still living with their mom. The mom's response might be dismissive, not taking their concerns seriously. The author is trying to address their health, which is valid. However, is it fair to accuse the mom of being responsible? Well, the author does admit they can't resist eating the food, which is a personal struggle. But the mom's cooking habits and buying large portions could be enabling the issue.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, enabling can be a factor. If someone is trying to control their eating, constant access to large portions and unhealthy food makes it harder. The mom's \"you don't have to eat it\" response might be a way of denying responsibility, not helping the author. The author is seeking support, which the mom isn't providing, which is a valid need.\n\nHowever, the author is responsible for their own choices. Even if the environment is challenging, they have some agency. But given their self-control issues, the mom's role in creating an environment that's difficult for them is significant. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely, but pointing out that the environment isn't helping. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting the mom to help? Probably not. It's reasonable to ask for a supportive environment. The mom isn't doing that, so the author isn't at fault for pointing that out. The key here is the mom's lack of support versus the author's desire to change. The author is taking steps themselves, but the situation is hard. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
