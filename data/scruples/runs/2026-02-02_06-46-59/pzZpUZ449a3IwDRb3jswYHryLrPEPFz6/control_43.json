Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is 18, obese with a BMI around 40, and lives with their mother who is also obese. They mention that their mom makes huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, and when they tell her to stop, she says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that their mom is partly responsible for their weight and tried to bring it up, but she blamed them and said she's too old to lose weight. The author is now trying to handle it themselves and plans to move out in 4 years. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the author's responsibility for their own health and the mother's role in providing food. The author is an adult, 18 years old, which is the age of majority in many places. They acknowledge that they can't control their eating and have communicated that to their mother. The mother's response seems dismissive, not supporting the author's efforts. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight but feels unsupported.\n\nThe mother might have the right to cook and eat as she chooses, but when it affects her child's health, especially if the child is trying to manage their weight, the mother's actions could be seen as contributing. However, the author is also responsible for their own choices. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the mother accountable. The author isn't controlling the mother's actions but is expressing a need for support. The mother's refusal to help might be the issue here. The author is not shaming the mother but is seeking assistance. Since the author is an adult, they have the autonomy to make their own decisions, even if the environment is challenging. The mother's responsibility might be more about her own health, but the author is not in the wrong for wanting to improve theirs. So the answer is probably B, No.\n"
