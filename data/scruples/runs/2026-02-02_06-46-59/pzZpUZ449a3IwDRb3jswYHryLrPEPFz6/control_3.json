Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 18 and obese with a BMI around 40, is living with their mom who is also obese. The mom cooks huge portions and buys a lot of chocolate, even though the author has told her multiple times that they can't control themselves around the food. The author tried to talk to their mom calmly and explain that her actions are contributing to their weight, but the mom just blames them and says \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author is considering moving out to lose weight and wants to know if they're the asshole for thinking their mom is overfeeding them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is 18, so they're an adult, but still living with their mom. They have a health issue related to obesity and are struggling with self-control around food. The mom, who is also obese, is preparing large portions and buying a lot of chocolate. The author is asking the mom to change her behavior to help them, but the mom isn't supporting them and instead is dismissive.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and support. The author is not saying the mom is solely responsible, but that she's partly responsible by overfeeding them. The mom's response is to not take any responsibility and to tell the author to just not eat the food. The author is seeking help because they can't control themselves, which is a common issue with overeating and obesity. The mom, however, isn't offering that support, which could be harmful. \n\nFrom a health perspective, the author has a valid concern. If the environment is contributing to their overeating, it's reasonable to ask for adjustments. The mom's insistence that the author can just refuse to eat it ignores the author's struggle with self-control. It's not the author's fault that they have this difficulty. The mom's lack of support might be making it harder for them to make healthier choices. The author's plan to move out and manage their health independently seems like a reasonable step, especially since they can't get the support they need at home.\n\nHowever, I should consider if the author is being too hard on their mom. The mom might not realize how her actions are affecting the author. Or maybe the mom is also dealing with her own issues related to food and weight. But the author has communicated their need for help, and the mom hasn't provided it. In that case, the author isn't wrong for pointing out the mom's role in the situation. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't constructive. \n\nSo, in the context of the question, the author is not in the wrong. They're seeking support for a health issue and their mom isn't cooperating. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
