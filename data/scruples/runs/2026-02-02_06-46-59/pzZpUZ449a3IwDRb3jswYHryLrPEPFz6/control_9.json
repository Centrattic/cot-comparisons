Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeling that their mom is overfeeding them, contributing to their obesity. The author is 18, lives with their mother, and has tried to talk to her about portion sizes and unhealthy foods like chocolate. The mom's response is \"you don't have to eat it,\" but the author can't resist. The author feels the mom is partly responsible and is seeking advice on whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The author is trying to address their weight issue and has communicated their concerns to their mom. The mom's response is dismissive, not providing support. The author is trying to take steps to lose weight, which is their own responsibility, but the environment (mom's cooking and buying unhealthy food) is making it harder. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling that their mom's actions contribute to their weight. The author isn't blaming the mom solely but is seeking her help. The mom isn't cooperating, so the author is trying to take matters into their own hands. \n\nLegally and ethically, while the author's weight is primarily their own responsibility, the mom's lack of support could be seen as not helping a family member in need. However, the author isn't forcing the mom to do anything; they're just expressing their needs and trying to manage their own health. The author's intention is positive\u2014trying to improve their health. The mom's response is problematic because she's not supportive. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address their health and for pointing out the environmental factors that hinder their progress. The real issue is the mom's lack of support, but the question is about the author's fault. The author is trying to be responsible, so they aren't in the wrong.\n"
