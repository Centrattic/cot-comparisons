Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation where they feel their mom is overfeeding them, leading to obesity.\n\nFirst, the author is 18 and still living with their mother. They mention being obese with a BMI around 40. They've tried to address the issue by talking to their mom about the large portions and the availability of unhealthy foods like chocolate. The mother's response is to tell the author not to eat it, but the author struggles with self-control. The mother doesn't seem to support the author's efforts to lose weight and instead blames them, saying it's their choice not to eat the food. The author is conflicted and feels unsupported, planning to move out in four years to tackle the issue then.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's intention is to seek help from their mother, which is a common approach when dealing with health issues, especially when living together. The mother's response is dismissive and doesn't offer support, which can be frustrating. However, the author is an adult (18 years old), so they should have autonomy over their own food choices. But still, asking for support from a family member isn't unreasonable, especially when the environment is contributing to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might not be the most effective. Telling the mother that she's partly responsible could come off as accusatory, which might lead to defensiveness. The mother might feel criticized, leading her to deflect blame instead of offering support. The author's strategy of trying to get the mother to reduce portions and not buy unhealthy food is valid, but the communication might not be the best approach. The author could have tried setting their own boundaries or using \"I\" statements to express their needs without blaming.\n\nHowever, considering the mother's own health and the fact that she may not be in the best position to support weight loss (both emotionally and perhaps physically), the situation is complex. The author's struggle with self-control is a personal challenge, but the environment definitely plays a role. The mother's lack of support is a problem, but the author's age and autonomy mean they should take some responsibility for their actions. However, the core issue is the mother's environment contributing to the problem, and the author is asking for help, which is not unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking help. It's a common and reasonable approach. The mother's lack of support is her own issue. The author's frustration is valid. The key point is that the author is an adult trying to manage their own health, and while the mother's habits are contributing, the author's request for assistance isn't wrong. The author's communication style might be improved, but that doesn't make them in the wrong overall.\n"
