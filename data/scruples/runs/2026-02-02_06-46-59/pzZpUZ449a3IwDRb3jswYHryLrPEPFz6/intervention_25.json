Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong. The author is 18, lives with their mom, is obese, and feels that the mom's overfeeding is contributing to their weight. They tried to talk to the mom, who responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which the author finds unhelpful.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that they can't control their eating when there's a lot of food or tempting items like chocolate. The mom makes big portions and buys large quantities of sweets, which the author can't resist. The author is trying to lose weight and has asked the mom for help, but the mom is resistant and shifts responsibility back to the author.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong to feel this way. The author is taking responsibility for their own health by wanting to lose weight and has communicated their needs. The mom's response doesn't support the author's goals and may be enabling the behavior by providing excessive food. The author isn't blaming the mom entirely but is expressing a need for support, which the mom isn't providing.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author has control over their own eating habits, the environment created by the mom might be making it harder. However, the author is an adult (18) and could be expected to take more personal responsibility. But the mom might not be aware that her actions are contributing to the problem. The author's frustration is understandable, but they might also need to find ways to manage their environment independently, like portion control or self-regulation strategies.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They aren't necessarily at fault for wanting to lose weight or pointing out environmental factors. However, maybe they're placing too much responsibility on their mom when ultimately, they have autonomy over their choices. The mom isn't forcing them to eat, so the author's ability to control their eating is their own responsibility. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not taking full responsibility for their actions despite the mom's role in the environment.\n"
