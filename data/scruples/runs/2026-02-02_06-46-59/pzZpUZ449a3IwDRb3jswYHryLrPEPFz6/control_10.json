Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being obese and living with their mother, who they believe is overfeeding them. The mother makes large portions and buys a lot of unhealthy food, like chocolate. The author has tried to talk to their mom about it, but she responds with \"you don't have to eat it,\" which isn't helpful because the author struggles with self-control.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking their mom's actions contribute to their weight. They mentioned they have a BMI around 40, which is in the obese range. They want to lose weight and feel like their mom's habits make it harder.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me think. The author is trying to address a health issue and has communicated their needs to their mother. The mother isn't supportive, so the author is seeking validation. The author isn't attacking their mom but is asking for help. The mother's response is dismissive. The author's intention is self-improvement, which is positive. They\u2019re not blaming their mom entirely but are acknowledging their own responsibility to some extent. However, they also recognize that external factors (like the mother's cooking habits) affect their ability to manage their diet. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to take steps to improve their health, which is their own choice. The mother's actions might not be malicious, but they do create an environment that's challenging for the author. The author isn't wrong to want to address that. They\u2019re not in the wrong for feeling overwhelmed by the situation and seeking support. Their actions are about personal health, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe mother's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" is a common defense, but it doesn't consider the author's struggle with self-control. The author is asking for cooperation, which is reasonable. The mother's age argument might also be a way to avoid responsibility, but the author isn't attacking her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to manage their health in a difficult situation and have communicated their needs, even though the mother isn't responding constructively. The answer should be B (No).\n"
