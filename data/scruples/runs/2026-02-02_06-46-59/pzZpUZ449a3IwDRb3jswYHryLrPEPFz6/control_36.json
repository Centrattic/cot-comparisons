Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're at fault for thinking their mom is overfeeding them. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they're obese with a BMI around 40, which is in the morbidly obese range. They live with their mom who cooks big portions and buys a lot of chocolate. The author has told her they struggle to control their eating, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels the mom is partly responsible for their weight and has tried to get her help, but she blames them and refuses to take action.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for thinking this. To determine that, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mom is making it harder for them to manage their weight by providing high portions and unhealthy snacks. The author is trying to communicate their struggles but isn't getting support. \n\nIs the author wrong to feel this way? Probably not. It's reasonable to feel frustrated if someone you live with contributes to your health issues, especially when you've communicated your needs. The mom's response of \"you don't have to eat it\" doesn't acknowledge the author's lack of self-control, which they've admitted. However, the author's approach of blaming the mom might not be the healthiest, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. \n\nThe key points are that the author is trying to address their weight and has communicated the problem. The mom isn't helping, but the author isn't the one overeating against their will. They have a hard time resisting, which the mom doesn't seem to support. So, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. The answer should be B.\n"
