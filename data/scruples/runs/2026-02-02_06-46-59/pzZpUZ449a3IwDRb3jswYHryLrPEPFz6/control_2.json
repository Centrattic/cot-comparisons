Am from europe :)\n\nI am obese, I think I have a BMI around \\~40? which is waaaaaay too much. I am glad that I am still able to do whatever I need to do, like walking without much problems, running (with little stamina ofc, but no pain or anything) etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always wanted to do something against that, and of course, the best place to start is food.\n\nSomething you probably guessed is, I still live with my mother (Im 18yo btw), and she does most of the cooking.\n\nMy mother is obese too, I dont know how much, but... well you can clearly see that.\n\nI must admit, I have problems holding back, if there is something to eat, Ill eat it, which is something I have told her many times over.\n\nShe always makes these HUGE portions, and when I tell her, that she should stop making so much, I get the\n\n\"Well you dont have to eat it\".\n\nOr when she buys herself chockolate, like these packs with like 30 or so pieces of chocolate, I again tell her, to stop buying this, and again she tells me:'  \n**\"Well you dont have to eat it\".**\n\nLike I said, I cant help myself. as much as I try, I always break.\n\nNow to the actual AITA:\n\nI tried talking to her, telling her, as kindly and calm as I can, that she probably partly responsible for my weight.\n\nWhat did she do? Blame me for everything. I tell her, that I need a bit of help from her, because I cant hold it, and she again, tells  me that I dont have to eat it! I KNOW, but it would make it 1000 times easier if you  too, would help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ask her, if we should consider to both loose some weight I get told, that she is X Years old, and It wouldnt matter for her.\n\nI just stopped arguing. I now do what I can myself, try to do it every little bit. I have told myself, that I will loose weight, once I move out, which will probably take only like 4 years max.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA? Because I genuenly dont know at this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 18 years old and lives with their mom. They're obese with a BMI around 40, which is severely high. They recognize the problem and want to address it, starting with diet. The main issue is that their mom keeps making huge portions and buying a lot of chocolate, like packs with 30 pieces. The author tells her about the portions and the chocolate, but the mom responds with \"you don't have to eat it.\" The author feels that this is making it harder for them because they struggle to resist. They tried talking to her about it kindly but she blames them and refuses to help. The author is frustrated and plans to move out to take control of their diet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is at fault. The author is trying to manage their weight, which is a health issue. They're not forcing their mom to do anything; they're asking for support. The mom's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. The author isn't in control of the food environment at home, which is a valid concern. It's reasonable to ask for help when struggling with self-control, especially when dealing with obesity. The mom's age isn't a valid excuse for not supporting her child's health goals. The author is taking steps on their own, but the mom isn't cooperating. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling that way? They're not demanding food; they're expressing a problem and seeking support. The mom's actions (big portions, buying lots of chocolate) are part of the environment contributing to the author's struggle. The author isn't to blame for their mom's behavior. They're trying to address the issue respectfully. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is taking responsibility for their health and is in a difficult situation where they need support, which the mom isn't providing. The mom's responses are unhelpful, and the author isn't at fault for seeking assistance. They're not in the wrong for pointing out how the mom's actions may be affecting their health.\n"
