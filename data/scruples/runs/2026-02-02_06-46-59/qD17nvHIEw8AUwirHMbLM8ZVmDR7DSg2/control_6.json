We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation step by step. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia who is taking their food, and the author confronting them about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The roommate has bulimia, which is a serious eating disorder. The author is on a budget and cooks a lot, while the roommate isn't cooking and is taking their food, even replacing it with different products. When confronted, the roommate breaks down and explains their condition. The author responds by saying it's not their problem and tells the roommate to buy their own food, since their parents support them. The author feels that the roommate should control themselves, even though they have an illness.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The roommate has a mental health issue that's causing them to act in a way they know is wrong. They are on a waitlist for treatment, so they might be struggling. The author, on the other hand, is paying for the food they cook, and it's their property. They have a right to be upset about someone taking their belongings without permission.\n\nBut the author's response is where things get tricky. Confronting someone about taking their food is reasonable, but the way they handled it might be harsh. The author didn't ask the roommate to stop taking food; they just expressed frustration and told them to buy their own. However, the author didn't offer support or understanding, which might be important given the mental health aspect. \n\nThe roommate is in a vulnerable state, and the author's public confrontation led to the roommate crying and avoiding interaction. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their right to their property, but their approach could be seen as insensitive. They didn't consider the roommate's mental health struggles in their response. For example, suggesting that the roommate can't control themselves at the grocery store might be a bit of a straw man argument, as that's a different context with different social norms.\n\nHowever, the author also has a right to feel violated when their belongings are taken without permission. It's a balance between personal boundaries and compassion. The key question is whether demanding control over their own property is unreasonable, especially when the roommate's actions are harmful to themselves. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, taking someone else's property without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of mental health. But when mental health is a factor, the expectation of self-control might be different. The author might not be the asshole for standing up for their own rights, but they could have handled it more empathetically. The roommate might need help, but the author isn't necessarily obligated to provide it. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to their property and the right to set boundaries. However, there's a nuance in how they handled it. But the core issue is about the ownership of the food and the expectation of respect for personal property. The author's reaction, while perhaps harsh, isn't entirely unreasonable given the situation.\n"
