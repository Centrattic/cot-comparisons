We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a roommate who is bulimic and taking the author's food without permission. The author confronts her, and the roommate is upset. The question is whether the author was wrong to ask her to control herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of shared living. Roommates often share common spaces but also have personal items. Food stored in a roommate's own fridge or cupboards might be considered their personal property. The author is cooking a lot, which is understandable since they're on a budget, and the roommate is taking that food without permission. Even if the roommate is replacing the items, the act of taking them without asking is an issue. \n\nThe roommate has a mental health condition, bulimia, which affects her behavior. The author is frustrated because they don't see why the roommate can't control herself, especially in a situation where they wouldn't take someone else's property. But the roommate is in a vulnerable state, struggling with an eating disorder. The author's reaction is about personal boundaries and ownership, while the roommate's actions stem from a health issue. \n\nThe author confronted the roommate, who then broke down crying. The author's response was firm, pointing out that the roommate can control herself elsewhere, so why not here. The key here is whether the author's approach was reasonable. On one hand, the author has a right to their belongings and to set boundaries. On the other hand, the roommate is in a difficult situation with a disorder. The author's tone might have been harsh, but they did acknowledge the problem and tried to address it. \n\nThe roommate's responsibility to control her impulses versus the author's right to their food. Even with a disorder, there's a societal expectation to respect others' property. However, the author might not be considering the roommate's struggle. But the roommate isn't seeking help yet, just on a waitlist. The author isn't directly causing harm but is enforcing their boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't yell or threaten, just expressed frustration and set boundaries. They did try to be understanding initially but felt justified in their stance. The roommate's actions are wrong regardless of her condition, so the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
