We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 20-year-old who's sharing an apartment with another 20-year-old. The roommate has bulimia and has been taking the user's food, replacing it with different products. The user confronted her, which led to the roommate crying and explaining her condition. The user's response was to tell her to buy her own food since her parents support her, and that it's not acceptable to take others' property regardless of the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can affect self-control. The roommate might be struggling with impulses and could be in a state where they can't resist taking food despite knowing it's wrong. The user's initial assumption was that the roommate couldn't control herself, which is a common issue in eating disorders. \n\nBut the user is also on a tight budget and cooks from scratch, which is a legitimate concern. They have a right to privacy and control over their belongings. The roommate's actions are indeed taking the user's property without consent, which is a violation of boundaries. However, the user's response was to confront her harshly, maybe not with enough empathy. The user didn't offer support or understanding, just told her to buy her own food. This could have been a triggering or hurtful reaction, especially given the roommate's mental health issues.\n\nThe user argues that it's not unreasonable to expect self-control, comparing it to not eating someone's cookies at home. But the difference here is that the roommate is dealing with a compulsion due to a disorder. It's like someone with an addiction taking something they shouldn't. The user might not be at fault for the initial confrontation, but the manner in which they handled it\u2014without compassion\u2014could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but hasn't received it yet. The user's suggestion to buy her own food might not be realistic if she's struggling financially, even if her parents support her. Maybe she can't afford to buy her own, or the disorder makes her take without considering the cost.\n\nThe user's budget situation is valid, but there's a balance between being understanding of a mental health crisis and setting boundaries. The user has the right to be upset about their belongings being taken, but the way they expressed it\u2014without offering support or a solution\u2014might have made the situation worse. They could have suggested temporary solutions like keeping their food in a shared area with a lock, or discussing it with her to find a way she can manage her urges without taking from them, while she waits for treatment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user isn't the one with the disorder, so they're not at fault for having a problem with someone taking their food. But the way they handled the confrontation and their lack of immediate support might be seen as insensitive. The key here is whether the user's actions were reasonable given the roommate's condition. They did set a boundary, which is important, but the delivery could have been more compassionate. \n\nSo, while the user isn't entirely wrong for being upset and setting boundaries, their approach might have contributed to the tension. However, the roommate's actions are clearly inappropriate regardless of her condition. The answer might hinge on whether it's the user's responsibility to accommodate someone's disorder to the point of not confronting them. But in general, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting their own food respected and for expressing that, even if their method could be improved. The roommate's actions are the main issue here. So the answer would be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
