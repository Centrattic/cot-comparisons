We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. The situation is that the roommate is taking the author's food, which is causing tension. The author confronted the roommate, who admitted to being bulimic and taking the food, but the author still insists on her controlling herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're cooking a lot and can't afford to eat out, so their food is important to them. They noticed the roommate taking food and replacing it with different products. When confronted, the roommate explained her bulimia, but the author still felt justified in asking her to stop, even suggesting she buy her own food since her parents support her. The author feels it's not unreasonable to expect self-control, similar to not taking food from a store or restaurant.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health condition that's affecting her behavior. Bulimia is a serious disorder that can impair a person's ability to control their impulses. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but hasn't received it yet. The author's response, while direct, might come across as dismissive of the roommate's struggles, even if they acknowledge the issue exists.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between personal boundaries and empathy for a roommate's mental health. The author is within their rights to expect respect for their property. However, the way they approached the situation might not have considered the roommate's condition adequately. The author's frustration is valid, but responding with a \"you should control yourself\" approach without offering support or understanding could exacerbate the roommate's issues. \n\nBulimia is not a choice; it's a disorder that requires treatment. The author might not fully grasp the depth of the roommate's struggle, leading to a harsh response. The roommate's reaction of crying and the subsequent silence suggest that the confrontation was emotionally damaging. The author's insistence on the roommate buying her own food, given that her parents support her, might also ignore the financial pressures the roommate might face, even if her parents provide support.\n\nIn terms of social norms, taking someone's food without permission is indeed wrong, but the context here is a mental health crisis. The author's approach lacked empathy and understanding, which could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment for someone in need. While the author isn't entirely in the wrong for setting boundaries, the way they enforced those boundaries might have been inappropriate, especially given the roommate's condition.\n\nSo, the author's actions, although coming from a place of personal right to their belongings, may have disregarded the roommate's mental health needs. This could mean the author is partially in the wrong because they didn't provide the necessary support or understanding, even if their initial stance on boundaries is understandable.\n"
