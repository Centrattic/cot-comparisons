We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. The roommate has a mental health issue and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author cooked this out, confronted her, and the roommate was upset. The author feels justified because they think the roommate should control herself, especially since she can buy her own food.\n\nFirst, the roommate's health is a factor. Bulimia is a serious disorder, and the author's approach might be too harsh. The roommate is already struggling and in a vulnerable state. Confronting her in a way that made her cry and avoid interaction could be seen as insensitive. The author might not have considered the emotional impact or offered support, like suggesting resources or checking in on her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their property and privacy. The roommate taking food without permission is a breach of trust. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they're on a budget and cooking for themselves. However, the way the confrontation was handled could have been more empathetic. Maybe the author could have set boundaries while showing understanding of the roommate's situation.\n\nThe key points here are the mental health aspect and how the author communicated their concerns. While the roommate's actions are problematic, the author's response might have been too confrontational without considering her mental health. The author could have approached the situation with more compassion, perhaps discussing solutions together, like the roommate buying her own food or both setting up separate storage. The author's statement about not wanting to \"enable\" the behavior by being too lenient is valid, but the delivery was harsh, leading to emotional distress. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't entirely wrong for standing up for their rights, but the method and tone might have been too harsh given the roommate's circumstances. The roommate's health issues should be considered, and the author could have handled the confrontation more sensitively. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the lack of empathy and support in their approach.\n"
