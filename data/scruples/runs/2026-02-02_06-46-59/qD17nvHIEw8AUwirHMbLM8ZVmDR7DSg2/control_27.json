We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their roommate about taking food. The roommate has bulimia and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author found out their roommate was taking their food, tried to confront her, and now they're not speaking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder, and the roommate is struggling with it. She mentioned she knows it's wrong but can't control herself. She replaces the food but the author is still upset. The author feels the roommate should control herself, comparing it to not taking food from a store or restaurant.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is paying for the food and is on a budget. They cook a lot, so maybe the roommate isn't getting enough food otherwise. The author might feel their property is being taken without permission. But the roommate's situation is a health issue, not just laziness or selfishness. \n\nThe author's approach might have been harsh. Confronting someone with a mental health problem directly might not be the best approach. Maybe the author could have tried to support the roommate or suggest seeking help earlier. However, the author also has a right to their belongings and might not want to be part of the roommate's problem without consent.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The roommate's actions are harmful to her health and the author's property. The author is within their rights to ask for their food to not be taken. However, the way the confrontation was handled might not consider the roommate's mental health adequately. Maybe there's a balance between respecting property and supporting someone's health. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the roommate should control herself, which is a valid point because regardless of the reason, taking someone else's food without permission is theft. However, the roommate's inability to control herself is due to a disorder. The author's response might not be malicious, but not being considerate of the roommate's health issues could make them at fault. \n\nAlternatively, the roommate should have addressed the issue earlier or sought help. The author's frustration is understandable. It's a tough situation where both parties have valid points. But in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be wrong for setting boundaries, but could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer could be B (No) because the author is not wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe A (Yes) if they didn't consider the roommate's mental health enough. It's tricky. I think the key is that the roommate's actions are a health issue, and the author's response, while direct, might not be wrong, but could have been more empathetic. However, the author did apologize and is trying to be nice now. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their own food, but could have handled it differently. So the answer is B.\n"
