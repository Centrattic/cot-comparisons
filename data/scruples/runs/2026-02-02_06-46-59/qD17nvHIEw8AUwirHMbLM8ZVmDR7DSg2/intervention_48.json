We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia who's been taking the author's food, and the author confronted her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The roommate is dealing with a serious eating disorder, bulimia. The author cooks a lot of meals and has been noticing their food being taken and replaced with similar items. When confronted, the roommate admits to the issue and is upset, explaining her condition and waiting for treatment. The author then tells the roommate that she needs to control herself and that if she needs to eat, she should buy her own food.\n\nThe user's analysis is that the author might be wrong because the roommate is struggling with a mental health issue. But the user is curious if the author is justified in their actions.\n\nI should consider several factors here. First, the roommate's mental health: bulimia is a serious condition that can be difficult to manage, especially without treatment. The roommate is on a waitlist for help, which suggests she's seeking assistance but it's not immediate. Taking food isn't a good coping mechanism, but it's a symptom of her disorder.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also on a budget and cooking for themselves. The food is their personal property, and having it taken without permission is a violation. The author has a right to expect that their belongings aren't being taken. However, the way the author handled the confrontation might be problematic. They told the roommate that she can't control herself and that she should buy her own food, which could come off as harsh, especially given the roommate's mental health struggles.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to their property versus the roommate's mental health. The author's approach might have been too direct and not empathetic enough. They didn't offer support or suggest alternatives, like helping the roommate find resources or discussing solutions together. Instead, they blamed the roommate, which could exacerbate the roommate's feelings of shame and isolation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's true that taking others' food isn't acceptable, the context of a mental health issue complicates things. The author might not be in the wrong for standing up for their own property, but their handling of the situation could be seen as insensitive. The roommate's condition isn't an excuse for the behavior, but it's a factor that requires understanding and compassion.\n\nThe author's argument that they expect the same restraint as themselves might not account for the roommate's inability to control her impulses due to her disorder. It's possible that the author's expectations are reasonable in a general sense, but the roommate's specific circumstances mean that those expectations aren't feasible without support or treatment.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the right in terms of the action (reclaiming their property) but in the wrong in terms of the approach and empathy shown. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. The answer depends on balancing personal rights with compassion for mental health issues. The author's confrontation might be justified, but their lack of supportiveness could make them the asshole. But if the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, maybe the author should have suggested ways to help, like connecting her with local resources or suggesting temporary solutions like sharing groceries if they can afford it. The author's response was to tell her to buy her own food, which might not be feasible if her parents support her but she's not using that support. However, the author isn't responsible for the roommate's choices beyond their shared living situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a point about not wanting their food taken, the way they handled it without considering the roommate's mental health struggles might make them the asshole. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. Alternatively, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their own boundaries, especially if the roommate's actions are harmful regardless of her condition. It's a tough call, but leaning towards A because the author's response lacked empathy and support.\n"
