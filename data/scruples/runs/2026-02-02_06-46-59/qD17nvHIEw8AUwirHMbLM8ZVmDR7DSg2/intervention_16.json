We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food without permission. The author approached the roommate about it, and the roommate admitted to the problem but is on a waitlist for treatment. The author then told the roommate that they can just buy their own food since their parents support them, which made the roommate upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health issue. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can be difficult to control. The roommate is aware of the problem but can't help it right now. The author is upset because their food is being taken without consent, which is understandable. Property rights are a thing\u2014people expect their belongings, including food, to be respected.\n\nThe author confronted the roommate, which is a reasonable step when someone's boundaries are being crossed. The roommate expressed remorse and explained their situation. The author's response was to tell them to buy their own food, which might come off as harsh. But considering the roommate's financial situation (since the author mentions they support themselves on a budget and the roommate's parents support them), maybe the author is trying to find a solution. However, the author's frustration is valid because it's not their responsibility to provide food for someone else, especially without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the confrontation more sensitively. Telling someone to \"just buy their own food\" might not take into account the roommate's mental health struggles. Maybe offering to help them find resources or support would have been better. But the author's main point was that they don't want someone else eating their food, which is their right. They\u2019re not being unreasonable in expecting someone to respect their property.\n\nThe roommate's behavior is unacceptable regardless of their mental health. Taking someone else's food without permission is stealing, even if it's driven by an illness. The author is within their rights to ask for that to stop. However, the way they handled the confrontation might have been a bit abrupt, but given the circumstances, it's hard to say if that makes them the asshole. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is important for their own well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their belongings and to ask that their roommate respects them. The roommate's actions are the issue here, not the author's response. The author is justified in their frustration and in setting those boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
