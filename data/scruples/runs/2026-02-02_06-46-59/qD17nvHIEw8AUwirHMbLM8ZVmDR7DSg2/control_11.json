We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia taking food without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is sharing a living space and cooking for themselves due to a budget. The roommate is taking food, which is clearly making the author uncomfortable. The roommate explains it's due to bulimia and is on a waitlist for treatment. \n\nThe author confronted the roommate, who was emotional and apologized. The author then told them they could buy their own food. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author owns the food they cook, and even if the roommate is struggling with a mental health issue, taking without permission is a violation of personal property. \n\nHowever, the roommate has a mental health condition that's affecting their behavior. They might not have full control over their actions. The author is asking for self-control, but that's a common struggle in eating disorders. The author might be seen as understanding the situation but still being firm about their boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's response could be seen as harsh. Confronting someone who's already in emotional distress and cutting off communication might not be the best approach. But the author's stance is about respecting personal space and property, which is valid. \n\nIt's a tricky balance between empathy and personal boundaries. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, as everyone has the right to their possessions. The roommate's issue is serious, but the author can't be expected to enable the behavior. The question is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nConsidering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. They addressed the issue directly, acknowledged the roommate's problem, and set clear boundaries. While the approach might have been abrupt, the underlying issue of respecting shared living spaces is important. So the answer is B.\n"
