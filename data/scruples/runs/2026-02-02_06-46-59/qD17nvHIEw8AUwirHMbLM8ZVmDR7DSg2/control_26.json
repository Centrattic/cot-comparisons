We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking food.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The roommate has a bulimic disorder and has been taking the author's food despite replacing it. The author confronts her, leading to the roommate crying. The author is frustrated because they cook on a budget and want the roommate to control herself.\n\nNow, considering the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can be hard to manage without treatment. The roommate mentioned she's on a waitlist for treatment, so she might not have access to professional help right now. Her actions, while wrong, are influenced by her condition.\n\nThe author's perspective is about personal property and boundaries. They feel entitled to their food and are upset that someone else is taking it. However, the roommate is in a vulnerable state and might not have the control to resist the urge to binge. The author's response was direct and perhaps harsh, but they tried to communicate the issue.\n\nIs the author wrong? On one hand, they're standing up for their own stuff, which is valid. On the other hand, maybe they could have handled it with more empathy, considering the roommate's mental health. But the roommate's behavior is still not acceptable regardless of her condition. The author isn't obligated to tolerate someone else's property violations, even if the person is struggling.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on balancing empathy with personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries, even if the roommate is unwell. The roommate needs to seek help, and the author's responsibility isn't to enable harmful behavior.\n"
