We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The roommate has a bulimic disorder and is taking the author's food, trying to replace it with similar items. The author confronted her, and the roommate broke down crying. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to ask her to control herself.\n\nThe key points here are understanding the roommate's mental health issue and the author's right to their property. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can lead to loss of control over eating behaviors. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but it's not immediate. \n\nThe author is cooking a lot and on a budget, so the food is important to them. The roommate's actions are causing conflict. The author's response was to confront her, which led to emotional distress for the roommate. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author's action was wrong. On one hand, the author has a right to their property and to feel respected. It's reasonable to expect roommates to respect each other's belongings. On the other hand, the roommate has a mental health issue that impairs her self-control, and the author's confrontation might have been harsh given her vulnerable state.\n\nThe author's argument is that the roommate should control herself, comparing it to not taking food from stores or restaurants. However, the roommate is in a different context\u2014her living situation is private, and her disorder might make it hard to resist. The author is also considering that the roommate is supported by her parents, implying she can afford her own food. \n\nBut is it fair to expect someone with a mental illness to control their impulses when they're seeking treatment? The author's approach might lack empathy, but the roommate's actions are still a violation of boundaries. The author is entitled to feel upset about their property being taken. \n\nIn situations involving mental health, it's important to balance personal boundaries with compassion. The author might not be in the wrong for asserting their boundaries, but the way they expressed it could have been more supportive. However, the roommate's actions are still a problem regardless of her condition. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to their food and the roommate's actions are a violation of trust. The author's response, while perhaps abrupt, is a reaction to an ongoing issue that needed addressing. The roommate's condition is a factor, but the author is not obligated to tolerate the behavior indefinitely. They are within their rights to ask for respect.\n"
