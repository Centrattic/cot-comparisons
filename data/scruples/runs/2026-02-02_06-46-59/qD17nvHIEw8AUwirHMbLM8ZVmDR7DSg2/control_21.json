We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with different products. The author confronts her, she breaks down, explains her condition, and the author responds by saying they don't want her to take their food and that she can buy her own since her parents support her. The author feels justified because they're both adults and expects self-control.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the roommate's mental health condition (bulimia) and the author's reaction. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder, and people with it often have issues with control over their eating habits. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but can't get immediate assistance.\n\nThe author is upset about their food being taken without permission, even if it's replaced. They compare it to someone taking food from a grocery store or another person's table, which is obviously wrong. But the context here is different because the roommate has a mental health issue. The author is asking her to control herself, which might be something she struggles with due to her condition.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the roommate's condition might make it harder for her to control her impulses. The author is asking for self-control, which is reasonable in a general sense, but given the roommate's situation, maybe the author isn't considering the severity of the problem. However, the author is also within their rights to be upset about their belongings being taken without permission. Food is a basic necessity, and even if replaced, the act of taking it without consent is a boundary issue. The roommate's actions are a result of her illness, but the author is also in a shared living space and has the right to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response might have been harsh. Confronting her in a way that made her cry and then not speaking to her might not be the most empathetic approach. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether their response was perfectly empathetic. The author's main point is that they don't want their food taken, which is a valid concern. The roommate's condition doesn't excuse the behavior, but it does explain it. The author is asking for control, which is reasonable, but the roommate's inability to control herself is due to her illness.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, maybe they could have handled it with more empathy. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it perfectly. The roommate's condition is a factor, but the author is allowed to expect her to seek help and not take their food. Since the roommate is replacing the food, but the act of taking it without permission is still an issue, the author's stance seems justified. So the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
