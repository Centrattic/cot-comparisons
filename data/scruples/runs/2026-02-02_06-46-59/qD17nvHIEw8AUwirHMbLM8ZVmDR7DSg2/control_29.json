We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see.\n\nThe situation is about a roommate who has bulimia and is taking the narrator's food. The narrator is upset because they cook a lot on a budget and the roommate is taking their food, replacing it sometimes with different products. The roommate explained she's bulimic and can't control herself, but the narrator is telling her to control herself and to buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue. Bulimia is a serious disorder where someone might lose control and binge eat. If she's on a waitlist for treatment, it means she's trying to get help but hasn't received it yet. So she might be in a vulnerable state. \n\nThe narrator confronted her, and she was upset. The narrator is now wondering if they were wrong to ask her to control herself. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it fair to expect someone with a mental health condition to control their impulses? The narrator is asking her to not take food, but if she's struggling with an eating disorder, that might be a real challenge. On the other hand, the narrator owns the food and is paying for it. It's their property. \n\nThe narrator's argument is that it's not acceptable to take others' property regardless of mental health. But maybe they could have approached it differently. Instead of being harsh, perhaps suggesting solutions like buying her own food, or setting up a system where the food is more separated. \n\nThe roommate did apologize and is trying to replace the food, but the narrator is still upset. The narrator is also pointing out that she replaces it but still, it's her food being taken. \n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility. The narrator has the right to their property and the roommate has a disorder. The narrator's approach might have been a bit abrupt, but the issue of taking someone's food without permission is a valid concern. \n\nSo, is the narrator in the wrong? Well, they were justified in being upset about their property being taken. However, the way they confronted the roommate might have been harsh, especially without considering the roommate's mental health struggles. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for asking the roommate to control herself. \n\nSince the narrator is asking for the roommate to respect their property, which is a reasonable expectation, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the approach could have been more empathetic. But in terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether the action (asking the roommate to control herself) is unjust. \n\nThe roommate's actions are harmful, but they are due to a disorder. The narrator is holding her accountable, which they can do, as it's their home. However, the narrator could also be considering accommodations, like maybe the roommate helping with groceries or setting boundaries together. \n\nIn the end, the narrator isn't in the wrong for holding her accountable for taking their food. The roommate is the one who's taking without consent. The narrator's frustration is valid. So the answer is B, the narrator is not in the wrong.\n"
