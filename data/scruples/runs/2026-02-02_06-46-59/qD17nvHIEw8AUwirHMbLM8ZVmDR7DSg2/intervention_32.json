We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. The roommate has a mental health condition and is on a waitlist for treatment, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's situation. Bulimia is a serious disorder that can affect control over eating habits. The roommate might not have the same willpower to avoid the author's food as the author does in their own home. The author is on a budget and cooks for themselves, so the food is a significant investment. However, the roommate is replacing the food, which shows some effort to make amends, but the act of taking without asking is still a boundary issue.\n\nThe author confronted the roommate, leading to an emotional breakdown. While the author's frustration is understandable, the way they handled it might have been harsh. The roommate is already struggling, and the author's response could have been more empathetic. Instead of just telling the roommate to buy her own food, maybe they could have found a middle ground, like setting up a shared space with a separate section for each person's food or discussing the issue more compassionately.\n\nThe author's argument that it's not socially acceptable to take others' property is valid, but mental health issues can affect judgment. The roommate isn't intentionally being malicious; she's dealing with an illness. The author's responsibility to their own mental health is important too, so they have a right to set boundaries. However, the approach taken might have been too confrontational without considering the roommate's vulnerability.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have the right to protect their belongings. But the way they addressed the issue could have been more understanding, given the roommate's condition. The roommate's parents supporting her might mean she's not in financial trouble, but that doesn't negate the emotional impact on the author.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but their handling of the situation could have been more empathetic. The key is balancing self-respect with compassion for the roommate's mental health. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer is either A or B, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because their approach was harsh and not considerate of the roommate's condition. But I'm a bit torn because the author isn't wrong in wanting their food to be respected.\n"
