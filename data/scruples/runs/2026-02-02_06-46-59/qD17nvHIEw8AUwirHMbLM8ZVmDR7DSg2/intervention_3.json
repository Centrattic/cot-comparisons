We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 20-year-old woman living with her roommate, also 20. They're planning to move out soon. The roommate is bulimic and has been taking the author's food, replacing it sometimes with different products. The author confronted her, the roommate broke down crying, explaining her bulimia and being on a waitlist for treatment. The author responds by saying she's sorry but it's not her problem, and tells the roommate to buy her own food. The roommate's parents support her financially. The author is upset about the roommate eating her food, even though the roommate replaces it. The author argues that it's not reasonable to take someone else's property regardless of the issue, and she's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the roommate has a mental health issue (bulimia) leading her to take the author's food. The author is upset about the invasion of privacy and the use of her belongings. The author confronts her, leading to the roommate being upset. The author is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of shared living. Roommates typically share common areas and sometimes resources. However, personal belongings, like food in one's own cabinets and fridge, are usually considered individual. So, taking someone else's food without permission is generally considered wrong. But the roommate has a mental health condition that's affecting her behavior.\n\nThe author's response was to tell the roommate to buy her own food, pointing out that even with bulimia, she can't just take food from others in public places. The author is emphasizing personal responsibility and boundaries. However, the roommate is in a vulnerable state and struggling with a disorder that she can't control on her own, as she's on a waitlist for treatment.\n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in being upset about her food being taken without consent. It's reasonable to expect roommates to respect each other's property. On the other hand, the roommate is dealing with a serious mental health issue, which might affect her ability to control her actions. The author's response, while firm, might be seen as not fully considering the roommate's situation, but she's also within her rights to set boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by not showing more empathy. The roommate broke down crying, indicating that the confrontation was distressing for her. The author might have handled it more sensitively, perhaps by offering support or suggesting solutions like using shared food spaces or budgeting help, instead of just telling her to buy her own food. But the author's main point is about personal responsibility, which has merit.\n\nHowever, the author's statement that \"it's not my problem\" and the comparison to eating in public places might come off as cold. It's possible that a more compassionate approach could have been taken without condoning the behavior. The author isn't wrong in setting boundaries, but the way she handled it could be seen as lacking empathy, which might make her the asshole.\n\nBut wait, the roommate is being supported by her parents financially. The author mentions that the roommate could buy her own food. So perhaps the author is right to point out that financial support isn't an excuse for taking others' belongings. The key issue is consent and property rights. The roommate's actions are a violation of the author's space and belongings, regardless of her mental health. While the author could have been more empathetic, the right to privacy and property is valid.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding her own food. However, her approach might have been harsher than necessary. But given the situation, she's justified in being upset. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but some might argue A due to the handling of the situation. It's a bit of a gray area, but the core issue is about respecting property, which the author is justified in upholding.\n"
