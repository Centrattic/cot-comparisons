We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food without permission. The author confronted her, and the roommate explained her situation. But the author is upset because the roommate isn't controlling herself. The author argues that even though the roommate has an eating disorder, she should be able to manage her impulses, especially since she replaces the food. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, and the author feels that she should buy her own food instead of taking others'.\n\nFirst, I should consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious condition that can affect a person's ability to control their behaviors. The roommate is seeking help but hasn't received treatment yet. The author is frustrated because they can't understand why the roommate can't just go to the store and buy her own food, pointing out that it's not acceptable to take from others in public places either.\n\nBut wait, bulimia involves cycles of bingeing and purging. If the roommate is in a binge, she might not be thinking clearly enough to go to the store. Also, buying food might not be feasible if she has financial issues. The author mentions that the roommate is supported by her parents, but maybe that's not the case for groceries. Or maybe the roommate is embarrassed to ask for money for food, leading her to take it instead.\n\nThe author's reaction seems harsh. While it's true that the roommate took their belongings, the author's response of telling her to buy her own food doesn't account for the mental health aspect. The author might not realize that someone with bulimia might not be able to just \"control themselves\" despite knowing it's wrong. The author is asking the roommate to behave in a way that contradicts her illness, which isn't a simple matter of willpower.\n\nHowever, the author also has a right to their personal property. It's reasonable to expect that others don't take your things without permission. The roommate's actions are a violation of that, and the author has a right to be upset. But the key here is how the author handled the situation. Confronting the roommate was necessary, but the way they did it\u2014being angry and not offering any support\u2014might have exacerbated things.\n\nThe roommate tried to explain her issue, and the author dismissed it by comparing it to stealing in public. That could be seen as invalidating the roommate's struggle. The author's statement that it's not their problem and that the roommate should buy her own food might not consider the complexity of the roommate's condition. It's possible that the author is in the right in wanting their food respected, but their approach might have been too harsh, not considering the mental health aspect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The roommate has a mental health issue that affects her control. The author could have been more empathetic and perhaps offered some support, like suggesting they talk to a professional or set boundaries together. Instead, the author came off as angry and dismissive, which might have been unkind. But the action of taking someone's food is wrong, so the author isn't entirely at fault.\n\nThis is a tough call. On one hand, the author has a right to their property. On the other, the roommate's health is a factor. The author's response might not have been the most supportive. Maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong for standing up for their belongings but could have handled it more compassionately. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nConsidering that the author didn't take into account the mental health aspect and responded with anger without offering help, maybe the answer is A. But if the author's main point is about ownership of their food, then B. Hmm. It's tricky. I think the key is that the author didn't consider the roommate's condition in their response, making them partly in the wrong. So perhaps A. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because the roommate is still responsible for her actions despite her illness. The author can't be expected to support the roommate's treatment.\n"
