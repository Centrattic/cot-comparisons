We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue\u2014bulimia. She's on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but can't control it right now. The author is cooking for themselves because they're on a budget and supporting themselves. The roommate is taking the food despite knowing it's wrong, even replacing it, but the author finds it unacceptable.\n\nThe author confronted her, and the roommate was upset. The user is defending their stance by saying it's not unreasonable to expect self-control, comparing it to not taking food in public places. They feel it's their property and the roommate should manage her own needs without invading the author's belongings.\n\nPossible angles: Mental health struggles don't excuse taking others' property, but the author might not be considering the roommate's condition. However, the roommate is replacing the food, so maybe the intent isn't theft. The author's right to their own food is valid, but the approach might have been harsh. The roommate's mental health is a factor here\u2014should there be more leniency?\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't asking for something unreasonable. The roommate is an adult, and the author is in a shared living situation but has boundaries. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with financial constraints. The roommate's actions, while possibly driven by illness, still involve taking without permission. The author's responsibility isn't to manage the roommate's mental health, but to set boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the roommate's condition isn't an excuse for violating boundaries, then the author isn't wrong. But if the author should have been more empathetic and found a solution together, maybe they are. However, the key is that the author didn't attack her condition but asked her to control her actions, which are within their right as an adult. The roommate's issue is personal, but the author isn't obligated to provide food for her disorder. Therefore, the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n"
