We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for confronting their roommate about taking their food, given the roommate's bulimia.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which affects their behavior. They tried to replace the food, but the author still found it unacceptable. The author is on a budget and cooks a lot, so the food is important to them. They confronted the roommate, who then cried and they haven't spoken since.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author's roommate has a condition that's causing them to act in a way they can't control. The author is within their rights to be upset about someone taking their property. However, the author's response was to confront the roommate harshly, which led to emotional distress. The question is whether the author's approach was too harsh, considering the roommate's mental health.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to protect their property and express their feelings. On the other hand, the roommate is struggling with an eating disorder and might need empathy. The author's statement about the roommate needing to control herself might come off as dismissive of the mental health issue, implying it's a choice when it's not. The comparison to stealing in public or restaurants might be a bit of an oversimplification, as the context is different\u2014roommates share living spaces, but the author's food isn't in a public setting.\n\nThe author's response was direct but perhaps unempathetic. However, they did allow the roommate to buy her own food since her parents support her. The roommate's bulimia is a medical condition, not a simple choice. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they handled it might not have considered the roommate's needs for support.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They have valid concerns about their property and the situation, but their approach might not have been compassionate. However, they did address the issue and offered an alternative (buy her own food). The roommate's response was emotional, but the author's actions might not be entirely wrong. Maybe the answer is B (No), but the situation could benefit from more empathy and perhaps finding a middle ground. But according to the options, the answer is either A or B. Given that the author's actions were direct and they did stand up for their rights, but without being cruel beyond a point, maybe B is the answer. However, some might argue A because of the lack of empathy. Hmm.\n"
