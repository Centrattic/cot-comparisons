We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting her bulimic roommate about taking her food. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the roommate has bulimia and is on a waitlist for treatment. She's struggling with binge eating, which leads her to take the author's food without permission. The author, who cooks a lot and is on a budget, feels that her food is being taken and replaced with similar items. She confronted the roommate, who then admitted her issue and apologized. The author expressed frustration, stating that she doesn't think it's acceptable to take others' property, even with a mental health issue, and suggested the roommate should buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. On one hand, the author has a right to her belongings and is within her rights to express her discomfort. She's not at fault for wanting to protect her property. On the other hand, the roommate has a mental health condition that's affecting her behavior. Bulimia can lead to loss of control over eating, and she's already in a vulnerable state, trying to seek help. The author's response was direct and perhaps not empathetic enough. She didn't offer support, just set boundaries. However, she did confront the issue instead of ignoring it, which is reasonable.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author's right to her property, 2) The roommate's mental health struggle, and 3) The author's approach in addressing the problem. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't do anything illegal. She confronted the issue, which is reasonable. However, in a situation involving a mental health issue, the way she communicated her concerns might have been harsh. She could have approached it with more compassion, offering to help her seek resources or support, rather than just placing blame. That said, she's not obligated to accommodate someone's mental health issues at her own expense. The roommate is responsible for her actions, even if she has an illness. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because it's not okay to take others' belongings regardless of the reason. However, the response could have been more supportive. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, I think she's not. She's standing up for her rights and setting boundaries, which is necessary. The roommate needs to take responsibility for her actions, even with her condition. So the answer is B.\n"
