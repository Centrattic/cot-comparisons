We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a bulimia problem and is on a waitlist for treatment. She's been taking the author's food, which the author finds unacceptable. The author confronted her, leading to the roommate breaking down in tears. The author feels justified in their actions, arguing that the roommate should control herself and buy her own food since she's supported by her parents.\n\nNow, considering the situation, bulimia is a serious mental health issue. People with eating disorders often struggle with control and may engage in behaviors they later regret. The roommate's actions might not be a conscious choice but a result of her condition. However, the author is also dealing with their own financial constraints and feels their property rights are violated.\n\nThe key points are: the roommate's health issue, the author's right to their belongings, and the method of confrontation. The author's response was direct and possibly harsh, given the roommate's emotional state. While the author has valid concerns about their food being taken, the way they addressed it could have been more empathetic. Instead of just telling the roommate to control herself or buy her own food, finding a middle ground might have been better, like offering to cook for her if possible or discussing shared responsibilities.\n\nBut the author did acknowledge the roommate's situation and the need to control the behavior. The argument is whether the author's approach was reasonable. The roommate's mental health is a factor here. The author's statement that \"it's not socially acceptable to take other people's property\" is true, but in the context of someone with a disorder, expecting the same level of control might be unrealistic. The roommate is in a vulnerable state, and the author's response might have been insensitive.\n\nHowever, the author is also within their rights to expect their property not to be taken without consent. The line here is between respecting the roommate's health issues and maintaining personal boundaries. The author's approach might have been harsh, but they aren't entirely wrong for wanting to protect their belongings. There's a balance between empathy and setting boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their approach could have been more compassionate. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since the roommate's actions are due to a disorder, the author's response might be seen as lacking understanding. But the author did confront the issue, which is necessary for their own comfort. This is a bit of a gray area, but I think the author is not in the wrong because they addressed a legitimate issue, even if the method could have been softer.\n"
