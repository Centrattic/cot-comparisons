We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their roommate about taking food. The roommate has bulimia and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author cooks a lot and the roommate is taking the food, trying to replace it with different products. The author confronted her, and the roommate broke down. Now they're not talking.\n\nHmm. The author is saying that they think it's not unreasonable to expect their roommate to control herself. But the roommate has a mental health issue. The author didn't know about the bulimia until confronting her. The key points here are the author's response and the roommate's mental health.\n\nThe author told the roommate that she can buy her own food since her parents support her. That might be harsh. The roommate is already struggling with an eating disorder, so adding financial pressure could be counterproductive. The author might not fully understand the severity of the roommate's condition. Also, the roommate is trying to replace the food, so maybe she's trying to compensate, but the author doesn't accept that because it's not their food.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is paying for the food and it's their apartment. They have a right to their things. The roommate's actions are still taking something that's not hers, regardless of her mental state. The author might have handled it poorly, maybe without empathy, but is it their fault to stand up for their own belongings?\n\nWait, but the author's response was confrontational and made the roommate cry. Maybe they should have approached it differently, like offering to help her find resources instead of just being angry. The author's argument that it's not socially acceptable to take other people's property is valid, but they didn't consider the roommate's mental health in the situation. The roommate is in a vulnerable state, and the author's reaction might have made her feel more isolated.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They have a right to their food, but their response might have been insensitive. Maybe they are partially in the wrong for not being more understanding and for not considering the roommate's mental health when confronting her. The key is whether their actions were reasonable given the roommate's condition. The answer could be A (they are in the wrong) because their approach was harsh without addressing the underlying issue. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they have a right to their property and the roommate should have controlled her behavior. But the way the author handled it was probably not the best, which might tip the scale towards A.\n"
