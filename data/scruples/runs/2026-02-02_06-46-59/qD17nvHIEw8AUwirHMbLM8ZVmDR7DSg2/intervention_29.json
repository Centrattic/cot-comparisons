We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with a roommate who has bulimia. The roommate has been taking the author's food without asking, which leads to the author confronting her. The roommate explains her issue, but the author is upset and tells her to buy her own food since her parents support her. The roommate is upset after and they haven't spoken since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder, and the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment. She's trying to manage her condition but is struggling with binging. She replaces the food, but the author is still upset about it. The author's main point is about ownership and control over their own property. They argue that just because someone has a disorder doesn't mean they can take others' things.\n\nBut wait, the roommate is in a vulnerable state. The author might be right that taking someone else's food is wrong, but the roommate is dealing with a mental health issue that's causing her to act this way. The author's response was to tell the roommate to buy her own food, implying that it's her responsibility to manage her condition. However, the roommate's parents support her financially, so maybe she can afford her own food. But is that the author's role to enforce? The author is in a shared living situation, so maybe there's some shared responsibility in maintaining a respectful environment.\n\nThe author's actions might have been a bit harsh. Confronting someone who is already struggling with a mental health issue can be very impactful. Breaking down the roommate emotionally might not have been helpful. The author could have approached it with more empathy, maybe suggesting alternatives like eating the author's food with permission, or helping her find resources until she gets treatment. The author's response was more about asserting ownership and anger, which might not address the underlying issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't at fault for being upset about their food being taken. It's reasonable to expect that others respect your belongings. The author might feel that the roommate should manage her behavior, especially if it's affecting the author's living situation. However, the key here is how the confrontation was handled. The author didn't seem to consider the roommate's mental health aspect as much as the roommate's own responsibility. The roommate is trying to replace the food, so maybe the author could have found a middle ground instead of being confrontational and unempathetic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not showing enough empathy towards the roommate's mental health crisis, even though the roommate's actions were wrong. The author's response could have been more compassionate, and perhaps they could have offered support rather than just reprimanding her. The fact that the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment and is already struggling makes the situation more complex. The author's approach might have exacerbated the roommate's distress rather than helping to solve the problem.\n"
