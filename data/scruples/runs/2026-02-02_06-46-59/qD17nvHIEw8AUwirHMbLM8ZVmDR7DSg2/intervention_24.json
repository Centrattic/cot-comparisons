We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a roommate (F20) whose bulimic roommate is taking her food without permission. The author cooked meals because they're on a budget, and noticed food being taken and replaced with different products. When confronted, the roommate admitted to binging on the author's food due to her bulimia. The author told her that she needs to control herself and that she can buy her own food since her parents support her. Now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is that their roommate is taking their food without consent, even if the roommate is trying to replace it. The roommate has a mental health issue (bulimia) which is a serious condition, and she's on a waitlist for treatment. She's clearly struggling and feels bad about it. \n\nThe author's argument is that they're not okay with someone taking their property, regardless of the reason. They compare it to not taking food from a store or restaurant, implying that it's not acceptable regardless of the circumstances. They also mention that they\u2019re paying for the food because they support themselves, while the roommate's parents support her.\n\nBut wait, the roommate is paying her share of the rent and bills, right? The author says the roommate pays everything on time. So maybe the roommate isn't intentionally trying to avoid her share by taking food. However, the act of taking food without permission is still a problem for the author. The key here is consent and mutual respect. Even if the roommate is struggling with her eating disorder, the author's property is being used without their consent. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious illness, and the person might not have full control over their actions. The author's approach was to confront her, which she took as criticism, leading to a breakdown. The author might have been too harsh in their response, but they also have the right to their belongings. \n\nThe author's response seems a bit harsh. They told the roommate that it's not their problem and that she can buy her own food. However, the roommate mentioned her parents support her, so maybe the author is correct in pointing out that she can afford her own food. But the author is on a budget, so they can't afford to lose their food. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their property and the privacy of their food. On the other, the roommate is dealing with a mental health issue that's causing her to act in a way she can't control. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps suggesting solutions like eating together or finding a compromise. Instead, the author's response was to accuse and tell the roommate she's wrong, which might have been hurtful given her vulnerable state.\n\nBut if the author's main concern is about their property being taken without consent, then they're justified in wanting the roommate to stop. However, the way they handled it might have been too confrontational without considering the roommate's mental health. The author might not be in the wrong for standing up for their own needs, but they could have been more understanding. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is the asshole, it's a bit of a gray area. They have valid concerns about their property and privacy. However, the response might have been insensitive. The roommate is in a vulnerable situation, and the author's approach could have been more compassionate. But the author didn't force the roommate to do anything; they just expressed their discomfort and set a boundary. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the situation. Since the author is on a budget and the roommate is taking food without consent, the author's stance is understandable. However, the way they communicated it might have been harsh. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. It's a tough call, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're standing up for their own needs, even if the approach could have been more empathetic.\n"
