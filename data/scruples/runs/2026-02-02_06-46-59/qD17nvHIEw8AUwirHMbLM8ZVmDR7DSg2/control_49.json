We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue\u2014bulimia. That's a serious condition that affects self-control and behavior. The author noticed food being taken and replaced, which led to a confrontation where the roommate admitted to binging. \n\nThe author then expresses frustration, stating that the roommate should control herself and buy her own food, especially since she's supported by her parents. They argue that it's not acceptable to take others' property regardless of mental health issues. \n\nBut wait, mental health can impair someone's ability to control their actions. Even if the roommate knows it's wrong, her condition might make it difficult to stop. The author's approach was to confront her, which might have been necessary to address the issue, but the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the roommate should exercise restraint, similar to how they do. However, comparing oneself to someone with a mental illness isn't fair. Not everyone can control impulses in the same way, especially when there's an underlying disorder. \n\nAlso, the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which means she's seeking help but hasn't received it yet. That might be a factor in her current behavior. The author's ultimatum to buy her own food might not be practical if the roommate can't afford it or if her parents aren't providing for her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's food is their personal property, and having someone take it without permission is a violation of trust and boundaries. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset or for setting boundaries, but the way they handled it could have been more empathetic. \n\nThe key points here are: the roommate's mental health, the author's right to privacy and property, and the need for both parties to communicate and find a solution. The author might not be the asshole because they are within their rights to want their property respected, but their approach could have been more compassionate. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is standing up for their own belongings and setting clear boundaries, which is reasonable, but the way they did it might have lacked understanding. However, the roommate's actions (taking food and replacing it with different products) are still a breach, so the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but they could have been more understanding. But the main issue is the unauthorized use of property, which the author is justified in addressing.\n"
