We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food without permission. The author cooks a lot because they're on a budget and noticed missing or replaced items. When confronted, the roommate admitted to the behavior, apologized, and explained her condition. The author responded by saying it's not their problem and that the roommate should buy her own food. The author is now wondering if they were too harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are the roommate's mental health issue and the author's reaction. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can affect self-control. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but not yet receiving it. The author's main issue is that they feel their property is being taken without consent, even if the roommate is struggling.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to expect their belongings, including food, to be respected. Taking someone's food without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. The author is covering their own costs and the roommate's parents are supporting her, so there's a financial aspect here that the author points out.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate's bulimia is a health issue that impairs her control. The author's response was firm but perhaps not entirely dismissive. They acknowledged the roommate's problem but set a boundary. However, the way they phrased it (\"it shouldn't be my problem\") might come off as uncaring, even if the author's intention was to set a boundary. The author could have perhaps offered a more supportive approach, like suggesting alternatives or encouraging the roommate to seek help, rather than just telling her to buy her own food.\n\nThe roommate's reaction (crying, not speaking since) indicates that the confrontation was emotionally impactful. The author might have handled it more sensitively, considering the roommate's mental health. However, the roommate's behavior (taking food despite knowing it's wrong) does need to stop, as it's a violation of the author's boundaries.\n\nBalancing these factors, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for setting a boundary, but the way they communicated it might have been harsher than necessary, given the roommate's condition. However, the roommate is responsible for her actions and needs to find ways to manage her health, which includes respecting others' property. The author's demand for self-control is reasonable in general, but the context of a mental health issue complicates things. So, the answer might depend on whether the author's approach was too confrontational without offering support, but the core issue of respecting property rights is on the author's side.\n"
