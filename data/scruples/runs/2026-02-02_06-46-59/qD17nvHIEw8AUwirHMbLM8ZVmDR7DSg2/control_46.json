We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a roommate with bulimia taking the author's food. The author confronts her, and there's some fallout. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The roommate has a mental health condition, which is bulimia. She's struggling with bingeing and isn't able to control herself, hence taking the author's food. She's trying to replace the food but the author is upset because it's their property. The author argues that even with the condition, taking someone else's belongings isn't acceptable, similar to taking from a grocery store or restaurant. The author also mentions that the roommate's parents support her financially, implying she can buy her own food.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their property and belongings. It's understandable to be upset about someone taking things without permission. The author is on a budget and cooking for themselves, so the food is a necessity. The roommate's actions are violating that boundary, regardless of the reason. The author isn't being cruel; they're setting a boundary and explaining their stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a serious health issue. Bulimia is a mental illness that can be really hard to manage, especially without proper treatment. The roommate is already in a vulnerable situation, on a waitlist for help. The author's confrontation led to the roommate crying and them not speaking since, which might indicate that the approach could have been more empathetic. However, the author did express some understanding by apologizing for being mad. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of just telling her to control herself, perhaps offering support or suggesting they find a solution together, like maybe cooking extra for her if possible, or helping her find immediate help. However, the author also has their own needs and might not be in a position to provide that support, especially if they're on a budget themselves.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking the roommate to control herself. The author isn't blaming her for the illness but is stating that it shouldn't affect their own property. The roommate's actions are still problematic regardless of the reason. The author's main issue is that the roommate is taking things without permission, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut maybe the author could have been more compassionate in their delivery. The way they confronted her might have been harsh, leading to the emotional response. But the core of the issue is the act of taking food without consent, which is a boundary violation. The roommate's condition complicates things, but it doesn't make the action acceptable. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary and asking their roommate to respect their property. It's reasonable to expect that, even with a mental health issue. However, the approach could have been more supportive. But since the question is about whether they're in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for standing up for their property and setting limits. The roommate's actions are the problem, not the author's response.\n"
