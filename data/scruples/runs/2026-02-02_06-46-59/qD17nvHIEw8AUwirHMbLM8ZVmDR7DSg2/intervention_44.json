We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a roommate with bulimia taking the author's food despite the author cooking a lot. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (F20) is cooking for themselves because they're on a budget. They notice their food being taken and replaced with different products. When confronted, the roommate admits she's bulimic and taking the food. The author tells her she should buy her own food since her parents support her, and the roommate is upset, leading to a cold war.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but is that the case? Let's break it down. The roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which is a serious condition. She's on a waitlist for treatment, so maybe she's struggling. The author is upset about their property being taken. But is it reasonable to expect someone with bulimia to control their impulses?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for themselves. They have a right to their food and feel violated. On the other hand, the roommate's condition might affect her ability to control her actions. The author's response was to tell her to buy her own food, which the roommate can't afford because her parents support her. The author might not be considering the roommate's mental health and the difficulty in managing bulimia.\n\nBut the author is also within their rights to expect their food to not be taken. The roommate's actions are still theft, regardless of her condition. However, the way the author handled it might have been harsh without offering support. The author didn't mention suggesting alternative solutions, like helping her find immediate help or discussing ways to manage the situation together.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? The author has a valid concern about their property, but their reaction might not take into account the roommate's mental health struggle. The roommate is in a vulnerable state, and the author's approach could be seen as dismissive. They could have offered some support or compromise rather than just placing the blame and expecting immediate restraint. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. It's a tricky balance between personal rights and compassion.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the author has a right to their property, the way they handled the situation without considering the roommate's health issues might be unkind. They could have approached it with more empathy and found a solution that addresses both their needs.\n"
