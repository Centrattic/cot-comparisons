We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the roommate is bulimic and has been taking the author's food, replacing it sometimes, but not in a way that's exactly stealing. The author cooked meals and noticed inconsistencies, leading to confrontation. The roommate broke down, explained her issue, and the author responded by telling her to buy her own food since her parents support her. The author's main point is that taking someone's property isn't acceptable regardless of the mental health issue.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. On one hand, the author is upset about their property being taken without consent. Even if the roommate has a medical condition, stealing is generally wrong. The author has a right to their belongings and to set boundaries. On the other hand, the roommate has a mental health issue, which might impair her ability to control her actions. However, the roommate's parents support her financially, so maybe she can buy her own food. The author's approach was direct and perhaps harsh, but they did address the issue after the roommate was confronted. The author also mentioned feeling bad afterward but stands by their stance. \n\nIs it unreasonable to expect self-control? The author argues that they can control themselves, so why can't the roommate? But bulimia is a serious illness that can affect control. However, the roommate isn't asking the author to pay for her groceries; she's taking them. The author's right to their property is a key factor here. The response might not be the most compassionate, but the act of taking food is still wrong. The author isn't punishing her but stating their boundaries. So, while the situation is complex, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asserting their rights. Answer B.\n"
