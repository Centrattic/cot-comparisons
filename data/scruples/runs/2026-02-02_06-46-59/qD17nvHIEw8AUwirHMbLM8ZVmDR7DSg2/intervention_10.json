We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. The roommate has a mental health issue and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author found out the roommate was taking their food and confronted her, leading to a breakdown.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: They confronted the roommate directly after noticing the food issues. The roommate admitted she has bulimia and can't control herself. The author's main argument is that it's not acceptable to take someone else's food, regardless of the mental health issue. They also mentioned that the roommate's parents support her financially, implying she can buy her own food.\n\nNow, the roommate's situation: She's struggling with bulimia, which is a serious eating disorder. She's on a waitlist for treatment, so she might not have immediate access to help. Her taking the author's food is a compulsion she can't control. The author's reaction is that they're upset about their property being taken and that the roommate isn't managing her condition, which they feel is her responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and mental health. The author is within their rights to ask the roommate to stop taking their food. However, how they confronted the roommate might be an issue. The author was firm and maybe a bit dismissive of the roommate's mental health struggle. Phrases like \"it shouldn't be my problem\" and comparing her actions to stealing from a store might come off as insensitive. The author didn't offer support or solutions, just told the roommate to buy her own food. That could be seen as not considering the roommate's mental health challenges.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their property and to feel respected. The roommate's actions are indeed wrong, but given her mental health, it's possible she's acting out of a compulsion she can't control. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps setting clear boundaries while acknowledging the roommate's struggle and suggesting alternatives, like eating out or using her own food.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did confront the roommate about a legitimate issue, which is necessary. However, the way they did it might have been harsh and didn't take into account the roommate's mental health. The author could have been more compassionate and offered solutions rather than just demanding self-control. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been more understanding. The answer would be B (No), but maybe with some nuance.\n"
