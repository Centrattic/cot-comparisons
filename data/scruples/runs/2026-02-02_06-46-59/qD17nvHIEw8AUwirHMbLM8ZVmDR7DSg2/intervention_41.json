We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia taking the author's food, and the author confronting her.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a health issue\u2014bulimia\u2014and is on a waitlist for treatment. That's a serious mental health struggle. The author notices food being taken and replaces it, but it's clear the roommate is taking it without permission. The author confronts her, leading to an emotional breakdown. The author then expresses frustration, saying they don't think they did anything wrong.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The roommate's actions are wrong\u2014taking someone else's property without permission, regardless of the reason. However, the roommate is dealing with a mental health issue. The author's response was to confront her, which the roommate took as harsh. The author then says things like \"it shouldn't be my problem\" and mentions that the roommate can buy her own food. The author also compares it to taking from a grocery store or restaurant, implying it's not acceptable regardless of the situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's food is their own property, and the roommate is violating that. The author is within their rights to expect their belongings to be respected. However, the author's approach might have been insensitive. Confronting someone with a mental health struggle in a direct and potentially harsh way could be seen as lacking empathy. But the author did attempt to be nice afterward.\n\nSo, the roommate's actions are clearly wrong, but the author's handling of the confrontation might not have been the most compassionate approach. However, the author is not in the wrong for expecting their property to be respected. The roommate's mental health doesn't excuse the theft, even if it's a symptom of her condition. The author's frustration is understandable, and they have a right to set boundaries. Therefore, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong), but the situation is nuanced where both sides have some flaws.\n"
