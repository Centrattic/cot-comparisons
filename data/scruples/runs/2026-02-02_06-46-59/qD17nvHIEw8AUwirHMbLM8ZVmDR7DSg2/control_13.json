We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. The roommate has a known eating disorder and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author is upset because the roommate is taking their food and replacing it, but they feel it's not acceptable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious condition where a person might lose control over their eating habits, and it's not just about willpower. The fact that the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment suggests they are seeking help, which is a good sign. But the author is paying for the food and is within their rights to protect their belongings. \n\nThe author did confront the roommate, and the roommate was emotional. The author then said that the roommate can buy her own food since her parents support her. That part might be harsh because the roommate is dealing with an eating disorder, which can be influenced by factors like financial stress or lack of access to food. Even if the roommate's parents support her, maybe she's not using that support for groceries, or there could be other issues.\n\nBut the author's main point is about the expectation of personal boundaries. They cook a lot and are on a budget, so it's a financial issue. The roommate taking the food is a breach of trust and a financial burden. The author's response, while maybe not the kindest, might be justified in terms of wanting to protect their own resources. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, considering the roommate's mental health. Maybe suggesting alternatives, like setting up a shared pantry with clear boundaries, or encouraging the roommate to use the support from her parents to purchase her own food. But the author's actions were to directly confront and state their stance, which the roommate found hurtful.\n\nThe key here is balancing the author's right to privacy and property with the roommate's mental health. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing the issue, but the way they handled it might not have been the most supportive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong at all. Since the roommate is taking someone else's food, which is a violation of trust and social norms regardless of the reason, the author's frustration is valid. \n\nBut the answer might depend on the severity of the disorder and the steps taken to address it. The author could have been more understanding, given the roommate's condition, but they also have a right to their own property. It's a tough call. The roommate's actions are wrong, but the author's response might have been too harsh, considering the roommate's mental health. However, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they are being honest about their feelings. \n\nSo maybe the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation requires more empathy. But some might argue that the author should have been more compassionate. However, the roommate is the one taking the food, and the author is within their rights to ask her to stop. The author's statement about controlling oneself is a valid point, as the roommate is expected to manage her condition, even if it's challenging. \n\nIn the end, while the author could have handled it more sensitively, they are not in the wrong for addressing the issue. The roommate's actions are the problem, not the author's response. So the answer is B.\n"
