We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia taking food from them without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is paying for their own food and cooking a lot because of budget constraints. Their roommate is taking the food, even replacing it with different items, which is confusing and makes the author uncomfortable. The roommate admitted to struggling with bulimia and is on a waitlist for treatment. The author confronted her, leading to a breakdown, but then stood by their stance that the roommate should control herself and buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their property. Taking someone else's food without asking is generally wrong, regardless of the reason. The roommate's behavior is inappropriate, and the author is within their rights to ask her to stop. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when dealing with their own budget and stress about moving.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health issue. Bulimia is a serious condition that can affect someone's ability to control their impulses. The author might not have fully considered the impact of their confrontation on the roommate's mental health. However, the author didn't attack the roommate's condition directly; they expressed their own boundaries and consequences. The roommate's responsibility to seek help and manage her condition is also a factor here.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to their property versus the roommate's health struggles. While the author's approach could have been more empathetic, the act of taking food without permission is a violation of boundaries. The author isn't wrong for standing up for themselves, especially in a shared living situation where mutual respect is crucial. The roommate needs to take responsibility for her actions and find solutions, like buying her own food as suggested. The author's response, though firm, is about setting personal limits, which is reasonable.\n"
