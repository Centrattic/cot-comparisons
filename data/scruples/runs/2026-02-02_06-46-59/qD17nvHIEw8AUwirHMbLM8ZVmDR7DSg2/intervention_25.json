We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's roommate has bulimia and is taking the author's food without permission, even replacing it with different products. The author confronted the roommate, who apologized and explained her condition. The author then told her that while it's not her problem, the roommate should buy her own food since her parents support her. The roommate cried, and they haven't spoken since. The author is asking if they're the asshole for setting that boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which is a serious eating disorder. People with bulimia often have issues with control over eating, and it's not just about willpower. The author is upset because their food is being taken without consent, even if it's being replaced. The author is on a budget and cooking for themselves, so having someone else take their food could be frustrating. They might feel their personal space and property is being invaded.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a shared living situation. Roommates share common areas and resources, but personal belongings in one's own space (like a fridge or cupboard) are generally considered private. The roommate taking the author's food without permission is a breach of that privacy. The author is within their rights to be upset about it. However, how they handled the confrontation might be where the issue is. The roommate was crying and apologetic, but the author's response was to tell her to buy her own food, which the roommate might not afford, especially since the author mentions the roommate's parents support her. But if the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, maybe she's already struggling financially or emotionally.\n\nThe author might not have considered the roommate's mental health struggles when setting the boundary. They dismissed the roommate's explanation and didn't offer support. Instead, they made it about the roommate's responsibility. The author could have tried to find a compromise, like setting up a shared pantry with agreed-upon items or discussing meal times. However, the author's main point is that it's not acceptable to take others' belongings, regardless of the situation. The author is right in that taking someone's food without permission is wrong, but the way they handled it might have been harsh given the roommate's mental health.\n\nAnother angle: the author is responsible for their own food and might not want to enable someone's disorder by not setting a boundary. But at the same time, the author is in a position to be understanding given the roommate's condition. The line between holding someone accountable and being empathetic is tricky here. The author's response could be seen as dismissive of the roommate's mental health, which might make them the asshole. But if the author is not willing to tolerate the behavior, even with empathy, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nI think the key factors are: 1) the roommate's mental health, 2) the author's right to their belongings, 3) how the confrontation was handled. The author is in a valid position for wanting their food left alone, but the approach taken might have lacked compassion. However, the roommate's actions are still wrong, regardless of her condition. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary, but they could have handled it more sensitively. The question is whether the author overstepped by being harsh in their response. Since the author is asking if they're the asshole, the community usually considers the balance between accountability and empathy. In this case, the roommate's actions are a problem, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive. So maybe the author is not in the wrong, but they could have been more understanding. However, the main issue is the roommate taking food, which is a breach of personal space. The answer might be B (no), because the author is within their rights to set that boundary, even if the handling was a bit abrupt.\n"
