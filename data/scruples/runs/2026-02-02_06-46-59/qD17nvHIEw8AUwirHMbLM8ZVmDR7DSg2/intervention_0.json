We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia taking the author's food. The author confronted the roommate, who was upset and explained her condition. The author is now apologizing for being upset and expects the roommate to control herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which is a serious disorder. She's on a waitlist for treatment, so she might be struggling without immediate help. She's taking food, which is understandable given her condition, but it's still a problem because it's the author's property.\n\nThe author is paying for the food and cooks a lot. The roommate is replacing the food, but the author is upset about the invasion of privacy and the fact that it's their food. The author's reaction was to tell the roommate to buy her own food since her parents support her. The author feels that the roommate should have self-control, similar to how they do.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective. They might be frustrated because their belongings are being taken without consent. It's reasonable to expect others not to take your things, even with a mental health issue. However, the author's response might have been harsh. The roommate was already in a vulnerable state, and the confrontation led to her crying and them not speaking since.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate's condition could affect her ability to control her impulses. While she knows it's wrong, the disorder might make it difficult. The author might not fully understand the compulsion aspect of bulimia. But, the roommate's actions are still a violation of the author's property and privacy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA format usually looks at whether the person acted unreasonably or without empathy. The author did confront the roommate, which is reasonable, but the response might have been too harsh. The author could have offered support or suggested solutions instead of just telling the roommate to buy her own food. However, the roommate's behavior is still wrong, and the author has the right to protect their belongings.\n\nIn terms of the balance, the author might be in the right to expect their food not to be taken. But the way they handled it could be seen as insensitive, given the roommate's mental health. However, the roommate's actions are problematic regardless. The answer might depend on whether the author's expectations are unreasonable. Since they cooked for themselves and the roommate is taking their food, it's a valid concern. The author is not wrong in wanting their belongings respected, even if the roommate has an issue. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance.\n"
