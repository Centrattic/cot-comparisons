We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia who takes the author's food without asking.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is F20, living with a roommate who is also F20. The roommate has bulimia and takes the author's food, replacing it sometimes but not exactly. The author confronts her, leading to a breakdown. The main issue is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author argues that even though the roommate has a problem, they should control themselves. The roommate's parents support her financially, so the author thinks she can buy her own food. The author feels it's not acceptable to take someone else's property, regardless of the mental health issue.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics. Roommates often share spaces, but personal property is usually respected. The roommate's actions are a result of a mental health condition, which complicates things. The author's frustration is valid because their belongings are being used without consent. However, the way the author confronted the roommate (making her cry, cutting off communication) might be too harsh, especially when the roommate is struggling with an eating disorder.\n\nThe roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so she's seeking help. The author's response was to tell her it's her problem and that she can buy her own food. While the author's point about personal responsibility is valid, the situation involves someone with a mental health issue that they can't control easily. The author might not fully understand the compulsive nature of bulimia. \n\nOn the other hand, the roommate did replace items, but not always the correct ones, which is still a problem. The author's right to privacy and ownership of their food is important. However, the confrontation method might be seen as insensitive, especially without offering support or discussing solutions together. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on balancing personal boundaries and empathy. The author isn't wrong for wanting their property respected, but their approach could be seen as lacking compassion. However, the roommate's actions are harmful, so the author is also within their rights to set boundaries. It's a tricky situation where both parties have valid points. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who maintains respect while setting boundaries is considered not the asshole. The author did confront the roommate but did so in a way that caused emotional distress. However, the roommate's actions are also problematic. The key is whether the author overstepped. The answer might be B (not the asshole) because the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their boundaries, even if the method was harsh. But some might argue the author should have been more understanding. It's a close call, but leaning towards B.\n"
