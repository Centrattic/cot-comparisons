We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food without permission, even replacing it with different products. The author confronted her, and the roommate admitted to the issue but is on a waitlist for treatment. The author is upset because they don't think the roommate should take their belongings, regardless of her condition.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're both adults and it's reasonable to expect self-control. They don't want the roommate to eat their food, even if she replaces it, because it's their property. The roommate is clearly distressed and struggling with her illness.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their property and to feel respected. It's not okay for someone to take things without permission. But bulimia is a serious mental health condition that can impair a person's control. The roommate might not be able to resist the urge despite knowing it's wrong. The author's response was direct, which might be necessary, but the way they framed it as \"it's not my problem\" could be harsh, especially when the roommate is already in a vulnerable state.\n\nThe author could have handled the situation with more empathy. Instead of just demanding control, maybe offering support or finding another solution, like contributing to a shared food budget or encouraging the roommate to seek help. However, the author is also responsible for their own resources and might not be able to support the roommate financially. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting the roommate's condition and upholding personal boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but their approach might have been too harsh. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since the roommate is actively seeking treatment and the author is providing a safe environment, maybe the author is justified in enforcing their boundaries. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's demand for control is unreasonable given the roommate's condition. While the author has the right to their property, the roommate's mental health is a factor. However, the author isn't obligated to accommodate the roommate's disorder beyond what's reasonable. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. But the harshness of the confrontation could be an issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is within their rights to ask for their property to be respected. However, they could have approached it more empathetically. The main issue is the theft, which is wrong regardless of the reason. The roommate's condition doesn't excuse the behavior, so the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n"
