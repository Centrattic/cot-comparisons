We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their roommate about taking food, given the roommate's bulimia.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia. The author noticed food going missing and confronted the roommate, who then revealed her problem. The author's response was firm, telling the roommate to buy her own food or control herself, comparing it to not taking food at a grocery store or another person's table. \n\nThe roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so she's seeking help but can't control her impulses yet. The author is paying for their own food, which they need for survival, and the roommate's actions are affecting that. The author's argument is that it's about self-control, similar to how they control themselves with food. \n\nNow, the key points to consider: the roommate has a mental health condition that's affecting her ability to control her actions. The author is asking her to exercise restraint that a person with bulimia might find extremely difficult. On the other hand, the author is within their rights to want their food respected. But the way the author handled the confrontation might come across as harsh, especially without offering support. The author didn't mention discussing possible solutions, like sharing expenses or helping the roommate get help, which might have been a more compassionate approach. \n\nThe author's comparison to taking food in public isn't entirely fair because the roommate isn't in a public setting but a shared living space, which can be more complex. However, the principle of respecting others' property is valid. \n\nBalancing mental health and personal boundaries is tricky. The roommate's condition is a valid health issue, but the author's needs are also legitimate. The author could have approached the situation with more empathy, acknowledging the roommate's struggle while setting clear boundaries. Instead, the author's response was confrontational, which may have worsened the situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have the right to their food and set boundaries. However, their approach was lacking in empathy and support, which might be where they went wrong. But since the question is whether they are in the wrong overall, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the roommate's condition. The roommate's inability to control her impulses due to bulimia is a significant factor here. The author's demand for control without offering support might be seen as unreasonable, making the author partially at fault. However, I think the roommate's condition is a mitigating factor, so the author's firm stance might be seen as justified but their handling of it could be improved. But given the options, the answer is tricky. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they had the right to confront the issue. However, the way they did it might not be the best approach. Given the options, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
