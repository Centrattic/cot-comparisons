We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their roommate about taking her food because the roommate is bulimic. \n\nFirst, the roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which is a serious condition. The author noticed food being taken and replaced, which they found upsetting. They confronted the roommate, who then broke down crying and explained her condition. The author responded by saying it's not their problem and that the roommate should buy her own food since her parents support her. \n\nThe key points here are: the roommate has a diagnosed issue, the author is upset about their belongings being taken, and the author's response might have been harsh. The author's argument is that the roommate should control herself, like they do, but the roommate's condition makes that difficult. \n\nNow, considering mental health, people with eating disorders often struggle with control. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so she's seeking help but can't control it right now. The author's reaction, while understandable, might not take into account the roommate's mental state. \n\nHowever, the author has a right to their property and privacy. The roommate taking food without permission is an issue regardless of the reason. But the way the author handled it\u2014telling the roommate it's not their problem and that she should just buy her own\u2014might be dismissive of the roommate's struggle. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a balance between respecting boundaries and showing compassion. The author's anger is valid because their property is being used without consent. But the response could have been more empathetic. Instead of cutting off communication and being confrontational, maybe suggesting ways to help, like supporting the roommate in getting treatment or setting up a shared food system. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for themselves, but their approach might have been harsh. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is about the action of confronting and the response, then maybe the author is partially at fault for not being understanding. But the roommate's actions are also wrong regardless of the reason. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the roommate's behavior is problematic, the author's response was unkind and didn't consider the roommate's mental health. The author could have addressed the issue more compassionately, offering support rather than blame. The roommate is struggling with a serious illness, and the author's reaction might have worsened the situation.\n"
