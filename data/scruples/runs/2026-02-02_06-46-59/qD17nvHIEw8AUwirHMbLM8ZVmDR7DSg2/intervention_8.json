We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their roommate, who has bulimia, taking their food without permission. The author confronted the roommate, and now they're questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can make people act out of control, even if they know it's wrong. The roommate mentioned she's on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's actively seeking help but isn't currently receiving it. This could impact her ability to control her impulses.\n\nThe author's main points are that they cook all the meals and that the roommate is taking their food despite replacing it. The author argues that they shouldn't have to accommodate the roommate's disorder and that the roommate should control herself. But is it reasonable to expect someone with bulimia to control themselves in a shared living space?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their belongings and their food. Taking someone's property without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. The author is paying for the food they cook, so it's their responsibility to manage their own resources. The roommate's actions, even if driven by a disorder, are still an invasion of the author's personal property.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate is struggling with a mental health issue. The author's response was confrontational, leading to the roommate breaking down. The author then told the roommate to buy her own food since her parents support her. This could be seen as dismissive of the roommate's condition and the fact that she's in a difficult situation. The author might not fully grasp how bulimia affects a person's behavior. People with bulimia often feel ashamed and may not know how to ask for help, leading to secretive behaviors like taking food.\n\nThe author's comparison to taking food at a grocery store or restaurant might not be the best analogy. In those public spaces, there are clear boundaries and rules, whereas in a shared apartment, the lines can be blurred. The roommate might not consider her actions as taking, especially if she's in a state of disordered eating where she's not fully aware of her actions.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to confront the roommate directly might have been necessary, but the way they did it\u2014by expressing anger and then telling the roommate to buy her own food\u2014might have been harsh. They could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps by suggesting solutions like setting up a separate food area or discussing ways to manage the roommate's needs without compromising the author's own.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The author could have tried to communicate earlier or set boundaries before the situation escalated. The roommate, on the other hand, should ideally seek help to manage her disorder, but that's not entirely within her control if she's on a waitlist.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might not be entirely wrong in standing up for their own property and boundaries. However, their approach could have been more compassionate and less confrontational. The key issue is balancing the roommate's mental health needs with the author's right to privacy and property. The author's actions, while justified in part, might have lacked the necessary empathy and understanding for the roommate's condition, which could be seen as a misstep.\n"
