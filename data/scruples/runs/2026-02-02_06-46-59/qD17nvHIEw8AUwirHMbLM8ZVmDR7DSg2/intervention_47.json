We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a roommate with bulimia taking the author's food. The author confronted her, and now they're upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They cook a lot because they're on a budget and their roommate isn't cooking. The roommate is taking their food, even replacing it with similar items, but the author is upset about it. They confronted the roommate, who was crying and explained her condition. The author argues that regardless of the issue, taking someone else's food isn't acceptable, just like not taking from a store or restaurant.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a mental health struggle. Bulimia involves cycles of binging and purging, which can be hard to control. The author's response was to tell her to buy her own food since her parents support her. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's trying to get help but can't right now.\n\nNow, the author's actions: they confronted her, which is understandable, but the way they handled it might have been harsh. They didn't acknowledge the roommate's mental health issue beyond understanding but not accepting it. The author might not realize the severity of the situation or how their words affected the roommate. The roommate cried and now there's tension. The author might not see how their words could have been unkind or not supportive enough.\n\nBut then, the author is also within their rights to expect boundaries. It's not okay for someone to take another person's property, regardless of their issues. However, the author might have approached the situation without sufficient empathy. They compared it to stealing from a store, which could minimize the roommate's problem. The key here is whether the author's response was disproportionately harsh given the roommate's mental health situation.\n\nI think it's a balance between respecting boundaries and showing compassion. The author had a right to be upset about their food being taken, but how they handled it might have been insensitive. They could have offered support instead of making the roommate feel shamed, especially given her vulnerability. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong because they didn't approach it with enough understanding. But then again, setting boundaries is also important. It's a tough call. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because they didn't show enough empathy. If B (no), it's because they're within their rights to expect respect for their property. I think the community might lean towards B because the author isn't at fault for wanting to protect their belongings, but the way they handled it could be improved. However, in the context of \"AITA\" questions, sometimes the answer hinges on whether the approach was considerate. Since the roommate has a mental health issue, the author might not be in the wrong, but they could have been more supportive. But the initial question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer probably hinges on whether they were unreasonable in their expectations. The author might not be in the wrong for setting a boundary, but the way they did it could be improved. So I'm leaning towards B (No), but the author could have handled it better. However, the core of the question is if they're \"in the wrong,\" which might mean morally or ethically. Given that, maybe A is correct because they didn't consider the roommate's condition enough. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think in this case, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary, but the approach could be more compassionate. The answer is probably B.\n"
