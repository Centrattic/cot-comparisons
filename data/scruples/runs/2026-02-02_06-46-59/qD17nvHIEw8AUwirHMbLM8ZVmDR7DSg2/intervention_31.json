We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. The roommate has a mental health condition, bulimia, which is causing her to binge, and she's using the shared food as a source. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is sharing a living space and cooking meals because they're on a budget. They\u2019re noticing their food is being taken and replaced, which is a privacy and ownership issue. The roommate, on the other hand, is struggling with a serious eating disorder and is on a waitlist for treatment. She's not intentionally stealing; it's a compulsion she can't control.\n\nThe author confronted her, and the roommate broke down. The author then told her she should buy her own food since her parents support her. The key here is how the author handled the situation. While the author has a right to their belongings, approaching it with anger and not empathy might have been hurtful. Bulimia is a medical condition that isn't something one can just \"control\" through willpower. \n\nThe author's argument is that the roommate should exercise restraint, similar to how they do. But that's different because the roommate's condition makes self-control difficult. The author's response might have been harsh given the context. They didn't offer support or suggest solutions, like maybe setting up a separate food area or discussing meal plans. \n\nHowever, the author did try to be understanding initially but was upset because their personal property was being taken. They have a right to feel that their space and belongings are respected. The conflict arises from the roommate's inability to manage her condition without impacting others. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the balance between their right to their belongings and the roommate's mental health challenges. The author's approach could be seen as lacking empathy, which might make them at least partially at fault. But the roommate's actions are also problematic. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid points, but the author's handling of the confrontation might be the main issue here. \n\nHmm, but the user asked if the author is in the wrong. I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had the right to address the issue. However, their delivery could have been more compassionate. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not just if they could have done better. Since they confronted the roommate and expressed their feelings, even if harshly, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. The roommate's actions are the root problem. So maybe answer B.\n"
