We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food without permission. The author confronts her, and the roommate explains her condition. The author's response is that they don't think they did anything wrong and that the roommate should control herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder, and people with it often struggle with control over their eating behaviors. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so she's seeking help but hasn't received it yet. The author is frustrated because their food is being taken and replaced, which is a violation of trust and privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a shared living space, and while it's their food, the roommate's illness is affecting that. The author's reaction is to tell the roommate to buy her own food since she's supported by her parents. But the roommate might not have the resources or be aware of how to manage her condition without taking others' food. \n\nThe author's approach might come off as harsh. Instead of providing support or suggesting solutions (like buying her own food together, or setting boundaries in a compassionate way), the author took a confrontational stance. This could have made the roommate feel isolated, worsening her mental health. \n\nHowever, the author has the right to own their belongings and be respected. The roommate's actions are indeed wrong, regardless of her condition. The author might not be in the wrong for standing up for their belongings but could have handled the confrontation more sensitively. \n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's food was being taken without consent, which is a violation, the author has a right to address it. However, the way they addressed it\u2014by not showing empathy and expecting the roommate to control herself without support\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her health struggles. \n\nThe line between standing up for oneself and being compassionate is thin here. The author's initial approach might have been too harsh, but the roommate's actions were also wrong. So, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because the roommate was taking their food, but the author could have handled it better. But according to the options, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), that would be because the roommate's actions were wrong. But if the author's response was too harsh without considering the roommate's condition, then maybe A. Hmm.\n"
