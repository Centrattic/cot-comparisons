We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author shares a room with a roommate who has bulimia. The roommate is taking the author's food without permission, even replacing it with different products. The author confronts her, leading to an emotional response from the roommate. The author feels justified in asking her to control herself, especially since the roommate is being supported by her parents and could buy her own food.\n\nNow, considering the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that affects self-control. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which indicates she's seeking help but might be struggling with control. The author's frustration is understandable because their personal property is being taken without consent, but the roommate's mental health complicates things.\n\nThe author's approach was direct and maybe a bit harsh. Confronting someone about an eating disorder in a public or emotional setting might not be the best way to handle it. The author's response, while firm, might not have been empathetic enough. However, the author is also within their rights to protect their belongings. The roommate's actions are a violation of boundaries, regardless of her condition.\n\nThe key points here are the boundaries of personal property versus the roommate's mental health. The author isn't wrong for standing up for their own food, but the way they handled it could have been more compassionate. The roommate should be encouraged to seek help, but the author's main issue is about their own belongings being taken without permission. The author's statement about expecting restraint is valid, but the situation requires a balance between empathy and personal boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a right to control their own property. However, the way they handled the confrontation might have been lacking in empathy. The roommate's mental health is a factor, but that doesn't excuse taking others' belongings. The author's frustration is justified, but a more supportive approach could have been better. The answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in how the situation was addressed.\n"
