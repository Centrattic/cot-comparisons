We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. \n\nFirst, the roommate has an eating disorder, which is serious. She told the author she's bulimic and on a waitlist for treatment. She's been taking the author's food and replacing it with different products, which the author found out and confronted her about.\n\nThe author is upset that their food is being taken without permission, even if it's being replaced. They argue that it's not acceptable to take someone else's property regardless of the situation. The roommate, on the other hand, is struggling with a mental health condition that's causing her to act this way.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're in a shared living space but they pay for the food themselves. They feel their control over their belongings is being violated. The roommate's actions are involuntary due to her condition, but the author is within her rights to expect privacy and not have her things taken. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of empathy. The roommate is dealing with a serious issue, and the confrontation might have been harsh. The author called her out in a way that made the roommate cry and now they're not speaking. However, the author also tried to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The roommate's parents support her financially, so maybe she can buy her own food, as the author suggested.\n\nIs the author wrong for enforcing their boundaries? The roommate's behavior is harmful and shouldn't be excused, but the author might have handled it more compassionately. However, the author isn't obligated to enable the roommate's disorder by not setting limits. \n\nThe key points are: the roommate's mental health issue, the author's right to control their belongings, and the approach taken in the confrontation. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking the roommate to control herself. They have a right to their own food and can set boundaries. However, the way they confronted her was probably harsh, but given the situation, they aren't the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
