We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, the roommate has a known eating disorder. Bulimia involves cycles of bingeing and purging, which can be a serious mental health issue. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's aware of the problem but hasn't received professional help yet. \n\nThe author noticed food being taken and replaced, which they found unsettling. They confronted the roommate, who broke down crying and explained her condition. The author then expressed frustration, telling her that they don't want to be her problem and that she should buy her own food. The roommate was upset, and they haven't spoken since.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author is on a budget and cooks for themselves, which is understandable. However, they might not have realized the depth of the roommate's issue. Confronting someone with a mental health condition can be tricky. The author's reaction\u2014while perhaps justified in being upset\u2014might have been harsh. They told the roommate it's not their problem and suggested she should have the same restraint as the author. That could be seen as dismissive of the roommate's struggle, even if the author tried to be understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate is taking someone else's food, which is a violation of trust and boundaries. The author has a right to feel angry about their property being taken, regardless of the roommate's mental health. However, the way the author handled the confrontation might have been unkind. They could have approached it with more empathy, perhaps offering support or suggesting alternatives like meal-sharing or helping the roommate find resources, instead of cutting the roommate off emotionally.\n\nThe key point is whether the author's approach was compassionate or not. While they acknowledged the roommate's problem, their response focused on personal responsibility without considering the roommate's inability to control her impulses due to her condition. The roommate is in a vulnerable state, and the author's public confrontation (even if well-intentioned) might have exacerbated her feelings of shame and isolation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the roommate's actions are problematic, the author's handling of the situation could be seen as lacking empathy. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for how they addressed the issue, but not entirely wrong given the violation of trust.\n"
