We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with different items. The author confronts her, leading to an emotional breakdown. The author argues that they have the right to expect their roommate to control herself, especially since the roommate isn't in a situation where they can't afford food. The roommate's parents support her financially, so the author is frustrated about the food being taken even though it's replaced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can lead to compulsive behaviors. People with bulimia often feel ashamed and might struggle to control their impulses. The roommate did apologize and mentioned being on a waitlist for treatment, which implies she's aware of her problem but can't get immediate help.\n\nThe author's response was to tell the roommate to buy her own food since her parents support her. The author also compared the situation to stealing at the grocery store or in restaurants, which is a valid point about personal property. However, the roommate's actions are driven by a mental health issue, not theft. It's a complex situation where the author's right to their property must be balanced with the roommate's health struggles.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They're cooking on a budget and have a right to expect their belongings to be respected. But the roommate's behavior isn't just about greed; it's a compulsion related to her disorder. The author's approach was direct and firm, which might have been necessary, but it's also harsh given the roommate's mental state.\n\nI should consider whether the author's actions were reasonable. They confronted the roommate, who then broke down, and they haven't spoken since. The author might not be the asshole here because they're standing up for their rights, but there's also a lack of empathy for the roommate's condition. However, expecting someone with a mental illness to control themselves completely without any support is unrealistic. The author could have offered more support or suggested solutions, like helping the roommate find affordable food options or encouraging her to seek help.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong for standing up for their property, but their approach could have been more compassionate. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong,\" and based on the information, they might not be the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
