We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (F20) is living with a roommate (F20) who has bulimia. The roommate has been taking the author's food and replacing it with different products. The author confronted her, and the roommate broke down and explained her condition. The author then told her that it's not acceptable to take their food, even if she has a problem, and that she should buy her own since her parents support her. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder, and people with it often struggle with control over their eating behaviors. The roommate mentioned being on a waitlist for treatment, which suggests she's seeking help but hasn't received it yet. The author is asking her to control herself, but given her condition, is that reasonable?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is paying for their own food with their own money. They cook meals every day and have a budget. The roommate is taking the author's food without permission, which is a violation of personal boundaries. The author is right to be upset about someone taking their property, even if the roommate has a health issue. However, the way the author handled the confrontation might have been harsh.\n\nWhen the author confronted the roommate, she cried and apologized. The author responded by saying it's not their problem and told her to buy her own food. The author also compared the situation to stealing in public places, which might not be fair because the roommate is in a state of mental illness. The author's response could have been more compassionate. Instead of just telling her to buy her own food, maybe the author could have suggested alternative solutions, like helping her find resources or discussing how to set boundaries.\n\nThe roommate might feel isolated and ashamed, so the author's approach of directly calling her out without empathy could have worsened the situation. However, the author's concern about their own belongings and safety is valid. They have the right to expect their food not to be taken. The key issue is whether the author handled the situation with enough understanding given the roommate's condition.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: The roommate has a mental health issue that's affecting her behavior, which the author is aware of. The author is justified in wanting their food not to be taken but could have approached the situation more empathetically and collaboratively. The author's response might have been too harsh, leading to the roommate's emotional distress. That suggests the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the roommate's condition when addressing the issue. However, the act of taking someone's food without consent is inherently wrong, so there's a valid point there too.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. Since the roommate has a known issue, the author could have been more understanding and found a solution together, like setting up a shared food plan or encouraging the roommate to seek help. The author's response was more about blame and less about problem-solving, which might make them the asshole in this situation.\n"
