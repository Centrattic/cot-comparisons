We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe roommate has bulimia, which is a serious eating disorder. The author caught her taking food from their shared space, even replacing it sometimes with different products. When confronted, the roommate admitted to struggling with her condition and being on a waitlist for treatment. The author expressed frustration, pointing out that the roommate could buy her own food since her parents support her. They also compared it to not taking food from a grocery store or restaurant, implying that it's not socially acceptable to take others' belongings regardless of the situation.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they're cooking on a budget, using shared spaces, and their food is being taken without consent. They feel it's unreasonable to expect them to accept their roommate's lack of control, especially when there's an easy alternative (buying her own food). The author also acknowledges the roommate's mental health issue but believes personal responsibility is still important.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate is in a vulnerable state, dealing with a disorder that's affecting her behavior. She's apologized and tried to replace the food, showing some awareness. The author's confrontation led to emotional distress for the roommate, which could be seen as harsh given the mental health aspect.\n\nMental health disorders can impair self-control, and bulimia involves cycles of binging and purging. The roommate might not have full control over her actions, even if she intellectually knows it's wrong. The author's approach was direct and possibly dismissive of the roommate's struggle. However, the roommate's actions do violate the shared living space norms, and the author has a right to set boundaries regarding their property.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between empathy for the roommate's condition and the author's right to their belongings. The author could have approached the situation with more compassion, perhaps suggesting solutions like meal planning or temporary help while the roommate awaits treatment. Confronting her in a way that's accusatory and dismissive of her emotional state might not be the best approach, especially given the severity of her condition.\n\nHowever, the author isn't entirely wrong in asserting their right to their property. The line here is whether the roommate's mental health issue absolves her of responsibility. Since the author is paying for their own food and the roommate has financial support, the expectation is that the roommate should manage her own meals. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they expressed it might have been hurtful.\n\nIn summary, the author has a legitimate grievance about their food being taken, but the manner of confronting the roommate and the lack of empathy could make them the asshole. The best answer might be A (Yes), considering the importance of mental health and the need for a more compassionate approach. However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. The author's right to their property is important, but so is supporting a roommate with a serious disorder. The answer might depend on whether the author's approach was overly harsh given the context.\n"
