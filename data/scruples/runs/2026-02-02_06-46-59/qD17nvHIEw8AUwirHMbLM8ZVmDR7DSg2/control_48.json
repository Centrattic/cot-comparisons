We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia who is taking the author's food without permission, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author, a 20-year-old female, shares a home with another 20-year-old female. The roommate has a bulimia issue and is taking the author's food, replacing it with different products. The author confronts her, and the roommate breaks down, explaining her condition. The author then tells the roommate that she can't take her food, even if she replaces it, because it's not acceptable to take others' property regardless of the reason.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: She's within her rights to expect privacy and ownership over her personal property. Food is a basic necessity, but in this case, the author is cooking for herself and the roommate isn't contributing. The roommate is taking without permission, which is a violation. The author has a right to be upset about her belongings being taken, especially if she's on a budget and working hard to support herself.\n\nOn the roommate's side: She's dealing with a serious eating disorder, which is a mental health issue. Bulimia can lead to compulsive behaviors. She's on a waitlist for treatment, indicating she's seeking help. The fact that she's replacing the food shows some effort to make amends. However, this doesn't excuse the action of taking without permission. People with mental health issues still have a responsibility to respect others' property, even if they struggle with control.\n\nThe author's response was confrontational but direct. She acknowledged the roommate's problem but set a boundary. It's reasonable to expect someone to respect your property, even if they have an illness. However, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps offering support or suggesting solutions, like buying her own food. But the act of taking without permission is still wrong, regardless of the reason.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The roommate took the food, which is theft. The author has every right to ask for it to stop. However, the way she addressed it might have been harsh, especially considering the roommate's mental health. But the core issue is about respecting belongings. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her own property. The roommate's actions are the main issue here. The author's response, while perhaps lacking in empathy, is justified in terms of boundaries. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
