We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let's see. The roommate is bulimic and has been taking the author's food, replacing it with different or unopened items. The author confronted her, and the roommate broke down. The author then told her that they can't be responsible for this and that she should buy her own food since her parents support her. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Well, the roommate has a mental health condition\u2014bulimia is an eating disorder, which is a serious issue. It affects her behavior, and she's on a waitlist for treatment. The author is upset because their stuff is being taken without consent. But the roommate is struggling with a disorder that impairs her self-control. \n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to their belongings and to have their boundaries respected. Taking someone's food without permission is wrong regardless of the reason. The author is handling their own budget and cooking, so they're being responsible. But on the other hand, the roommate is in a vulnerable state, and the author's response might have been harsh. Telling her to buy her own food when she's struggling with an eating disorder could be dismissive of her mental health. \n\nHowever, the author is also within their rights to set boundaries. They didn't attack the roommate's condition but instead held her accountable. The roommate's actions are still a boundary violation. The problem is that the author might not have considered the roommate's mental health struggles when setting those boundaries. Maybe a more compassionate approach could have been taken, like discussing it without being confrontational, offering support, or involving someone else like a professional. \n\nBut the author was direct and firm, which is understandable. They are not the one with the disorder; they have the right to protect their property. The roommate needs to seek help, but that's her responsibility. The author isn't obligated to enable her behavior. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's actions were a response to being violated. They confronted the roommate and set a boundary. While the approach could have been softer, the core issue is about respecting personal property. The author isn't wrong for wanting their things to be respected. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n"
