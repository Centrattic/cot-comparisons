We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a 20-year-old who's living with a roommate who has bulimia. The roommate is taking the author's food, replacing it with different products, and the author confronts her. The roommate breaks down crying and explains her condition, but the author responds by telling her to buy her own food since her parents support her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which is a serious condition. She's on a waitlist for treatment, so she's already seeking help. Her behavior is a symptom of her illness, not just a matter of willpower. The author is upset about their food being taken, which is understandable because it's their property. But the way the author handled the confrontation might be problematic.\n\nThe author's response was to tell the roommate that she can just buy her own food, which is a bit dismissive of the roommate's mental health struggle. While it's true that stealing is not acceptable, the roommate isn't choosing to act this way; her illness is driving the behavior. The author might not realize how difficult it is for someone with bulimia to control their impulses. The author's comparison to stealing at a grocery store or restaurants isn't quite the same because those are public spaces with different social norms, whereas the roommate is in a shared living situation where boundaries might be more blurred.\n\nHowever, the author's right to privacy and ownership of their own food is valid. It's not unreasonable to expect that someone shouldn't take another person's belongings. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they're cooking on a budget and can't afford to lose food. The key here is whether the author considered the roommate's mental health in their response. Instead of being confrontational and telling her to buy her own food, maybe a more compassionate approach could have been taken, like discussing solutions together, such as setting up a shared food space or agreeing on boundaries.\n\nThe roommate's behavior is harmful to her health and likely causes guilt and shame, which is part of the eating disorder. The author's response might have exacerbated the roommate's distress. It's possible that the author didn't handle the situation with enough empathy, but does that make them the asshole? The author did confront the roommate, which is necessary to address the issue, but the way they did it was harsh. The expectation that the roommate should control herself might not be realistic given her condition. \n\nSo, considering the roommate's mental health and the fact that her behavior is an illness, the author's approach could be seen as lacking compassion. However, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have a right to their property. It's a tricky balance. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they addressed the issue, but the method could have been more empathetic. Alternatively, the author's reaction might be seen as dismissive of the roommate's struggles, making them at least partially in the wrong. \n\nIn the end, the decision might hinge on whether the author's response was reasonable given the roommate's circumstances. Since the roommate is actively seeking treatment and the author's response was harsh, maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the author's main point is about respecting property and the roommate's actions are indeed stealing, then the author isn't entirely wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue the opposite.\n"
