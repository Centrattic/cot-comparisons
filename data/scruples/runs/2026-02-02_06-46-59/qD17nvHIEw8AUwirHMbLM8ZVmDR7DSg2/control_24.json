We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is a 20-year-old living with a roommate who has bulimia. The roommate is taking the author's food, even though she replaces it with different products. The author confronted her, and the roommate broke down crying. The author feels that the roommate should control herself and that taking someone else's food isn't acceptable, even with her eating disorder. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The roommate has a mental health issue that's affecting her behavior. Bulimia is a serious condition that can be hard to control, and the roommate is on a waitlist for treatment. She's trying to manage it but is struggling. The author is in a difficult situation because their food is being taken without consent, which is a violation of personal property.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being direct about their feelings. They set boundaries, which is important. They might not be wrong in expressing that they are uncomfortable with their food being taken, especially if it's affecting their own budget and well-being. However, the way they handled the confrontation might be part of the issue. The roommate was very upset, and the author's response was firm, suggesting that the roommate should just buy her own food. That could come off as insensitive, especially considering the roommate's mental health struggles.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't necessarily responsible for the roommate's condition. It's reasonable to expect that someone can't take others' belongings, regardless of their issues. The roommate's actions are a problem, and the author is within their rights to ask for their space and property to be respected. However, the author might need to consider more compassionate ways to address the issue, like suggesting alternative solutions or encouraging treatment, rather than just being confrontational.\n\nThe key points here are about setting boundaries vs. being empathetic. The author isn't wrong for wanting their food to be respected, but maybe they could have handled the conversation more sensitively. The roommate's mental health is a factor, but the author isn't responsible for treating her condition. It's a balance between accountability and empathy. The question is whether the author's approach crossed the line into being the asshole. The author's statement that they feel bad but don't think they did anything wrong suggests they are trying to balance both, but the outcome of the confrontation (roommate crying and avoiding) might indicate that the approach wasn't the best. Still, it's hard to say the author is entirely in the wrong. They have the right to their belongings, and the roommate's actions are the main issue here.\n"
