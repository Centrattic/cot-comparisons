We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with a roommate who has bulimia and is stealing their food. The author confronted the roommate, who then broke down crying and explained her condition. The author is now questioning if they were too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the roommate has a mental health issue and is struggling with an eating disorder. Bulimia can involve loss of control around eating, so taking someone else's food might be an impulse she can't control. She also mentions she replaces the food, which suggests she's trying to be responsible but can't help herself. The author's frustration is understandable because they paid for the food and it's their property.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their own belongings. They cook for themselves and can't afford to eat out, so the stolen food is a financial burden. The author's approach was to confront the roommate, which they did in a moment of anger. But the roommate was already in a vulnerable state, and the author's response might have been harsh, especially considering the roommate's mental health struggle.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The roommate has a known, albeit unaddressed, mental health issue. 2) The author's confrontation led to the roommate crying and they haven't spoken since. 3) The author is trying to be nice now but is still upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were justified. While the author is within their rights to expect their property to be respected, the way they handled the confrontation might have been insensitive given the roommate's condition. The author could have found a more supportive way to address the issue, perhaps suggesting alternatives like seeking immediate help or finding a compromise to manage the situation without confrontation. \n\nHowever, the roommate's actions do cross a line by taking someone else's property, which is generally not acceptable regardless of the reason. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries, but the method of confronting the issue could have been more empathetic. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the roommate's actions are a result of a disorder, the author's blame might not be entirely fair. The author should consider that the roommate needs support rather than judgment. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong, but the approach could be improved. However, the answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). Considering that the author's actions, while perhaps harsh, are about protecting their property and they were upfront about the issue, maybe the answer is B. But if the author's approach was unreasonably harsh given the roommate's condition, then A. It's a tough call.\n"
