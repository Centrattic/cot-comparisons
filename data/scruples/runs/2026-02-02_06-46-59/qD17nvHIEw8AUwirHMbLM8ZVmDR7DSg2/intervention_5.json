We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a roommate with bulimia taking the author's food. The author confronted her, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The roommate has a mental health issue, bulimia, which is serious. Taking someone else's food isn't okay, but the roommate is struggling with a disorder. The author is trying to set boundaries because their food is being taken without consent. \n\nThe author's main argument is about expectations of self-control. They mention that they cook a lot on a budget, so the food is important. They confronted the roommate, who admitted to the issue but is on a waitlist for treatment. The author is upset that the roommate isn't controlling herself, even though they understand the disorder.\n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently. Instead of being confrontational and making the roommate feel bad, maybe setting boundaries in a more supportive way. For example, offering to buy separate portions or using a different container for their own food. The author did apologize and tried to be nice after, but the initial confrontation might have been too harsh given the roommate's mental health.\n\nAlso, the roommate is clearly distressed. The author's response might have exacerbated the situation. While it's reasonable to want your food not taken, the approach taken might not have considered the roommate's condition adequately. The author's statement about the roommate's parents supporting her could come off as dismissive, implying she should be able to buy her own food, which might not be feasible emotionally or financially for someone with an eating disorder.\n\nSo, considering the roommate's mental health and the author's approach, maybe the author is in the wrong. They might need to balance their own needs with empathy. But it's a tough spot. However, the key here is how the confrontation was handled and whether the author considered the roommate's situation. The answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the way they addressed the issue without providing support.\n"
