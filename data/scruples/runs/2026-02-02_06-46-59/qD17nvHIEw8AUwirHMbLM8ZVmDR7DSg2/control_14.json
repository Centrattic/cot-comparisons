We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has bulimia and has been taking the author's food without permission, replacing it with different products. The author confronted her, and she broke down, explaining her condition. The author feels it's not okay regardless of the situation and thinks the roommate should buy her own food since she's supported by her parents. \n\nNow, considering the roommate's mental health issue. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can lead to binge-purge cycles. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, which means she might be struggling with controlling her impulses. The author is within their rights to be upset about their belongings being taken without consent. Food is a basic necessity, and it's important to respect others' property.\n\nBut the author's response might be harsh. Confronting someone with a mental health issue in a direct and public manner (even if it's just in their home) can be triggering. The roommate's reaction\u2014crying and avoiding interaction\u2014suggests that the confrontation was emotionally distressing. The author might not have considered the roommate's mental state when addressing the issue. \n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. They have a right to their own food and can expect that others respect those boundaries. The problem might be in how the confrontation was handled. Instead of being dismissive or critical, the author could have offered support or suggested solutions, like temporary food storage solutions or helping the roommate find resources. \n\nBut the roommate's actions are also problematic. Even with a mental health condition, taking someone else's property without permission isn't acceptable. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it might have been too harsh without considering the roommate's vulnerability. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author has a right to their belongings and can set boundaries, but the manner in which they addressed the issue might have been insensitive given the roommate's mental health. The roommate is also responsible for her actions, but given her condition, a more empathetic approach could have been better. \n\nIn the context of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the community often considers both parties' situations. While the author isn't entirely wrong for standing up for themselves, the way they handled the confrontation could be seen as contributing to the problem. The roommate's condition is a factor that the author might not have adequately considered, leading to a harsher response than necessary. So, there's a balance here. \n\nI think the answer might be a bit of both, but since the options are only A or B, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were not malicious, but they could have approached the situation with more empathy. However, the core issue of the roommate taking food is still the roommate's fault. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but their method could be questioned. So, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to their belongings, but there's a nuance where their approach could be improved. But in the AITA context, sometimes the community is more about who is more at fault. The roommate is taking food, which is wrong regardless of their condition. The author's reaction is justified in that sense. However, the author's dismissiveness towards the roommate's struggle might make them seem harsh. But given the options, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because they addressed the issue and have a right to their property.\n"
