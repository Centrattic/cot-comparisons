We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. The situation is a bit complex because it involves a roommate's mental health issue.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a bulimia problem and is on a waitlist for treatment. She takes the author's food, replaces it, but the author is upset about their belongings being used without consent. The author confronted her, and while they apologized, the roommate was upset, and now there's tension.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author act inconsiderately by not being more empathetic, considering the roommate's mental health? Or is the author justified in asking her to control herself, especially since they cook on a budget and the food is their property?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their own food and belongings. It's true that taking someone's property without permission is wrong, regardless of the reason. The author is on a budget and works hard to provide meals, so having their food taken without consent could be frustrating. The author's reaction might be seen as standing up for their own needs and boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the roommate has a serious mental health issue. Bulimia is a disorder that can make self-control extremely difficult. The roommate isn't stealing for pleasure or convenience; it's a compulsion related to an eating disorder. The author's approach might come off as dismissive of the roommate's struggles. Even though the author didn't blame her for the condition, the message was that it's her responsibility to control herself now, which might not be realistic given her current state.\n\nAlso, the author's suggestion that she should buy her own food might be valid since the roommate's parents support her financially. But the emotional impact of the confrontation could have been harsh. The roommate broke down crying, and their relationship has become strained. The author might have handled it more compassionately, perhaps offering to help her find immediate support or resources while still setting boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their frustration. However, the approach could have been more empathetic. The roommate's actions are harmful, but so is the breakdown in their relationship now. The question is whether the author's response was reasonable. \n\nConsidering that the roommate has a disorder that affects self-control and the author is asking for restraint that's hard for the roommate to achieve, maybe the author should have been more understanding but still set boundaries. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room to argue that they could have handled it better. However, the core issue of the roommate taking food without permission is a valid concern. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that empathy could have been improved.\n"
