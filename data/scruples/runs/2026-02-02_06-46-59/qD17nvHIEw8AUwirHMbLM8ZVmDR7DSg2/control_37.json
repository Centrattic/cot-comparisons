We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking food. The situation is that the roommate has a bulimic disorder and can't control herself from taking the author's food. The author confronts her, and the roommate breaks down. The author then tells her to buy her own food since her parents support her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roommate's mental health issue. Bulimia is a serious eating disorder that can be difficult to manage without treatment. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so she's not getting immediate help. The author is upset about the food being taken and the replacement, which is understandable because it's their property.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they have a right to their own food and that the roommate should control herself. They compare it to not taking others' food in public places. But the key difference here is that the roommate is in a private living space where they're sharing a household. The roommate's eating disorder is leading to this behavior, which isn't a simple matter of willpower. People with eating disorders often struggle with compulsive behaviors that they can't control, regardless of understanding it's wrong.\n\nThe author confronts the roommate directly, which might have been necessary to address the issue, but the way they did it could have been more empathetic. Telling her that her parents support her and she should just buy her own food might come off as dismissive of her struggle. It's possible that the author didn't fully consider the roommate's mental health when making their demands.\n\nHowever, the author is also within their rights to expect their property to be respected. They are covering the cost of the food, so it's reasonable to want to set boundaries. The challenge is balancing the roommate's health issues with the author's needs.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong for standing up for themselves. But there's a nuance here about understanding the roommate's condition. The author's response was firm but perhaps lacked the compassion needed given the roommate's mental health. Still, they did acknowledge the roommate's problem and are trying to be nice afterward. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but their approach could have been more compassionate. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the roommate's actions are due to a mental health issue and the author's response might have been harsher than necessary, there's a case that the author could have handled it differently. But given the information, the author's main issue was defending their own property, which is a valid concern. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a middle ground. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to their food and set boundaries, even if the approach could be improved. The roommate's condition is a factor, but the author isn't responsible for managing that. The key is that the author is asserting their own needs, which is reasonable.\n"
