We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their bulimic roommate to control herself. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the roommate has a bulimic issue and has been taking the author's food, replacing it sometimes with different products. The author confronts her, and the roommate breaks down, explaining her condition and being on a waitlist for treatment. The author responds by saying it's not their problem and that the roommate should buy her own food since she's supported by her parents. The author also compares it to not taking food at a grocery store or restaurant, implying that it's not acceptable regardless of the reason.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the roommate has a mental health issue that's affecting their behavior. Bulimia is a serious condition that can be hard to control, especially without proper treatment. The fact that she's on a waitlist suggests she's trying to get help but isn't getting immediate support. The author's approach might come off as dismissive, even if they tried to be understanding. Telling her it's not their problem and that she should buy her own food could feel shaming, especially when she's already struggling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is paying for their own groceries and has a right to privacy and control over their belongings. The roommate's actions are indeed taking the author's property without consent. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they handled the confrontation might not be the most supportive. Instead of making it about the roommate's responsibility to buy their own food, maybe suggesting alternatives like helping her find immediate help or setting boundaries that respect both parties' needs could have been better.\n\nThe key here is balancing empathy with the right to personal property. The author isn't entirely wrong for standing up for their belongings, but their response might lack the necessary support for the roommate's situation. It's possible the author could have approached the conversation with more compassion, acknowledging the roommate's struggle while still setting clear boundaries. However, the roommate's actions are still a violation, so the author isn't completely at fault either.\n\nGiven that, the answer might be a bit nuanced, but based on the options provided (A for yes, B for no), I think the author is not entirely in the wrong, but perhaps could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they confronted the roommate about taking their food and set boundaries, which is reasonable, but the way they did it might have been harsh. But the core issue is the unauthorized taking of food. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to expect their belongings to be respected. However, the harshness of the response might be seen as contributing to the problem. But given the options, the answer is likely B.\n"
