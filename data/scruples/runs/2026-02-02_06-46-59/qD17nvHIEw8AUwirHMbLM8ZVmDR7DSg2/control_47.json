We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The roommate has an eating disorder, specifically bulimia, which is causing her to take the author's food. The author is upset because they cook meals and the roommate is not only taking the food but also replacing it with different products. The author confronted the roommate, who admitted to the issue and cried, mentioning she's on a waitlist for treatment. The author then told her that it's not their problem and that the roommate should buy her own food. \n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries, mental health, and social norms. The author is in a shared living space but has a clear boundary regarding their food. They are on a budget and cooking for themselves, which is important. The roommate's actions are a result of her health issue, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's response was to confront her, which might be seen as necessary in some ways, but how they handled it could be problematic. The roommate is already struggling with a disorder, and the author's reaction might have exacerbated her stress. The author's comment about the roommate's parents supporting her and thus being able to buy her own food might come off as insensitive, especially if the roommate is in a vulnerable state.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. It's reasonable to expect roommates to respect each other's property, including food. The roommate's behavior is not appropriate regardless of her condition. The author is trying to maintain their own space and resources, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the way the confrontation happened might not have been the most supportive approach. The author could have tried to find a solution together, like setting up separate food storage or encouraging the roommate to seek help. The author did acknowledge the roommate's mental health issue but still felt justified in their stance. \n\nThe roommate's bulimia is a medical issue that requires treatment. The author's expectation that the roommate should control herself might be unrealistic if she's not receiving treatment. The author might need to consider that the roommate's actions are not entirely within her control, given her condition. \n\nBut at the same time, the author has a right to expect their belongings to be respected. The roommate's actions are still taking the author's food without consent, which is an issue of personal property. The author is not responsible for the roommate's health issues, and it's reasonable to set boundaries.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's not acceptable to take someone else's food regardless of the reason. The author might not be the asshole here because they are standing up for their own needs and boundaries. However, the approach could have been more empathetic. The author's comment about the roommate's parents might come off as dismissive, which could have hurt the roommate more than necessary.\n\nOverall, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries and confronting the issue. They have a valid concern about their property and the need for respect. However, the method of confrontation could have been more compassionate, but that doesn't necessarily make the author the asshole. The roommate's actions are still the problem, and the author is justified in addressing them.\n"
