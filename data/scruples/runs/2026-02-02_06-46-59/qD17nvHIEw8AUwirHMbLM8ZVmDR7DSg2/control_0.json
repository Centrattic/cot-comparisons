We\u2019ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she\u2019s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren\u2019t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.\n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can\u2019t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn\u2019t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.\n\n\nLately though, it\u2019s been getting much worse and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I\u2019ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I\u2019ve already opened.\n\n\nLast week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she\u2019s been bulimic for a wrong time, she knows it\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t help binging on my food sometimes, blah blah. Also that she doesn\u2019t want to be like this but she\u2019s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was very upset and apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I\u2019m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn\u2019t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there\u2019s something wrong with her but it\u2019s not like she can\u2019t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people\u2019s tables. I told her that and I don\u2019t understand why this is any different; it\u2019s not socially acceptable to take other people\u2019s property regardless of what\u2019s wrong with you. \n\n\nShe cried in her room for a long time and we haven\u2019t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I\u2019m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don\u2019t think I actually did anything wrong. We\u2019re both 20, IMO it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don\u2019t because I know better. I\u2019m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for confronting their bulimic roommate about taking their food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation: the roommate has a known eating disorder (bulimia), which is a serious mental health issue. The roommate is on a waitlist for treatment, so she's actively seeking help but hasn't received it yet. The author cooks a lot of meals at home due to budget constraints and has noticed their food being taken and sometimes replaced with different products. The author confronted the roommate, leading to the roommate breaking down in tears and explaining her condition. The author then expressed frustration, stating that the roommate's parents support her financially and should buy her own food instead of taking theirs. The author also compared it to taking food from a store or another person's table, implying it's socially unacceptable regardless of the mental health issue.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author was wrong. On one hand, the author has a right to their own food and property. It's reasonable to expect others not to take things without permission. The author is supporting themselves on a budget, so this is a financial issue as well. On the other hand, the roommate has a mental health condition that's affecting her ability to control her behavior. Bulimia can involve compulsive behaviors that are hard to resist without treatment. The author's response was firm, pointing out that the roommate's parents can support her, which might be harsh given the roommate's vulnerability. The author might not have considered the complexity of the eating disorder and the difficulty of managing it without access to treatment.\n\nHowever, the author also tried to be understanding initially, noting that they feel bad but still believe they're not in the wrong. The key point is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. While the roommate's behavior is problematic, the author's response might have been too harsh, especially since the roommate was already in a vulnerable state. The author could have handled it more compassionately, perhaps by discussing alternatives or setting boundaries in a more supportive way. But the author's core point\u2014expecting others to respect their property\u2014is valid. The conflict arises from the intersection of the roommate's mental health and the author's right to control their belongings.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, it's generally agreed that taking others' property without consent is wrong. The author isn't wrong for holding the roommate accountable for that. However, the lack of empathy in the confrontation might have contributed to the roommate's distress. The author's comparison to taking food in public places is a valid point, as it's indeed unacceptable regardless of the reason. But mental health issues can impair judgment, so the author might need to balance accountability with understanding. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is within their rights to expect their food not to be taken, how they communicated this could be seen as harsh. The roommate's mental health is a factor that might require a more compassionate approach. However, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the action of taking food without permission is indeed a violation. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that a more empathetic approach might have been better.\n"
