We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because they have a policy that requires appointments for women, and their staff isn't trained or comfortable with women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if they have a policy, if it's preventing a transgender or non-binary person from getting services, it might be illegal. The business is Muslim, and their policy is based on religious beliefs, but anti-discrimination laws often protect against this kind of situation. For example, in the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act might apply here if the business has 15+ employees. Plus, some states have laws against gender-based discrimination in public accommodations.\n\nThen, there's the ethical side. The business is stating they serve everyone, but their policy effectively excludes women unless they book an appointment. The customer identified as male-passing and wanted a men's cut, which might not fall under the same category as a woman's haircut. The business might be enforcing a policy that's not necessary for all women, especially if the customer doesn't present as a woman. However, the business's reasoning is that their staff isn't trained for women's hair, which could be a legitimate business concern. But if they can accommodate women through appointments, maybe they can make an exception here.\n\nThe staff's comfort and religious beliefs are part of the issue. The business is Muslim, and some employees are strict about not touching women's hair. But if the customer isn't presenting as a woman, does that change things? The customer might not want to book an appointment for a men's cut, which the business insists on for women. This could be seen as discriminatory if they're applying the policy inconsistently.\n\nAlso, the business mentions that the female barber is contracted for appointments. If the customer wanted a men's cut, maybe the female barber isn't necessary. But the business's policy is based on the customer's gender, not the type of service. So if a woman comes in for a men's cut, they still require an appointment. That seems like a policy based on gender, which could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of the customer's reaction, they felt harassed and called the business transphobic. The business might have unintentionally discriminated against a transgender or non-binary person by enforcing a gender-based policy without considering their identity. Even if the customer is male-passing, the policy is gendered, which could lead to discrimination claims.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the business's policy is based on the customer's gender, which could be illegal. They might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not serving someone who doesn't fit their appointment criteria based on gender. The fact that they can't accommodate due to staff training and religious beliefs might not be a valid defense in a legal context. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that results in discrimination.\n"
