We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a barber shop managed by someone who is part of a Muslim group. They have a policy that requires appointments for women and don't train staff on women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut but didn't have an appointment. The author didn't cut her hair because of the policy, leading to accusations of transphobia, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the business has a religious exemption, there might be limits. The customer identifies as a woman but presents as male. However, the business's policy is based on the customer's gender, not their gender identity. The key here is whether the policy is applied based on the customer's gender identity or their perceived gender. If the business is excluding someone based on their gender identity, that could be problematic. But if they're following a policy based on the customer's appearance, it's a bit different. However, the customer's gender identity might not align with the policy's criteria. \n\nAlso, the business states on their website that they serve both men and women but require appointments for women. If the customer is a woman, regardless of how she presents, the policy should apply. But if the business is using perceived gender rather than gender identity, that could lead to inconsistency and discrimination. The customer might argue that she's a woman, so the policy should allow her to get a haircut without an appointment if she's presenting as a man, but the business's policy is based on the appointment system for women. This is a bit of a gray area. \n\nReligious exemptions are a point here. Some jurisdictions allow religious exemptions from certain laws, but anti-discrimination laws might override that, especially if the business is considered a public accommodation. The business's policy might be seen as discriminatory if it's denying service to someone based on gender identity. Even if the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair, the business could arrange for their contracted female stylist to do it with a few hours' notice, as the author mentions. So the author's refusal might be more about the policy rather than the inability to provide service. \n\nThe customer's accusations of being transphobic and sexist could stem from the business's policy not accommodating gender identity. The author's stance might be based on religious beliefs, but if that leads to excluding someone from services simply because of their gender identity, it's a form of discrimination. The fact that they can arrange for a female stylist suggests that the policy could be flexible to accommodate, which might mitigate some of the blame. However, the policy itself is written in a way that could be seen as excluding women, regardless of the reason. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about balancing religious freedom with anti-discrimination principles. The business has the right to their beliefs, but public accommodations typically need to serve all people. Denying service based on gender identity could be unethical, especially when the service can be provided with minimal effort (like an appointment). The author might be in the wrong here because their policy is causing harm to a customer who is part of a marginalized group. The staff's discomfort due to religious reasons is valid, but the business should find a way to provide the service without forcing staff to violate their beliefs, perhaps by using the contracted stylist. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's policy and refusal to make an exception (even though they could have called the female stylist) might be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
