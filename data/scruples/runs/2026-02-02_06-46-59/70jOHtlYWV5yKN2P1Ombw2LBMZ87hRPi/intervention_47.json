We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's Muslim and faces a situation where a male-passing woman came in for a haircut. The shop has a policy that requires women to book appointments because they only have one female barber who's contracted on an as-needed basis. The customer argued that they wanted a men's style, so they thought they could get a regular haircut without an appointment. The staff, including the manager, refused because of religious beliefs and the shop's policies. The customer left upset, accusing them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. The customer is a trans man or a non-binary person who presents as male but identifies as such. If the shop's policy is to serve men without appointments but requires appointments for women, and the customer identifies as male, then the shop might be denying service based on gender identity. That could be illegal, depending on local laws. The shop's reasoning is religious, but exemptions for religion don't always override anti-discrimination laws, especially in public accommodations.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The shop claims they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, but if the customer is presenting as male, maybe the staff isn't comfortable cutting their hair now. However, if the customer's gender identity is male, the shop's policy might not apply, and refusing service could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the customer is within their rights to feel wronged if they believe they were treated unfairly based on their gender identity.\n\nThe shop's policy is clear on their website and signage, which is good, but maybe the policy isn't inclusive enough. If the shop serves trans people and non-binary individuals, their policy needs to account for that. The staff not being trained for women's hair is a business practice, but if they can accommodate by calling the female barber for male-identifying customers, perhaps the policy is too rigid.\n\nThe manager mentions feeling bad but prioritizing employee comfort. However, forcing employees to follow a policy that might be discriminatory is a problem. The shop might need to adjust their policy to be more inclusive, maybe by allowing exceptions for trans customers or providing proper training.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy might be violating anti-discrimination laws, especially if they're denying service to someone who identifies as male based on their appearance. The manager is in the wrong because they didn't adapt their policy to accommodate the customer's identity, leading to a discriminatory outcome. So the answer is A.\n"
