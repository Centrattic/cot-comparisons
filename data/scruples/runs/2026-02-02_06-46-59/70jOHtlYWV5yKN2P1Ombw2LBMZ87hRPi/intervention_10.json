We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's being accused of transphobia and sexism after refusing to cut a male-passing woman's hair. The shop has a policy where women need an appointment because they don't train staff on women's hair due to religious reasons, and they have a female barber on contract.\n\nFirst, the customer was a male-passing woman. They wanted a men's cut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women. The manager explained that they can't cut women's hair unless it's family, which is a religious policy. The customer got upset and left, calling them transphobic, etc.\n\nSo, is the manager in the wrong? Well, the shop clearly states their policy on their website and social media, so the customer should have known. However, the customer identified as a man, so maybe they expected to be treated as such. The shop's policy is based on religion, but they also mention that they serve all customers. But in this case, they couldn't accommodate because their staff isn't trained for women's hair, even if the customer is male-passing.\n\nThe manager did offer to book an appointment, but the customer refused. The shop has a female barber available on contract. The issue is whether refusing service to a transgender man (if that's what they are) is transphobic. But the shop's policy is about gender for the service, not the customer's identity. If the customer is legally male, the policy might still apply based on their current gender. However, if the customer is a trans man, the policy could be seen as discriminatory. The shop's policy might not account for that nuance.\n\nAlso, the staff's comfort due to religious beliefs is a factor. The staff isn't trained for women's hair, so they can't perform the service. But if the customer is a trans man, the policy might be excluding them based on gender identity. The shop's policy might be outdated or not inclusive of trans individuals. \n\nThe manager is caught between religious practices and potential discrimination. But the key point is that the shop is transparent about their policy. However, in many places, refusing service based on gender identity can be illegal. For example, in the U.S., some states protect against discrimination based on gender identity. So the manager might be in the wrong if the policy excludes trans people. But if the shop is explicitly stating their policies and the customer didn't follow them, maybe not. However, the transphobic accusation is about treating trans people differently, which could be an issue here.\n\nI'm leaning towards the manager being in the wrong because the policy might not accommodate trans individuals, leading to discrimination. Even if the shop is transparent, the policy could be excluding people based on their gender identity. The manager's solution was to book an appointment for women, but if the customer is a trans man, they might not be considered a woman, hence the policy's failure. So the answer might be A (wrong), but I need to check if the shop's policy is legally permissible. If the law allows for religious exemptions, then maybe not. However, if gender identity is protected, then the shop is in the wrong. Since the user is in the U.S. (based on context), some states might have protections. Therefore, the manager is in the wrong for not accommodating a trans customer based on outdated gender policies.\n"
