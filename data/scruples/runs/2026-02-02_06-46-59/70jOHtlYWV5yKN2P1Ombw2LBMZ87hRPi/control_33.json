We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the manager of the barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a male-passing woman's hair, given their policy and religious practices. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The barbershop primarily serves men, has a female barber available by appointment, and they mention this policy on their website and social media. The customer in question identified as a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The manager explains that their religious beliefs prevent male employees from cutting women's hair unless it's family, which is why they require appointments for women. The female employee isn't there that day, so they can't serve her, leading to the customer feeling discriminated against.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspects, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the business has a religious exemption, there's a line where accommodating customers is necessary unless it causes undue hardship. The manager mentions that they have a policy in place for women, which requires appointments, but the customer didn't have one. However, the customer is male-passing, which complicates things. If the customer is presenting as male and wants a men's cut, maybe the business shouldn't have an issue. But the manager's employees aren't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, and the female barber isn't available that day. \n\nThe customer felt transphobic and sexist, which are serious accusations. The manager argues that they're following their policy and respecting their employees' beliefs. But the problem is whether refusing service to a transgender or gender non-conforming person is permissible. In many jurisdictions, anti-discrimination laws protect gender identity and expression. The business might be violating those laws by not serving the customer, even if it's due to religious beliefs. \n\nAlso, the manager mentions that they can call in the female barber if given a couple of hours notice. However, the customer didn't have an appointment, but they might be in a situation where they need the service immediately. The manager's refusal without offering an alternative (like rescheduling or explaining the policy clearly) might be seen as discriminatory. \n\nReligious exemptions are tricky. While some places allow businesses to opt out of services for religious reasons, this usually applies to specific services and not general refusal of service to a protected class. If the barbershop is open to the public, they might be required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity, even if it conflicts with their beliefs. \n\nSo, putting this together, the manager might be in the wrong because they refused service to a customer based on gender identity, which could be considered discrimination. The fact that the customer is male-passing adds another layer, as it's possible they're seeking a gender-affirming service, and denying that could be harmful. The business's policy, while stated, might not be sufficient if it leads to discrimination against protected groups. \n\nOn the other hand, the manager is managing employees who have religious objections, which complicates things. But the key here is whether the business is accommodating the customer's needs within their policies. If they could arrange for the female barber, maybe they should have done so, even if it required rescheduling. However, the customer didn't have an appointment, and the female barber wasn't available that day. It's a conflict between religious practices and legal obligations. \n\nIn many cases, businesses can't refuse service to transgender individuals even if it causes discomfort among employees. The manager might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not trying to accommodate the customer, especially if the female barber could be called in with notice. The manager's stance that employees shouldn't cut women's hair due to religion might not hold up against the legal requirement to serve all customers without discrimination. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because they discriminated based on gender identity, even if it's unintentional. However, I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like specific laws in the area mentioned. Since the user didn't specify the country, but assuming a place like the US, where Title VII and similar laws protect against discrimination based on gender identity. So yes, A would be the answer.\n"
