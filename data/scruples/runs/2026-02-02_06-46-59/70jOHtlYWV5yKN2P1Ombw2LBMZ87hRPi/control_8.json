We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men and has a policy requiring appointments for women so they can be served by the contracted female stylist. A customer who identifies as a male-passing woman came in without an appointment, wanting a men's cut. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons, leading to a conflict where the customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, the policy is clear: appointments for women to ensure the female stylist is available. The shop's stance is based on their religious beliefs, which prohibit male employees from touching women's hair except for family members. The employee in question here isn't a woman, but the customer's gender presentation complicates things. The staff's discomfort stems from both religious rules and lack of training in women's haircuts.\n\nThe key points here are the policy's clarity and the reasons behind it. The shop made their policies public on their website and signage, so the customer should have known about the appointment requirement. The manager tried to explain that the policy is in place to respect employees' religious beliefs and to provide proper service. However, the customer felt discriminated against, leading to accusations of transphobia and sexism.\n\nBut wait, the customer is a male-passing woman. If they identify as a woman, but present as male or in a way that's not immediately recognizable, does their gender affect the policy? The shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived by the staff, which could be problematic. If the customer identifies as a woman and is requesting a men's cut, the shop's policy might not account for this scenario. The issue here is whether the policy is applied based on the customer's self-identification or the staff's perception.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, allowing the female stylist to handle those appointments. The problem arises when the customer's gender isn't clearly known at the time of service. The staff might not have known the customer's gender until they arrived, making it impossible to schedule the female stylist. However, the policy requires appointments for women, so the customer should have scheduled one in advance. The manager's reasoning is that they need time to bring in the female employee, but if the policy is strictly enforced, not allowing exceptions even in cases where the customer's gender wasn't known until arrival might be a problem.\n\nAnother angle is the religious aspect. The staff's discomfort is due to religious beliefs, but they also mentioned that women's hair requires different tools and products. If the staff isn't trained to handle women's hair, then they are following the policy correctly by not attempting a women's cut. However, the customer is asking for a men's cut, which might not require the same tools or products, but the staff's religious beliefs still prevent them from cutting a woman's hair regardless of the cut style. This creates a conflict between the customer's needs and the staff's beliefs.\n\nThe manager is caught between respecting their employees' religious convictions and providing service to all customers. The policy is in place to accommodate both by ensuring women are served by the female stylist. But if the customer doesn't identify as a woman or isn't recognized as such until arrival, the policy might not work smoothly. The customer's frustration is understandable if they felt the policy was applied inconsistently or without considering their specific situation.\n\nIn terms of discrimination, the shop's policy is based on gender, which could be seen as discriminatory if it's applied in a way that excludes certain groups. However, the policy is meant to respect the employees' religious beliefs and provide appropriate service. If the policy is clearly communicated and the customer had the opportunity to book an appointment, then the shop might not be at fault. However, if the policy was applied without considering the customer's self-identification or if the customer was denied service without a valid reason, then the shop could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nUltimately, the answer hinges on whether the policy was applied fairly and if there was an opportunity for the customer to comply with the appointment system. If the shop made their policies clear and the customer didn't follow them, then the shop isn't at fault. If the shop denied service without offering an alternative (like rescheduling or explaining the policy clearly), then they might be in the wrong. The manager's reasoning about employee comfort and service quality is valid, but the execution might have been flawed in this specific case.\n"
