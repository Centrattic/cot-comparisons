We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is a manager at a barbershop that's mostly Muslim. They have a policy that women need appointments because they have a contracted female barber. They also mention that they don't train in women's hair due to religious beliefs, and that their staff isn't comfortable cutting women's hair. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The staff refused, and the customer called them transphobic, etc.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants to know if that's the case. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the policy is stated on their website, Facebook, etc. So they're up front about serving women on appointments. That seems fair. The customer might not have checked those details, but that's on them. However, the customer identifies as a male-passing woman. If they look like a man, maybe the staff didn't realize they were a woman. But the staff's policy is based on gender, so if the customer presented as male, maybe the staff didn't know they were a woman. However, the customer said they wanted a man's cut, which might have led the staff to think it's okay. But then they found out it's a woman, so they refused. Or maybe the customer's gender wasn't clear and they just assumed.\n\nBut the main point is the policy. The staff's policy is that women need appointments. If the customer is a woman, even if they pass as male, the policy applies. The staff might not be trained to cut women's hair and have religious reasons. But the problem here is that the customer might not have known the gender-based policy. If the customer presented as male, maybe the staff didn't check, but then changed their mind. That could be seen as discriminatory against transgender individuals. Also, the staff's refusal to serve based on gender could be considered sexist or transphobic if they didn't serve someone who doesn't fit traditional gender norms.\n\nAlso, the staff's religious beliefs are cited as a reason. But in many places, religious exemptions don't cover refusing service based on gender identity. For example, in some jurisdictions, businesses can't discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals even if it's based on religion. So if the customer is a trans man or non-binary identifying as male, the staff's policy could be problematic. The staff might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not serving them because of their gender identity.\n\nAdditionally, the staff's policy of only serving women through appointments is a way to comply with their religious beliefs, which might be acceptable. But if the customer is a woman (cis or trans) who doesn't need a different technique, the staff's refusal based on gender could still be an issue. The staff is making a distinction based on gender, which might be protected under their religion, but if the customer's gender identity doesn't align with the staff's perception, that's a conflict.\n\nSo, the author's stance is that they followed their policy, but the customer felt discriminated against. Depending on the laws in their area, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating a customer's gender identity, even if their policy is based on religious beliefs. The key factors are whether the customer's gender identity was known or should have been known, and whether the business's policy violates local anti-discrimination laws.\n"
