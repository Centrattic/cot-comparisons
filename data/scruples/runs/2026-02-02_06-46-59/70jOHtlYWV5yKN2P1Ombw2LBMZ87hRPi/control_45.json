We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman and the salon has a policy that requires appointments for women. The salon's policy is based on their religious beliefs, as they're primarily Muslim and have a rule about not cutting women's hair unless it's family. They don't train in women's hair because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. The salon's policy is to require appointments for women, which allows them to bring in their contracted female stylist. The author explains that their staff isn't trained in women's hair due to religious reasons and that they can't touch women's hair except for family members. The customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nNow, thinking about legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. However, religious exemptions might apply. But if the business is open to the public, they might be required to serve everyone without discrimination. The policy of only serving women by appointment could be seen as discriminatory, especially if it's based on gender.\n\nThe customer is male-passing, which complicates things. If they identify as male, then the salon's policy requiring appointments for women might not apply. But the customer might have presented as male but wanted a men's cut, so the salon's policy might have confused the situation. If the customer is a woman who passes as male, the salon's policy is based on the customer's gender, not their gender identity. \n\nAlso, the salon's reasoning about training and religious beliefs might not hold up under anti-discrimination laws. Even if their training is due to religion, if it leads to discrimination against customers based on gender or gender identity, they could be in violation. The fact that they have a female stylist available on contract might not be sufficient if the customer couldn't get an appointment on short notice.\n\nMoreover, the customer was accused of being transphobic, but the salon's policy seems to be based on the customer's sex assigned at birth rather than their gender identity. However, if the customer identifies as male, then the policy's application is questionable. But if the customer is a woman who doesn't identify as male, then the policy might be discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the salon is prioritizing their employees' comfort and religious beliefs over the customer's right to service. While religious freedom is a consideration, it's balanced against anti-discrimination laws. Public accommodations laws often take precedence, meaning businesses must serve everyone regardless of their beliefs unless there's a specific exemption.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be considered discriminatory. The policy is based on the customer's gender, and by not accommodating a male-passing woman, they denied service. Even if the customer is a woman, the policy's application without considering gender identity could be problematic. The author is in the wrong because they discriminated based on gender, which is illegal in many places, and their religious justification might not be sufficient to override that.\n"
