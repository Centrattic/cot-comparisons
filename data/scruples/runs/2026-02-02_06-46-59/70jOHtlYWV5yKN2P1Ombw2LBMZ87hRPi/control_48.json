We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman and they don't cut women's hair unless they have an appointment for their female barber. The situation involves religious beliefs and business policies.\n\nFirst, the key points: The shop primarily serves men, has a female barber available by appointment, and states this on their website and signs. They mention that their policy is based on religious beliefs where they shouldn't touch women's hair unless it's family. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The manager explained they can't do it because they need to schedule the female barber, but the customer felt discriminated against and called them transphobic, etc.\n\nNow, considering the law. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the shop has religious beliefs, the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination laws might require them to serve all customers regardless of gender identity. The fact that the customer is male-passing complicates things. However, if the business's policy excludes transgender individuals, that could be a form of discrimination. \n\nThe business's policy is to require appointments for women, which they claim is to ensure proper service. But if the customer identifies as male but is perceived as female, the policy might not apply, or the business might still be required to serve them under anti-discrimination laws. \n\nAlso, the shop's reasoning about religious beliefs needing to not touch women's hair. While freedom of religion is a right, it's not absolute and doesn't override anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the U.S., Title VII allows religion-based claims but they have to be reasonable and not impose undue hardship. If the business can't serve the customer without violating their religious beliefs, but the customer believes it's discrimination based on gender identity, the law would likely side with the customer.\n\nAdditionally, the business's stance on training and tools for women's hair might not be a valid excuse if they can accommodate the customer by using their female barber, even if they have to schedule it. The fact that they have a female barber available by appointment suggests they can adjust, but they didn't make the effort in this case.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the manager probably is in the wrong. The business's policy based on religious beliefs doesn't override the customer's rights to be served without discrimination. Even if the customer's gender identity is a point of confusion, the business should have a way to accommodate them without violating anti-discrimination laws. The manager's refusal led to the customer feeling transphobic treatment, and legally, the business might be liable here.\n"
