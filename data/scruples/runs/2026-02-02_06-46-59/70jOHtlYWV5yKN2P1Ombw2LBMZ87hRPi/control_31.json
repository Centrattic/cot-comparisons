We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is that the author is a barber and manager of a shop that mainly serves men. They have a policy that women need appointments, and they have one female barber who's contracted as needed. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, and the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair because of religious reasons. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The shop's policy is clear about appointments for women, stated on their website and social media. The author explains that their religious beliefs prevent the male barbers from cutting women's hair, except for family. They mention that the female barber isn't available at the time. The customer didn't have an appointment and was turned away. The customer felt discriminated against because they identify as a woman but present as male and wanted a men's cut.\n\nNow, legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the policy is stated, if the customer doesn't identify as the gender the policy is for, it could be a problem. The customer is transgender, which might fall under protected categories. The shop's policy might inadvertently exclude transgender individuals. Also, the shop's reasoning about religious beliefs might not override anti-discrimination laws. \n\nReligious exemptions: Some places allow businesses to cite religious beliefs, but if that leads to discrimination against protected classes, it's a gray area. The shop is Muslim, so maybe there's a religious justification, but how does that interact with the customer's rights? The customer is male-passing, so they might not present as female to the barbers, which could mean the shop didn't realize they were serving someone who identifies as a woman. But the policy is based on biological sex, not gender identity. \n\nThe shop's policy might be outdated or not inclusive. The customer's argument is that their gender identity should be respected. The shop's stance could be seen as transphobic because they're applying a rule based on perceived sex rather than the customer's actual identity. Even if the policy is clear, if it's leading to discrimination against transgender people, that's an issue. \n\nAlso, the shop mentions they serve all sorts of customers, but the policy creates a barrier. The customer might not have known they needed an appointment for their gender identity. The shop's policy is for women, but if the customer is a transgender man, they might not book an appointment, leading to conflict. The shop's explanation about needing the female barber for appointments might not be feasible if she's only available by appointment, which the customer couldn't make on the spot.\n\nAnother angle: the shop could have made an exception. The customer was willing to accept the same price and just needed a few hours notice. The author says they couldn't do it because the female barber wasn't available that day. But maybe the shop could have rescheduled or found a way. However, if the female barber isn't working that day, they can't serve the customer. But the customer might not know that the female barber is only available certain days. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, the shop should probably review their policies to be inclusive of transgender individuals. If the policy is based on biological sex, but the customer identifies as a woman, even if they present as male, the shop's policy might exclude them. The shop's religious beliefs are a factor, but they need to balance that with non-discrimination laws and ethical treatment of customers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be considered discriminatory against transgender individuals. The policy, while clear, doesn't account for gender identity, leading to a situation where the customer felt they were being excluded. The shop's reasoning based on religion and their operational constraints might not be sufficient to justify the refusal, especially if it results in discrimination. Therefore, the author might be at fault here.\n"
