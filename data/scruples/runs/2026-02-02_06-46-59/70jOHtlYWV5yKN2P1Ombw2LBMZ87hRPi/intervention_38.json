We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men, with 99% male customers. They have a woman barber who works on an appointment basis. The shop has made it clear online and with signage that they require appointments for women. The staff is mostly Muslim, and their policy is based on religious beliefs about not cutting women's hair unless it's a family member. The author mentions that the rule applies to the staff's comfort and training, not just religious reasons, since women's hair can require different techniques and products.\n\nNow, the situation involved a customer who identifies as a male-passing woman wanting a men's style haircut. The author tried to explain the appointment policy, but the customer became upset, accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left in anger. The author feels bad but is concerned about employee comfort and service quality.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for not cutting the customer's hair?\n\nLet me consider the arguments. The author's side is that they have a policy based on religious beliefs and practical reasons (staff training, tools, etc.). They explicitly stated the policy, so the customer should have been aware. They also mention that they could have tried to call in the female barber if given a couple of hours' notice, but the customer wasn't listening to that explanation.\n\nOn the other side, the customer felt discriminated against. The argument here is that the customer identified as a woman but wanted a men's cut, which might not require the same treatment as women's hair. The policy is based on the customer's gender, which is a protected category in many places. The author's policy might be seen as discriminatory towards women and transgender individuals. Even if the policy was in place for non-discriminatory reasons, applying it in a way that categorizes people based on gender could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the religious exemption is a tricky point. In some jurisdictions, businesses can claim religious exemptions, but this often depends on local laws. However, if the policy is applied in a way that denies service to certain individuals regardless of their presentation or identity, it could be considered discriminatory. The fact that the customer is a male-passing woman complicates things. The staff's discomfort might be based on the customer's gender identity, which could be seen as transphobic.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the woman barber is available on appointment. So, if the customer had scheduled an appointment, they could have been served. But the author's response was to explain the policy, not deny service outright. However, the customer might not have been aware of the appointment system, or the explanation wasn't clear. The author's policy was in place, but the customer felt it was a denial of service.\n\nThere's also the aspect of how the policy is communicated. If they have it clearly stated on their website and signs, maybe the customer should have known. But maybe the customer didn't see that, or the explanation given in person wasn't sufficient. The author tried to explain, but the customer didn't accept it. That could be a matter of communication rather than the policy itself.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, if the policy is based on gender and not based on the type of service needed, it could be considered discriminatory. Even if the reason is religious, in some places, anti-discrimination laws might override religious exemptions, especially in public accommodation contexts. However, in other places, religious exemptions are allowed.\n\nThe author is also considering employee comfort and training. If the staff isn't trained to handle women's hair, it could affect the quality of service. But if the customer is clearly presenting as male and wants a men's cut, maybe the staff could handle it regardless of their gender. The author's staff's discomfort could be based on the customer's gender, which is part of the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's policy is based on gender, which could lead to discrimination. The author tried to explain the policy, but the customer felt it was an outright denial. The religious aspect is a factor, but if it leads to discrimination, it might not be a valid defense. Also, the fact that there's a female barber available on appointment suggests that the shop can serve women, but the policy requires appointments, which might not be a reason to deny service on the spot. However, if the shop isn't equipped to handle walk-ins for women, maybe that's part of the policy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if their policy is based on gender and leads to discrimination, even if it's justified by religious beliefs. The key is whether the policy is applied in a way that's illegal or unethical. The answer depends on local laws, but ethically, prioritizing the customer's right to service over the staff's religious beliefs might be the case. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
