We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: they list that they mainly serve men and have a female stylist available by appointment. The manager explains that male employees can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, which is why appointments are needed for women. The customer in question identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. The staff felt uncomfortable cutting their hair, possibly because of gender norms or religious restrictions.\n\nThe key points here are the shop's stated policies and the reasons behind them. The manager mentions that the policy is in place to ensure women get proper service, as the tools and techniques differ. However, in this case, the customer is a woman presenting as male, which complicates things. The shop might not have trained their male employees to handle female hair due to religious reasons, which could be a problem if they're not accommodating transgender or non-binary customers.\n\nThere's a conflict between the shop's religious practices and the customer's gender identity. The customer was denied service even though they wanted a men's cut, which the shop might not be comfortable providing due to their policies. The manager argues that they need time to bring in the female stylist, but the customer didn't want to wait. \n\nNow, considering legal aspects: in many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity or discrimination laws. Even if a business has religious exemptions, they can't discriminate against customers. The shop's policy might be okay for cisgender women, but refusing a transgender man or non-binary person who identifies as male could be seen as discrimination. \n\nAlso, the manager mentions that they train male employees in men's hair but not women's. If they can't serve a male-presenting woman because of their rules, even if the customer is comfortable with it, that's a point against them. The customer isn't a woman in the traditional sense here, so the policy might be too rigid.\n\nSo, the manager's stance could be considered discriminatory against the transgender or non-binary community. The shop's policies might not account for gender identity, which is a significant oversight. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer based on gender identity when the service requested aligns with the male service the shop offers.\n"
