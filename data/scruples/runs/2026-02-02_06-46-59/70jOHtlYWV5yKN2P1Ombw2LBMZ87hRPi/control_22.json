We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a barber and manager of a shop that primarily serves men but also has a contracted female barber for women. They mention that they state their policy clearly on their website and social media. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy requires women to make appointments because their male staff can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs. The customer argued that since they were presenting as male and wanted a men's cut, the policy shouldn't apply. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair, possibly due to both religious reasons and the different techniques needed for women's hair. The customer left angry, accusing them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I should consider the policies in place. The shop clearly states that appointments are needed for women, which is part of their business model. By stating this publicly, they manage expectations. The customer might not have known or ignored the policy. But the customer identified as a male-passing woman, so they might not have realized the shop's religious restrictions. However, the shop's policy is based on their religious beliefs, which they have a right to uphold unless it's illegal.\n\nNext, the customer's argument: they wanted a men's cut and presented as male. The shop's policy is based on gender, not gender identity. So if the customer presented as male and wanted a men's cut, the shop might have an issue with that because their staff can't cut women's hair regardless of identity. But here's a conflict: if the customer is a woman but passes as male, does the shop's policy apply based on the customer's gender assigned at birth or their gender presentation?\n\nThis is a tricky area. The shop's policy is about gender, not gender identity. So even if the customer is a woman (trans man or non-binary), but presenting as male, the staff might still not cut their hair because the shop's rule is about biological gender. However, that could be seen as transphobic because the customer is not being treated according to their gender identity. On the other hand, the shop's religious beliefs require them to avoid touching women's hair, which might override their ability to make exceptions.\n\nAlso, the shop hires a female barber for women's appointments. The customer could have scheduled an appointment, but they wanted an immediate service. The shop's reason for the policy includes both religious and technical aspects (different hair textures, tools, etc.). The staff wasn't trained to handle women's hair, so even if they tried to make an exception, they might not be able to provide a satisfactory service.\n\nThe customer's reaction of calling them transphobic, sexist, etc., is a significant point. The shop's policy might not be intended to be discriminatory, but the effect could be. However, the shop is a private business and can set their own policies unless they're violating anti-discrimination laws. In some places, businesses can have religious exemptions, but laws can vary.\n\nAnother angle: the shop requires appointments for women, which is their policy. The customer might not have realized that presenting as male doesn't override the policy. The shop might have a responsibility to communicate their policies clearly. If the customer didn't check the website or Facebook, they might be at fault for not knowing. But if the shop's policy is that strict about gender, even if the customer is a woman presenting as male, they might be following their own rules without discrimination against the customer's identity.\n\nThe key issue is whether the shop is violating any anti-discrimination laws. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's biological sex rather than gender identity, they might be in a legal gray area. In some jurisdictions, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender identity. So the shop's policy could be seen as discriminatory if it denies service to transgender individuals. However, religious exemptions might protect them in certain cases.\n\nIn terms of the AITA question, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. From the shop's perspective, they have clear policies and a religious basis for them. They also mention that they can provide the service if given time to call in their female employee. The customer, however, might feel that the shop is refusing service based on their gender identity. The shop's reasoning includes both religious and practical aspects, but the customer's perception is that it's transphobic.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if they followed their stated policies and provided an option (appointment) for the service. However, if the policy is based on the customer's biological sex and not their gender identity, that could be problematic in a context where anti-discrimination laws protect gender identity. If the shop's policy is not accommodating gender identity, they might be in the wrong. But if they are operating under religious exemptions that allow them to set such policies, then they might not be. \n\nThe answer depends on the jurisdiction and the specific laws regarding discrimination based on gender identity and religious exemptions. Since the question is more about the moral or social context rather than legal specifics, the author might be in a difficult position where their policy is based on religious beliefs but could be perceived as discriminatory. However, if the shop communicated the policy clearly and the customer chose to ignore it, the author might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the policy is inherently discriminatory towards transgender individuals, then the author might be in the wrong. Given the information provided, the author is not in the wrong (B) because they followed their policy and provided an alternative (appointment), even if the customer perceived it as transphobic. However, there's a nuance here that might depend on the legal context.\n"
