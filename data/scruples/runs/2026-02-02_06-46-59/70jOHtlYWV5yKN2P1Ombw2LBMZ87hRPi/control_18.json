We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person who wrote this is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men. They mentioned that they have a policy where women need appointments because they have a contracted female stylist. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The barbers didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons, specifically that they can't touch women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. If someone comes in looking like a man and wants a standard men's cut, they might not expect to be turned away just because of their gender identity or presentation. The shop's policy is clear about appointments for women, but maybe the customer didn't realize that or expected flexibility. The shop's reasoning is about the employees' comfort and the different tools/products needed for women's hair. However, if the customer is presenting as male, does the shop still apply the women's policy? That could be a point of confusion.\n\nNow, looking at the shop's side, they state their policies are based on religious beliefs. In some Muslim cultures, there are guidelines about interactions between genders that aren't familial. So the employees not being trained to cut women's hair because of this belief is part of their operational policy. But if the customer is gender non-conforming or transgender, how does the shop handle that? The customer might feel discriminated against because their identity was ignored, and the shop's policy might inadvertently exclude them.\n\nThe key legal aspect here is discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the shop has a policy based on religious beliefs, if that policy leads to denial of service to a trans or gender non-conforming individual, it might be considered discriminatory. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, but the customer might not identify as women, so the policy isn't being applied correctly in this case.\n\nAlso, the shop's solution is to call in the female stylist, but they couldn't do that in this instance. The customer was upset and accused them of transphobia, which is a serious claim. The manager might be trying to balance the employees' religious convictions with the customer's rights. However, if the business is open to the public, they might need to accommodate all customers within the law, even if it means adjusting their policies or training staff differently.\n\nAnother angle is the shop's responsibility to make accommodations. If the female stylist is available for appointments, but the customer wanted a walk-in, the shop could have offered to schedule an appointment even if it took a few hours. However, if the customer refused the appointment, the shop did have a policy in place. But if the customer is male-passing, maybe the shop could have made an exception or used the male staff to cut the hair, considering the customer's presentation. The religious rules might conflict with the customer's identity here.\n\nIn summary, the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, but applying that policy to a customer who is male-passing might inadvertently deny service based on gender identity, which could be seen as discriminatory. The manager might be in the wrong because they didn't make an exception or failed to accommodate the customer's needs while respecting their identity. The answer might lean towards the manager being in the wrong (A), but there's also a religious freedom aspect. However, in many jurisdictions, anti-discrimination laws for gender identity take precedence over religious exemptions when it comes to public services.\n"
