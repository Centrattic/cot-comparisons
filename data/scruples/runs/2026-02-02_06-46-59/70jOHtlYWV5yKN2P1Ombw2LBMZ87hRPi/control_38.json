We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's asking if they're at fault for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut, but the shop has a policy that requires appointments for women and doesn't allow male barbers to cut women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: they mention on their website and signage that they require appointments for women. They have a female barber available on a contract basis. The customer didn't make an appointment, so according to the policy, they can't be served. The customer argues it's a man's cut, but the policy isn't about the style but the gender of the customer. The shop's stance is based on religious beliefs about not touching women's hair except for family, and they don't train male barbers on women's hair because of that.\n\nThe customer got upset, called the shop transphobic, sexist, etc., and left. The manager feels bad but also has to consider employee comfort and service quality.\n\nNow, considering the policies were clearly stated, and the customer didn't follow them, the shop isn't wrong in enforcing their own rules. However, the issue might be whether the policy is discriminatory. Since they allow a female barber for women and the policy is based on religious beliefs (which they state upfront), it's a matter of their right to run their business according to their values. The customer didn't book an appointment, so the shop can't be blamed for not accommodating last-minute requests outside their policy. The manager isn't in the wrong here because they followed their own guidelines and provided a solution (appointments with the female barber). Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
