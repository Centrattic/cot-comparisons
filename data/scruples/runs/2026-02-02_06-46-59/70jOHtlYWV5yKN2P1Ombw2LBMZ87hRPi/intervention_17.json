We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a barber who's a manager at a shop that primarily serves men but has a policy requiring appointments for women because they have one female barber who's contracted. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop couldn't accommodate because their policy and religious beliefs prevent male barbers from cutting women's hair. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: they state on their website, signs, etc., that they require appointments for women. So the customer might not have known beforehand, but the author mentions that the policy is public. If the customer didn't check the website or signs, maybe that's on them. However, the customer might not have known their hair is considered female due to the policy being based on gender, not gender identity. That's a point. The author is Muslim, and their religious beliefs prevent male employees from cutting women's hair. They don't train in women's hair because of that. The customer was male-passing, so the barbers might not have been sure if they were a woman or not. But if the policy is based on gender, then maybe the customer's identity as a trans man complicates things. However, the shop's policy is about the customer's perceived gender, not their identity. \n\nThe author says they didn't have the female barber available that day, so they couldn't serve the customer. The customer wanted a men's cut but the shop's policy is about the customer's gender, not the cut type. The author's reasoning is that the appointment system is for women to be served properly, considering different hair textures and tools, but also due to religious rules. \n\nNow, the customer accused them of being transphobic. If the customer is a trans man, they might identify as male, so the shop's policy based on perceived gender could be problematic. The shop might be discriminating against trans men by refusing service based on their appearance. However, if the shop's policy is strict about biological sex, then maybe they have a policy, but in reality, many places now consider gender identity. The author's shop is Muslim, so maybe their religious beliefs take precedence here, but laws in many places require serving all customers regardless of gender identity. \n\nThere's also the aspect of employees not being comfortable cutting the customer's hair. The author mentions the staff aren't trained in women's hair due to religion. But if the customer is non-binary or trans, this could be seen as discrimination. The author is prioritizing the employees' comfort and the shop's policy over the customer's needs, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nThe key points are: the shop's policy is based on perceived gender, the customer's identity vs. appearance, religious exemptions versus anti-discrimination laws, and whether the policy is applied consistently. The author might argue that they have a policy and can't be forced to change it, but others might see it as discriminatory. If the shop is in a place where anti-discrimination laws protect gender identity, then they might be in the wrong. Also, if the customer was not a woman in the shop's terms but a trans man, the policy could be exclusionary. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they refused service based on the customer's gender presentation, which could be seen as transphobic, especially if the customer is a trans man who is perceived as a woman. The policy might not account for gender identity, leading to discrimination. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
