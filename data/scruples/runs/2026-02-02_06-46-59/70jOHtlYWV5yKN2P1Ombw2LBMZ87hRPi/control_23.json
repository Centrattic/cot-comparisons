We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a manager at a barbershop that mainly serves men, and they have a policy that women need appointments so they can bring in a female barber. Now, a customer who is a male-passing woman comes in wanting a haircut. The shop's policy is that women need appointments, and the staff isn't trained or comfortable cutting women's hair because of religious reasons. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic and sexist. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. If the policy is refusing service to someone based on their perceived gender or gender identity, that could be illegal. Even if the business states their policy, if it results in denying service to a protected class, they might be violating anti-discrimination laws. \n\nThen there's the religious argument. The business claims the policy is based on their religious beliefs. However, laws often require accommodations for religious practices, but they also prevent using religion as a justification for discrimination. For example, in the U.S., Title VII allows religious exemptions but also prohibits discrimination based on sex, including transgender status. There might be a conflict here between the business's religious practices and the customer's rights.\n\nThe business's policy of requiring appointments for women is a way to manage their service, but if the customer doesn't identify as a woman or is a female-presenting male, the policy might not apply the same. If the customer is male, then the policy allowing male barbers to cut their hair would be appropriate. However, if the customer is a transgender man, then the policy might be excluding them based on gender identity, which is a more complex issue.\n\nAlso, the business mentions that they don't train in women's hair because of religion. If the customer is a woman, then the business is following their policy. But if the customer is a male-presenting female, the business's refusal to provide the service might be based on gender expression, which could be problematic. The business might be conflating gender with hair texture or other factors, but that's not a valid legal distinction if the customer is perceived as a woman.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's perspective. They wanted a standard men's cut and felt their request was denied based on their gender, leading to accusations of transphobia. The business's stance is that they can't serve women due to religious reasons, but if the customer is a woman (even if passing as male), the policy would require an appointment. However, if the customer is a male who identifies as female, the business's policy might be excluding them based on their gender identity, which could be a form of discrimination.\n\nThe business's need to protect their employees' religious beliefs versus the customer's right to service is a key point. Some argue that businesses have the right to hold religious beliefs, but others state that this shouldn't override anti-discrimination laws. For example, in some jurisdictions, businesses can't cite religious freedom to refuse service to LGBTQ+ individuals. The balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination protections is a current legal debate.\n\nIn conclusion, the business might be in violation of anti-discrimination laws by refusing service based on the customer's gender identity or expression, especially if the customer is transgender or non-binary. Even if the business's intention is to comply with religious practices, the effect is excluding a protected group from services, which could make the author (manager) in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
