We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager in a primarily Muslim establishment. They have a policy that requires women to make appointments so the contracted female barber can be called in. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The manager refused because of the policy, leading the customer to accuse them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policy's intent. The shop's stated policy is to require appointments for women to ensure they can be served by the female barber. The manager mentions that the staff isn't trained in women's hair due to religious reasons. So, they can't cut women's hair because of their beliefs, not because of the customer's gender per se, but the biological sex associated with the hair texture and tools. However, the customer is a woman who presents as male, so her gender identity might be a factor here.\n\nThe question is whether the manager is in the wrong. On one hand, the policy is clear and based on their religious beliefs and the need to provide appropriate service. The manager is following the established procedure to respect both their staff's comfort and the technical aspects of haircuts. On the other hand, the customer might feel discriminated against because she's a woman who doesn't conform to traditional gender presentation. The term \"transphobic\" could imply that the policy is targeting transgender individuals, but the policy is about the service provided, not the customer's identity. \n\nI also need to think about legal aspects, especially in regions where discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. However, the policy is based on the sex of the barber and the customer, not on the customer's gender identity. The manager's reasoning is about staff training and comfort, not the customer's gender expression. But if the policy is applied without exception, even if the customer is male-presenting, that might be seen as not accommodating their actual identity. \n\nAnother angle: when the customer asked for a men's cut, the manager should have considered that maybe they can be served by the male barbers. But the policy is in place because the male barbers are not trained for women's hair. The customer might be arguing that if they look like a man, they should be treated the same. However, the barbers might still be uncomfortable based on the customer's biological sex, not their presentation. \n\nSo, the manager's stance is about the staff's comfort and service quality, but the perception is discrimination against a trans woman. The key point is whether the policy is based on the customer's gender identity or their sex. If it's the latter, then the manager might be following their religious guidelines, but if it's the former, it could be seen as transphobic. The situation is tricky because the policy is clear but the application in this case might not align with the customer's expectations of being treated according to their gender identity. \n\nI should also consider if the manager could have been more accommodating. Maybe the female barber can be called in on short notice. The manager says they need a couple of hours notice, but if the customer is a woman, regardless of passing as male, does the policy strictly require an appointment? The customer might have expected to be served when they walked in, not knowing about the appointment requirement. The manager's response was firm, leading to conflict. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting employees' religious beliefs is important, but also ensuring that all customers are treated fairly. If the policy is applied without exceptions, even when the customer is female but male-presenting, it could be seen as not respecting their identity. However, the manager's responsibility to their staff and their religious practices might override that. \n\nSo, the manager isn't necessarily in the wrong from a religious standpoint, but the way they handled the situation might have been perceived as discriminatory. The customer might not understand the policy and the reasoning behind it, leading to the accusations. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction and anti-discrimination laws, but if the policy is based on the sex of the customer (as per the barber's training), then it's not the manager's fault. However, if the policy is based on the customer's gender expression, that's problematic. The user is a woman seeking the same service as a man, but the policy is about the barber's sex. So, the manager is not in the wrong, but perhaps the policy could be revisited for better clarity and inclusivity.\n"
