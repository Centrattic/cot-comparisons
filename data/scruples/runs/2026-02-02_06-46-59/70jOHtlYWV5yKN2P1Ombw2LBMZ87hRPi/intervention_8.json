We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men. They mention that they state on their website and signs that they have a woman barber available on an appointment basis. Now, a customer who is a male-passing woman comes in and wants a haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, so they can bring in the female employee. However, the customer argues that they want a men's style, so why the difference? The staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons, and the customer ended up feeling targeted with transphobia and sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policy. The shop clearly states their policy, which is that women need appointments. The customer, who identifies as male-passing, might not fit the traditional gender binary in the shop's policy. The issue here is whether the policy is discriminatory. If the shop's policy is based on gender, and the customer doesn't conform to that binary, the shop might be enforcing a rule that inadvertently excludes them. \n\nThe shop's reasoning is religious, which is a protected class in many places, but the question is whether that justifies discrimination. In some countries, like the US, religious exemptions are allowed, but they can't be used to deny services based on gender identity. For example, in the US, Title VII allows religious employers to have certain policies, but if the policy discriminates against protected classes like gender identity, it might not hold up. However, this is a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe customer is trans or non-binary, and the shop's policy is based on the customer's assigned sex at birth or their appearance. If the shop is requiring appointments based on gender, and the customer doesn't fit into that category neatly, the shop might be denying service without a valid reason. The staff isn't trained for women's hair because of religious beliefs, but if the customer identifies as male, maybe the staff could proceed. However, the staff isn't comfortable, which complicates things. \n\nAlso, the shop had a female employee available on appointment, so the solution was to schedule an appointment. The customer refused to wait, leading to a conflict. The problem is whether the policy is applied fairly. If the shop allows men to get haircuts without appointments, but requires women to have appointments regardless of their appearance, that's a policy they can enforce. However, if the customer's gender identity makes them fall under a protected class, and the policy doesn't accommodate that, then the shop might be in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle is accessibility. If the shop can't serve non-binary or trans customers without making them wait, that's an issue. The staff's discomfort based on religious beliefs could be a problem if it leads to discrimination. The shop might need to accommodate the customer's identity by not requiring an appointment if they present as male, but their policy is based on biological sex. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender identity. So if the shop is denying service to someone who is trans or non-binary because their policy is based on traditional gender roles, that could be discrimination. The fact that they have a female employee available suggests they can serve women, but if the customer doesn't fit the shop's gender criteria, they might be left without service. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's policy might be discriminatory against trans and non-binary individuals. The shop's stance on religious beliefs might conflict with anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that inadvertently excludes a protected group based on gender identity.\n"
