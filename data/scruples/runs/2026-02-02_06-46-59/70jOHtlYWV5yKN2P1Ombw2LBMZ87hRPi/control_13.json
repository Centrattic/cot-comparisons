We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the manager is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The salon has a policy that requires appointments for women, and they only have one female barber who's contracted. The manager explains that due to religious beliefs, male employees can't cut women's hair unless it's family, and they don't train for women's hair. The customer got upset, called them transphobic and sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. The customer identified as a male-passing woman, so they might consider themselves a man. If the policy is based on the customer's perceived gender, that could be an issue. The policy requires appointments for women, but if the customer presents as a man, they might not be classified under the appointment system, leading to denial of service. However, if the salon's policy is based on the customer's gender identity, that could be discriminatory.\n\nReligious exemptions are tricky. Some places allow businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, but this varies. However, if the refusal is based on the customer's gender identity rather than their biological sex, it might not hold up. The salon's policy is about women's hair, but the customer is a trans man or non-binary person. The salon might argue they follow religious guidelines, but if the customer's gender identity doesn't align with the policy, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the salon's policy is to have women served by the female barber. The customer wants a men's cut, so maybe they don't require a female barber. But the manager says the appointment system is for women, so even if the customer is male-passing, the salon might still require an appointment. However, if the customer is perceived as a man, then the policy might not apply. It's a bit of a conflict here.\n\nAnother angle: the salon's reasoning about hair texture and tools. They mention that women's hair is different and requires specific products/tools, but they don't train for that. If the customer wants a men's cut, maybe the tools aren't an issue. But the main issue is the religious rule about not cutting women's hair. However, if the customer is a trans man, the salon's policy might not account for that, leading to discrimination.\n\nThe customer felt discriminated against, which is a strong point. Even if the salon has policies, if those policies are based on gender identity and not biological sex, it could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the salon's policy is stated on their website, but if the customer doesn't fit neatly into the categories (male-passing woman), the salon might be in a gray area.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the manager's decision might be seen as discriminatory, especially if the customer's gender identity doesn't align with the salon's policies. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong). However, the religious aspect complicates things. Some jurisdictions might allow religious exemptions, but others might not. It's a complex issue, but the main point is that the customer was denied service based on gender identity, which could be illegal in many places.\n"
