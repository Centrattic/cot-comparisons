We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy for appointments for women only, based on religious reasons. The customer felt they were transphobic and sexist. \n\nFirst, the shop's policy is stated publicly, so the customer might have known beforehand. But the customer identified as a male-passing woman, which complicates the situation. The shop's reasoning is about religious practices\u2014specifically, male employees not touching women's hair unless family. However, the customer is questioning the policy because they don't identify as a woman.\n\nIs the policy discriminatory? If the shop is allowing women to book appointments, that's one thing, but denying a customer based on their gender identity might be problematic. The customer wanted a men's cut, so maybe they felt they should be treated like any other male customer. The shop's employees weren't comfortable cutting their hair due to religious reasons, but that's their choice. \n\nThe key points are: the policy is in place, but applying it to someone who doesn't identify as a woman might be an issue. The shop is a private business, so they can have policies, but if those policies lead to discrimination based on gender identity, that's a problem. Also, the customer wasn't informed beforehand that they need an appointment even if they present as male-passing. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the policy is applied in a way that's unfair to transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. The shop's policy could be seen as excluding people based on gender identity, which might be considered discriminatory, even if the policy is publicly stated. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the potential discrimination against transgender individuals. But there's also the religious accommodation aspect for the employees. However, the main issue here is the customer's experience and whether the policy was applied fairly despite their gender identity.\n"
