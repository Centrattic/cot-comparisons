We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is about a barber shop that primarily serves men and has a policy requiring appointments for women, so they can be served by the contracted female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The manager refused because the staff isn't trained for women's hair and there's a religious policy against men cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer called them transphobic, etc., and the manager is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the policies and the reasons behind them. The shop is Muslim, and their religious beliefs prevent men from cutting women's hair. They also mention that their training and tools are different for women's hair. They make this clear on their website and signage. The customer, however, is a trans person or a genderfluid individual who identifies as male-passing and wants a men's cut. \n\nThe manager argues that the policy isn't about the customer's gender identity but about the staff's training and religious rules. However, the customer might not see it that way. If the shop explicitly states they serve women but requires appointments, and the customer doesn't fit neatly into that category, there's a conflict. The customer might feel that being a woman (even if they pass as male) should still qualify for the women's service, but the shop's policy is based on biological sex, not gender identity.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. If the shop is serving women, they might be required to serve transgender women as well. The argument here is whether the religious exemption applies. If the policy is based on religious beliefs, there might be some protection, but it's a gray area, especially if the service is offered to some women and not others based on gender identity.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy could be seen as excluding transgender individuals by not accommodating their identity. Even if the staff isn't trained for women's hair, perhaps they could make an exception or explain the policy more clearly. The manager mentions needing a couple of hours to call in the female barber, but the customer was unwilling to wait. However, if the customer's gender identity is the reason they're not getting the service, that's a problem.\n\nIn terms of transphobia, the shop's policy might inadvertently target transgender people who don't conform to traditional gender norms. The term \"male-passing woman\" complicates things because the customer is identifying as a woman but passes as male. The shop's policy based on biological sex might not account for that, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, the manager isn't necessarily malicious, but the policy has unintended consequences. However, the shop does make their policies clear, which could mitigate some blame. But in terms of discrimination, if the policy leads to excluding someone based on their gender identity, that's where the manager might be in the wrong. It's a tough call because it's about balancing religious freedom with anti-discrimination laws. But given that the shop is in a public space and offers services to women, they might be obligated to serve all women regardless of their gender identity, which the current policy doesn't accommodate. Therefore, the manager is likely in the wrong.\n"
