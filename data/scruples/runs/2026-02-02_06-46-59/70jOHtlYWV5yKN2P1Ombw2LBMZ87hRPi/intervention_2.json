We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who claims they didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer identified as a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy of requiring appointments for women, and they mentioned their Muslim faith influences this, as they don't allow male employees to cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer felt discriminated against and accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, there might be limits. For example, in the U.S., Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, but also protects against discrimination based on sex, which includes gender identity. So if a business's religious practices conflict with providing service to a transgender person, there's a legal gray area. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nEthically, the shop's policy might be seen as excluding transgender individuals because they don't fit into the traditional male/female binary. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut, which complicates the situation. The shop's policy is based on the sex of the customer, but gender identity is different from biological sex. If the customer is trans and presenting as male, the shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic, even if their policy is based on religious beliefs.\n\nAnother angle is the shop's stated policy about serving women. They require appointments for women because they don't train staff in women's haircuts. But if a customer is a trans man, is he considered a woman under their policy? This depends on how the shop defines \"women.\" If they base it on biological sex, a trans man is still a woman biologically. But if they consider gender identity, then the policy might not apply. However, the shop's policy might not account for gender identity, leading to discrimination.\n\nThe shop's argument is about employee comfort and religious beliefs. However, they could have made an exception by calling in the contracted female barber. The customer was denied service without being given an option to schedule an appointment, which might violate the shop's policy. The shop didn't state that they could accommodate by scheduling the female barber with a couple of hours notice, which could have resolved the issue.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the shop's policy might not be inclusive of transgender customers. By refusing service without offering an alternative (like the female barber they have on contract), they could be seen as discriminatory. Even if their intention was based on religious grounds, the impact on the customer's rights is significant. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
