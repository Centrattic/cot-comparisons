We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who mainly serves men but has a policy requiring appointments for women, handled by a contracted female stylist. They got a customer who is a male-passing woman who wanted a man's cut. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons (not allowed to touch women's hair unless family), and they don't train in women's hair. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the key points: the shop's policy is clear about appointments for women, which is communicated online. The customer didn't have an appointment. The staff's religious beliefs prohibit them from cutting women's hair, leading to the refusal. The customer identified as a male-passing woman, but the shop's policy is based on gender, not gender identity.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that they followed their policy and couldn't accommodate due to religious reasons and staff training. However, the customer felt discriminated against based on gender identity and gender expression.\n\nIn many places, anti-discrimination laws protect gender identity and expression. Even if the shop has a religious exemption, the law might require accommodations unless there's an exemption. The fact that the customer was a male-passing woman might complicate things. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex, but the customer identifies as non-binary or transgender, the shop could be seen as discriminating based on gender identity.\n\nAlso, the shop had a solution (calling in the female stylist with a few hours notice), but the customer refused to wait. Did the shop explain that option clearly? The author mentions that the customer wasn't listening to reason. If the shop was willing to make an exception but the customer refused, maybe the shop isn't at fault. But if the refusal was based on the customer's gender, regardless of the solution, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy is clear, but the customer might not have known they were a trans woman. However, the shop's signage might not specify, just that women require appointments. The customer might have assumed that since they pass as male, they could be served like any other male customer. But the shop's policy is based on gender as per their religious practices, not on gender identity.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, some jurisdictions may not allow businesses to discriminate based on gender identity even with religious exemptions. The shop's religious beliefs vs. the customer's right to service. There's also the aspect of not providing equal service to transgender or non-binary individuals, which can be seen as transphobic.\n\nThe author mentions that the female stylist is on contract and requires an appointment. If the customer had an appointment, the shop could serve them. But since they didn't, and the same-day availability wasn't possible, maybe the shop isn't at fault. However, the customer's gender identity might not align with the shop's policy, leading to conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's policy is based on religious beliefs and staff training, but refusing service to a transgender or gender non-conforming person could be considered discrimination. The answer might depend on local laws, but ethically, being transphobic is wrong. So, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
