We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a barbershop that's majority Muslim, with a policy of requiring appointments for women because they have a female barber contracted for those cases. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a man's cut, but the staff, due to religious reasons, weren't trained or comfortable cutting women's hair, so they couldn't serve her without an appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or transgender status. The customer is a woman, but she's presenting as male, so maybe the barbershop's policy of requiring appointments for women might not apply in this case. But the barbershop's policy is clear for women, so if the customer is a woman, regardless of how she presents, the policy would require an appointment. However, there's a nuance here because the customer might identify as non-binary or transgender, which could complicate things legally and socially.\n\nThen there's the religious accommodation angle. The employees, including the author, are Muslim and follow religious guidelines that prevent them from touching women's hair. But the barbershop has a system in place (contracting a female barber) to serve women when appointments are made. The issue here is whether the customer's presentation as male-passing changes the requirement. The customer argued they wanted a man's style, so maybe they felt they should be treated as a male customer. However, the staff still needed to follow their policy regardless of the customer's presentation because the underlying issue is the religious training and comfort in handling women's hair.\n\nThe customer felt discriminated against, calling the barbershop transphobic and sexist. The author defends their position by mentioning they need to protect employees' religious convictions and provide proper service. But if the customer is a woman, even if she's male-passing, the policy is in place for women. The key here is whether the policy is applied consistently and if there's a way to accommodate without violating religious beliefs.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in some regions, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. If the customer is a transgender man or non-binary person, the barbershop's policy might be seen as discriminatory. However, if the customer is a cisgender woman who's male-passing, the policy is still applicable. But the line between cisgender and transgender here is important. The barbershop's policy is for all women, so they're not directly targeting transgender individuals. However, the customer's experience of being denied service because of their gender presentation, even if they are a woman, could be seen as problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the business's responsibility to accommodate all customers. The author mentions they could have called in the female barber if given a few hours notice, but the customer didn't make an appointment. If the customer couldn't wait, maybe the barbershop is within their policy to deny service. But if the customer was unaware of the policy and the barbershop didn't clearly communicate it, that's a different issue. However, the post states that the policy is stated on signage and website, so communication isn't the problem here.\n\nThe barbershop's reasoning is based on religious beliefs and employee training. However, in many places, religious exemptions don't override anti-discrimination laws when it comes to public accommodations. The employees' right to practice their religion should be balanced with the customer's right to equal service. The barbershop has a system in place for women, so the issue here is whether the customer's presentation as male-passing allows them to bypass the appointment system. If the customer is indeed a woman, they should follow the same policy. But if they identify as non-binary or male, the barbershop's policy might not apply, and there's a conflict between the customer's identity and the barbershop's policy.\n\nIn conclusion, the barbershop's policy is clear and applied to all women, regardless of presentation. They have a process in place for women, which requires an appointment. The customer didn't make an appointment, so the barbershop wasn't in the wrong for following their policy. However, the customer might feel discriminated against due to their gender presentation, which complicates the situation. But legally and according to their stated policy, the barbershop is not in the wrong. However, there's a social aspect where the customer's experience of being denied service might be seen as transphobic, but if the policy is applied consistently to all women, it might not be. The answer hinges on whether the customer is a woman (cisgender or transgender) and if the policy is applied without exception.\n"
