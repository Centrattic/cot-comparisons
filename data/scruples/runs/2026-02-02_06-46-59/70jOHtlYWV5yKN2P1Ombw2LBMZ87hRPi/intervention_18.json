We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is a barber and manager at a Muslim barbershop that primarily serves men. They have a policy where women need appointments to be served by the female barber. A customer who is a male-passing woman came in without an appointment and wanted a men's haircut. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons and the policy. The customer left upset, accusing them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's stated policies. They clearly advertise that women need appointments, which is communicated on their website, Facebook, etc. So the customer should have known about this policy before coming in. The manager is explaining that they can't cut women's hair because of religious beliefs and the fact that their male staff isn't trained for women's hair. They do have a female barber available upon request. The customer was told they need an appointment and left angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are: \n\n1. The policy is publicly stated, so the customer should be aware. If the customer didn't check the policy, maybe that's on them. But is it fair to enforce a policy that could be seen as discriminatory?\n\n2. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs. They mention they're Muslim and the rule about not touching women's hair unless family. However, the customer identifies as a man, so the staff's religious beliefs might conflict with serving someone they perceive as a woman. The customer's gender identity is a factor here. The staff might be uncomfortable due to religious rules, but the customer's self-identification as a man complicates this.\n\n3. The shop is willing to accommodate by booking the female barber if given notice. The customer didn't want to wait or book an appointment, leading to a conflict. The manager feels it's about respecting the employees' beliefs and providing proper service. The customer called them transphobic, which implies discrimination against transgender or non-binary individuals. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. If the customer is transgender and identifies as a man, then the policy of not serving them unless through a female barber could be seen as discriminatory. Even if the policy is in place for religious reasons, there might be legal requirements to accommodate customers regardless of gender identity. \n\nHowever, religious exemptions can sometimes be considered, but they might not override anti-discrimination laws. The shop's policy is based on the employees' religious beliefs, but if that policy leads to discrimination against a protected class (like transgender individuals), the shop could be in violation. \n\nThe manager is trying to balance religious freedom with equal service. The problem is that the customer's identity as male-passing but likely transgender means the shop's policy might be denying service based on gender identity, which is a protected class in many areas. \n\nSo, even though the policy is publicly stated, the enforcement of it in this case could be seen as discriminatory. The manager isn't wrong in enforcing their policy according to their beliefs, but if that policy leads to discrimination against a protected group, they might be in the wrong legally and morally. The author's response to the situation\u2014insisting on the appointment despite the customer's request\u2014could be perceived as transphobic because they're not offering the same service as a cisgender male customer. \n\nThe key here is whether the shop's policy infringes on the customer's rights. If the customer is a man (transgender) and the policy is based on the customer's perceived gender (which they pass as male), then the policy is not being applied here. However, the staff's discomfort is due to the customer's assigned gender at birth, which the customer may not identify with. \n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy may be discriminatory in this case, especially if the customer is a transgender man. The manager is in the wrong because they are enforcing a policy that denies service based on gender identity, which is illegal in many places. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
