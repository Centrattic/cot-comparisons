We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a manager at a barbershop that's mostly for men. They mention that they have a woman barber who works on an appointment basis. They advertise this policy on their signage, Facebook, and website. The shop is primarily Muslim, with varying degrees of strictness in their religious practices. The main issue here is a customer who identified as a male-passing woman wanted a haircut. The shop requires appointments for women, which is part of their policy because male staff aren't allowed to cut women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer was told they needed an appointment, but they left upset, calling the shop transphobic, sexist, etc. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. But the shop has a policy that's clear about requiring appointments for women, which is publicly stated. The customer in question is a male-passing woman, so perhaps they identified as male, but the shop's policy is based on gender as per their religious practices. There's a conflict here between the business's religious practices and the customer's gender identity.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The shop's policy is based on their religion, which they have the right to practice. However, the customer felt discriminated against. The key here is whether the shop's policy is inclusive of transgender individuals. Since they require appointments for women, but the customer is transitioning or identifies as female, but presents as male, how does the shop's policy address that? If the policy is based on gender assigned at birth, then the customer might be considered female, hence needing an appointment. But if the policy is based on how the customer presents, then maybe not. However, the shop's policy is about the customer's gender, not their gender identity, which can be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is that the shop isn't trained to handle women's haircuts, so they need the female barber for that. The customer wanted a men's style, but the shop's policy is about the customer's gender, not the type of cut. The author argues that it's about the staff's comfort and the tools/products needed. But if the customer is male-passing, maybe the tools and techniques are the same. However, the staff's religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair regardless of the cut style.\n\nThe shop stated their policy clearly, so the customer should have known beforehand. However, if the customer's gender identity is female, but they present as male, the shop might be denying service based on perceived gender rather than actual need. This could be seen as discrimination, especially if the shop is in a place where anti-discrimination laws protect gender identity.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they could call in the female barber with a couple of hours' notice, but the customer wasn't willing to wait. That part might be a bit of a red herring if the core issue is about the policy being applied regardless of the situation. The shop's refusal to provide service could still be considered discriminatory even if they have a workaround.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, businesses can claim religious exemptions, but that's not universal. If the shop is in a place where such exemptions are allowed, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the law requires equal service regardless of gender identity, then the shop is violating that law.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. Clear policy stated publicly.\n2. Religious reasons for the policy.\n3. Customer's gender identity vs. presentation.\n4. Legal protections against discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nIf the law protects against discrimination in service based on gender identity, then the shop is in the wrong. If not, then they might not be. The answer depends on the location's laws and how the policy is applied. However, the question is more about moral/ethical responsibility rather than legal, but the user might be looking for a general answer.\n\nConsidering that the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender (as per their policy) and the customer's gender identity is female, the shop might be denying service based on gender identity, which is a form of discrimination. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But if the policy is about the customer's physical presentation (e.g., how they appear), then it's different. However, since the customer is male-passing, they might not have appeared as female, complicating the issue.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy requires appointments for women because of the staff's religious beliefs. If the customer is male-passing, the shop might not have recognized them as female, but the customer identifies as female. The shop's policy is based on gender as per their rules, not the customer's self-identification. This could lead to a conflict.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intent and impact. The shop's intent is to follow their religious practices and protect staff comfort, but the impact is that a transgender person feels discriminated against. The balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination is a tough one, but in many places, anti-discrimination laws take precedence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
