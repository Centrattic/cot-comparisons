We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women and they don't have male barbers trained for women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women, which is stated on their website, Facebook, etc. They have a female barber available on appointment. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut but didn't book an appointment. The shop's policy isn't about the customer's gender but about the employee's comfort and training. The employees aren't trained in women's haircuts because of religious beliefs\u2014they aren't allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family.\n\nThe customer accused the shop of being transphobic or sexist. The manager argues that they need to protect employees' religious beliefs and provide proper service. The question is whether the manager is in the wrong.\n\nLegally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. If the policy is to require appointments for women but not men, that might be seen as discriminatory. Even if the reason is religious, the business might still have a duty to accommodate customers without violating their beliefs. However, there's a balance here. If the business can't provide service without violating their employees' religious practices, there's a conflict between anti-discrimination laws and religious freedom.\n\nBut in this case, the shop does have a female barber available. The manager could have offered to reschedule with the female barber if the customer provided a few hours' notice. However, the customer didn't want to wait and left angry. The manager might be in the wrong because the policy is applied based on the customer's gender, which could be discriminatory. The fact that they have a female barber available suggests that it's possible to serve women, but the policy isn't being applied consistently when a male-passing woman comes in. The manager's decision to enforce the policy based on perceived gender identity might be problematic, especially if the customer identifies as male but the shop's policy is based on biological sex, which could lead to confusion and discrimination claims.\n\nAnother angle: if the customer is a trans man, expecting to be treated as a man, but the shop's policy is based on biological sex, that could be transphobic. The manager's refusal could be seen as not recognizing the customer's identity. The shop's requirement for appointments for women might not apply if the customer identifies as a man, but the shop's policy is based on the customer's perceived gender, not their identification. This could lead to discrimination against transgender customers.\n\nOn the other hand, the employees' religious beliefs are also a factor. The shop isn't forcing employees to violate their religious practices. But the question is whether that justification is sufficient. In some jurisdictions, businesses can have religious exemptions, but others prioritize anti-discrimination laws for gender identity and sex.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager might be in the wrong because the policy is applied in a way that discriminates against transgender or gender non-conforming customers. Even though there's a religious justification, the business's policy and the way it was enforced could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that they have a female barber available but didn't use her in this case (due to the customer not having an appointment) might not be a valid reason if the customer was in the shop and could have been scheduled. Refusing service based on perceived gender without considering the customer's identity or providing an alternative could be problematic.\n"
