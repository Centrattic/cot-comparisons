We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (manager of a barbershop) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop only serves women by appointment, handled by the female barber. The shop's policy is stated online, and they have religious reasons for not cutting women's hair except by appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies. The shop clearly states their policy for women requiring appointments. The customer didn't book an appointment, so maybe the manager followed the policy correctly. But the customer identified as a male-passing woman, so maybe they expected the same service as a man. The manager argues that the policy is in place because of religious reasons and training for women's hair isn't provided. \n\nBut wait, the customer isn't female, they're a trans man or non-binary person who presents as male. So the shop's policy for women doesn't apply here. The manager might have confused gender identity with the customer's request. The policy is based on gender (women) but the customer isn't seeking service as a woman. So the manager's refusal might be based on incorrect assumptions. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy about not cutting women's hair due to religious reasons might not apply here. If the customer is male-presenting, the religious rule about touching women's hair doesn't come into play. The manager's employees were uncomfortable due to both religion and hair texture, but if the customer is male, that's irrelevant. \n\nThe customer was transphobic remarks thrown at them, but the shop's actions might have been transphobic by not providing service based on gender identity. The manager's policy is clear, but it's applied incorrectly in this case. The key issue is whether the policy discriminates against transgender or non-binary individuals by not considering their gender identity. \n\nIn many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. If the shop has a policy that excludes people based on perceived gender, that could be illegal. The manager might be in the wrong for not recognizing the customer's gender identity and enforcing a policy that inadvertently discriminates. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the policy failed to account for the customer's gender identity, leading to discrimination.\n"
