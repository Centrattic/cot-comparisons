We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author, who's a barber and manager, is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a non-binary or transgender customer who presents as male but the barbershop has a policy requiring appointments for women. The customer wanted a men's haircut and didn't want to make an appointment, but the shop only allows women to be served by the female barber, which isn't available on the day. The staff couldn't cut the customer's hair because of religious beliefs, and the customer accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The barbershop's policy is clear: they have a female barber who's contracted, and they require appointments for women. The customer is male-passing but the staff felt they couldn't cut their hair because of the religious rule about not touching women's hair unless family. The customer didn't want to wait for the female barber and left angry.\n\nSo, the main issues are: religious policies conflicting with customer service, potential discrimination against transgender or non-binary individuals, and whether the policy is applied fairly. The author's stance is that they have to follow their religious beliefs and also ensure proper service, hence the appointment system. The customer felt discriminated against.\n\nNow, under U.S. law, especially Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, religious accommodations are a factor, but places of public accommodation (like barbershops) are generally required to serve all customers unless there's a specific exemption. However, there's also the Equal Protection Clause and state laws regarding discrimination based on gender identity or sex. Some states have laws that protect against discrimination based on gender identity, which could apply here if the customer identifies as non-binary or transgender.\n\nThe barbershop's policy is that only women need appointments because the male barbers won't cut women's hair. But if the customer is a male-passing non-binary person, does that fall under \"women\" for the purpose of the policy? If the customer identifies as male, then the policy might not apply. However, the staff might not be able to determine the customer's gender identity and are acting based on appearance.\n\nThe staff's religious beliefs are important, but when they conflict with providing service to a customer, especially in a public accommodation, there's a potential legal issue. The shop is setting up a policy that could exclude transgender or non-binary individuals based on their appearance. If the customer is perceived as a woman, they have to wait for the female barber, but if they're perceived as a man, they can get a haircut. However, the staff's refusal is based on the assumption that the customer is a woman, which could lead to discrimination if the customer's gender identity doesn't align with the staff's perception.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy is communicated on their website and signs, so customers are aware. But if the policy effectively excludes transgender or non-binary individuals, that could be problematic. The question is whether the policy is discriminatory under state or federal laws. If the state where the shop operates has anti-discrimination laws that cover gender identity, then the shop's policy might be in violation.\n\nAdditionally, the staff's argument that they can't cut women's hair is based on religious beliefs, but public accommodations have to make reasonable accommodations unless it's a fundamental religious practice. However, there's a balance here. If the shop is a religious institution, there might be more leeway, but if it's a business open to the public, the requirement to serve all customers takes precedence.\n\nThe author is a manager, so they have a responsibility to manage employees' beliefs while also ensuring the business complies with anti-discrimination laws. The customer's claim of transphobia and sexism would depend on the specific circumstances and applicable laws. If the shop is in a state that doesn't protect against gender identity discrimination, maybe there's less liability, but in states that do, the shop could be in the wrong.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be seen as discriminatory if the policy leads to excluding transgender or non-binary customers based on their gender identity, even if the policy is based on religious beliefs. The key factors are the applicable anti-discrimination laws and whether the policy is being applied in a way that violates those laws.\n"
