We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop has a policy of requiring appointments for women due to religious reasons and the fact that they don't train staff in women's hair. The customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The shop has a policy stated on their signage and online that they have a female barber available by appointment. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The staff's reluctance is based on religious beliefs\u2014specifically, that they can't touch women's hair unless it's family. The shop also mentions that the female barber is contracted as needed, so the manager could have tried to accommodate with a few hours' notice. However, the customer didn't want to wait and left angry, accusing them of discrimination.\n\nNow, thinking about legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. If the shop is denying service to someone because they are a woman (or a trans man presenting as male), even if they state a policy, it could be seen as discriminatory. The shop's policy might be a way to avoid serving women, which could be legally problematic. Additionally, the shop is primarily Muslim, and their religious beliefs might be a defense, but in some jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't override anti-discrimination laws when it comes to public accommodations.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's gender identity. If the customer is a trans man or non-binary person who presents as male, the shop's policy might not account for that nuance. Requiring an appointment for women could inadvertently exclude people who don't fit traditional gender roles, leading to perceived transphobia. The shop's reasoning about hair texture and tools might be a stretch since hair is hair, regardless of the customer's gender. The staff's comfort is also a factor, but if that's based on religious beliefs, it's a personal belief versus a legal obligation to serve all customers unless there's a legitimate reason (which this might not be).\n\nThe shop's policy is clear, but the customer might not have known about the appointment requirement for women. If the shop didn't make it clear enough, that could be on them. Also, the manager could have tried to accommodate by contacting the female barber immediately, even if the customer was upset. However, the customer might not be willing to wait, so that's a trade-off.\n\nLegally, in many places, businesses are required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity. So the shop's refusal could be seen as discriminatory. Ethically, even if they have religious beliefs, the customer's right to service might take precedence. The shop could argue religious freedom, but that's a complex area. However, in public accommodations, anti-discrimination laws often override religious objections.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the shop's policy might be discriminatory and legally problematic. The manager might be in the wrong because they refused service based on gender, even if it's a policy they have in place. The customer's accusations of being transphobic and sexist could have some validity if the policy is applied without considering the individual's gender identity.\n"
