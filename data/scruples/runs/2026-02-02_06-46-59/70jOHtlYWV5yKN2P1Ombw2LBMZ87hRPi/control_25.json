We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a barber shop manager, mostly serving men, with a woman barber who's contracted for appointments. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but the shop had a policy of requiring appointments for women because the male barbers aren't trained in women's haircuts and also due to religious reasons\u2014specifically, not allowing men to touch women's hair unless it's family. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left. The author is asking if they're the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. If the shop is refusing service to someone who identifies as a woman (even if they pass as male), that could be a problem. Especially since the shop's policy might be seen as excluding transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals. \n\nThe shop has a policy stating they serve women via appointments, but the customer might not have known that. Also, the reasoning includes religious beliefs about men not touching women's hair, which could be a form of discrimination. The author mentions that they have a contract with a female barber, so maybe the issue is that they didn't make accommodations here. \n\nThe customer's argument was that they wanted a men's style, implying they could be served as a man. But if the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender, not the type of haircut, that might be problematic. The author might be relying on religious exemptions to justify the policy, but laws often protect against discrimination regardless of religious beliefs. \n\nAlso, the author's responsibility as a manager is to provide service to customers. If the female barber is available on appointment basis, maybe they should have been able to accommodate with a bit of notice, even if it took a couple of hours. The customer might not have wanted to wait or might not have known about the appointment system. \n\nOn the other hand, the shop's policies are clearly stated on their website and signage. The customer might have been responsible for checking those ahead of time. But in practice, people might not read all that, especially if they're in a hurry. \n\nEthically, it's about balancing religious freedom with anti-discrimination laws. However, in many jurisdictions, anti-discrimination laws take precedence, especially in public accommodations. So the author might be violating those laws by refusing service based on gender identity, even if their reasoning is religious. \n\nThe fact that the shop is primarily Muslim and the employees have varying levels of religious adherence complicates things. The author says they follow their parents' rule-abiding approach, but that doesn't necessarily override legal obligations. \n\nIn summary, the author's policy might be legally problematic, even if it's based on religious beliefs. The customer could be right in feeling discriminated against, and the shop's refusal without offering the appointment-based female barber might be in the wrong. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
