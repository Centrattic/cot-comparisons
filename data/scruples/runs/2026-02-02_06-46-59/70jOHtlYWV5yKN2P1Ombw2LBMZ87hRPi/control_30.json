We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber shop that's mostly for men, with a policy that requires women to have an appointment, and they have a female stylist they hire on contract. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The barbers didn't want to cut her hair because of religious reasons and the policy. The customer got upset and called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the question is about discrimination. The business is a private one, so they can set their own policies, but there might be legal implications depending on where they're located. In many places, refusing service based on gender identity could be a problem. The customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, but the shop's policy is based on biological sex? Wait, but the customer is a woman, so if the policy is for women to have appointments, then the customer should fall under that. But the shop's policy is for women, and the customer is a woman. But the customer is presenting as male, so maybe the barbers are unsure if they should treat her as a woman for the policy. But the core issue is that the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, which the customer doesn't want to do. But the customer is a woman, so maybe the shop is within their rights to enforce the policy, but the customer is challenging that. However, the real problem is the religious reason behind the policy. The shop's employees are Muslim, and they have a rule that men can't touch women's hair unless it's family. But the customer is a woman, so maybe the shop is not comfortable doing women's hair, even if the customer is presenting as male. But the customer is a woman, so the shop's policy is to use the female stylist. But the female stylist is on appointment basis. The customer didn't want to make an appointment, so the shop couldn't serve them. The customer then accused them of transphobia, etc. \n\nBut the key points here are: Is the shop's policy discriminatory? If the shop is open to the public, they might be required to serve all customers without discrimination. Refusing service based on gender identity could be illegal in some places. The shop's policy is based on biological sex, but the customer is a woman (gender-wise), so the shop's policy should apply to her regardless of how they present. However, the shop's reason for the policy is religious, but in many jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't override anti-discrimination laws. So if the shop is refusing service to a transgender customer because of their gender identity, that could be considered discrimination. \n\nThe author's defense is that they have a policy and they need to protect their employees' religious beliefs. But if the policy is applied in a way that denies service to someone based on their gender identity, that's problematic. The author is the manager, and they have a responsibility to serve all customers unless there's a valid reason. The fact that the customer is a woman (trans or cis) and the shop has a policy to require appointments for women means that the customer should be required to make an appointment. However, the shop's refusal is based on the employees' religious beliefs, not the policy itself. The policy is in place to ensure that women can be served, but in this case, the customer is a woman who doesn't want to make an appointment. \n\nSo the shop's policy is that women need appointments, but the customer is a woman who didn't want an appointment. The shop couldn't serve them because they didn't have the female stylist available without an appointment. The customer was upset because they didn't want to make an appointment and felt discriminated against. The shop's reasoning is that their employees can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, but the customer is a woman. So the shop is enforcing their policy, which is to use the female stylist for women, but the customer didn't want to follow the policy. The shop is not cutting the hair because they don't have the appropriate stylist available. \n\nHowever, in some places, this could be considered discrimination against transgender individuals if the policy is based on biological sex and not gender identity. The shop's policy might be in conflict with anti-discrimination laws if they refuse service to someone who is transgender. Additionally, the shop's explanation that they can't touch women's hair is based on religious beliefs, but that might not be a valid defense if the law protects against discrimination based on gender identity. \n\nSo, the author could be in the wrong if their policy and actions are considered discriminatory under the law. The fact that the customer was a woman (trans or cis) and the shop had a policy to require appointments for women might mean that the shop is applying the policy correctly, but the customer's gender identity might make the policy's application discriminatory. The key issue is whether the shop's policy is based on biological sex or gender identity, and how that interacts with local anti-discrimination laws. If the shop's policy is based on gender identity, then they might be required to serve the customer. If it's based on biological sex and the customer is a woman, then the policy is applied correctly, but if the customer is trans and the shop is using biological sex as the basis, that could be an issue. \n\nIn many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. So even if the policy is for women, if the customer is a woman (trans or cis), the shop can't refuse to serve them unless there's a legitimate business reason. The shop's reason here is their religious beliefs and the need to have a female stylist, but that might not be a valid business reason in the context of anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for refusing service based on the customer's gender identity, even if the shop has a policy in place. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
