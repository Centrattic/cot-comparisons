We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women, and the staff doesn't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer felt discriminated against and called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, refusing service based on gender identity or expression could be illegal. The customer is a woman who presents as male, so the shop's policy might be discriminatory under anti-discrimination laws. The business claims they only hire a female barber for women, but in this case, the staff wasn't comfortable cutting the customer's hair for religious reasons. However, requiring an appointment for women could be a policy that excludes transgender or non-binary individuals, which might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the shop's explanation about different hair textures and tools doesn't hold up if the customer is asking for a men's cut. The fact that they can't accommodate a woman wanting a men's haircut because of their religious beliefs might be seen as justifying discrimination. Plus, the staff being Muslim is a factor, but religious exemptions don't always override anti-discrimination laws. \n\nThe author mentions they were called transphobic, which the customer might feel justified in if the policy excludes them based on gender identity. The author might be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that unintentionally or intentionally discriminates against transgender or non-binary customers. Even if the intention was to follow religious practices, the law might require accommodations unless there's a specific exemption. \n\nBut wait, the shop does have a female barber they can call. The author says they needed a couple hours notice to bring her in. The customer didn't want to wait, leading to the conflict. If the shop can't provide the service without significant inconvenience, maybe that's a different angle. But the core issue is whether refusing service based on gender identity is permissible. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. So, if the customer is a woman (transgender or cisgender), the shop's policy of requiring appointments for women might be discriminatory. The author's stance that it's about the employees' comfort and religious beliefs might not be a valid defense if the law protects against discrimination. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they discriminated against a customer based on gender identity, even if it's under the guise of religious practices. The policy could be seen as excluding trans women from services they need, which is a form of discrimination. The answer might be A.\n"
