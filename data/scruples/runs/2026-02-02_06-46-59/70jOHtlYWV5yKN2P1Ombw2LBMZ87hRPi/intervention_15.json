We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber manager who's Muslim, and their shop has a policy where women need appointments because they have a female barber. They mention religious reasons for not cutting women's hair unless it's family. A customer who is a male-passing woman wanted a haircut but wasn't offered an appointment. They were told the policy applies to women and since the staff (all Muslim) isn't trained for women's hair, they couldn't serve her. The customer called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the user's policy is based on religious beliefs, which is their right. They also had a system in place to handle women's appointments. The customer, who identifies as a woman but presents as male, might have felt that their gender identity was being disregarded. The issue here is whether the policy unfairly discriminates based on gender identity. If the customer identifies as a woman, but the shop's policy is based on biological sex, that could be a conflict. However, the shop's policy is clear and stated publicly. They also mention that they can't serve women due to religious rules. \n\nBut wait, if the customer is a transgender woman, the policy might conflict with anti-discrimination laws. Many places now require service regardless of gender identity. By denying service based on the policy, the shop might be violating those laws. Even if the policy is based on religion, some jurisdictions may require accommodations for gender identity. However, the user is in a Muslim-majority country? Not sure. The user says they are Muslim, but the location isn't specified. In some countries, religious exemptions are allowed, but others don't allow discrimination based on gender identity. \n\nAlso, the customer might feel that their identity isn't recognized. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex, but the customer is a trans woman, then the policy could be seen as excluding transgender individuals. The user argues that they have a system to handle women's appointments, but the customer wasn't given the option, or didn't want to wait. The user might be in the right according to their policy and beliefs, but from a legal and social justice perspective, it could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThe user might not be in the wrong if their policy is legally permissible, but if it's against local laws, then they are. However, the question is about being in the wrong in terms of general ethics or social expectations, not just legal. Many people would argue that providing equal service regardless of gender identity is the right approach, so the author might be in the wrong from that standpoint. But if the shop's religious practices are protected, it's a gray area. The user is also considering employee comfort, which is valid, but there's a conflict between religious practices and customer rights. \n\nIn summary, the author is in a complex situation. Legally and ethically, depending on the jurisdiction, the answer could vary. But if we go by general social norms, denying service to someone based on gender identity (even if the policy is about biological sex) might be seen as wrong. So, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) if we prioritize non-discrimination based on gender identity. However, if the policy is strictly about religious practices and the customer is a cis woman, it's different. Since the customer is a male-passing woman (possibly trans), the policy's application is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
