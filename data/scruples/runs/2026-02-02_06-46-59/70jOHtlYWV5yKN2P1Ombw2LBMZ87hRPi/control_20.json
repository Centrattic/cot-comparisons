We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager in a predominantly Muslim establishment. They have a policy requiring appointments for women because male barbers aren't trained or allowed to cut women's hair due to religious reasons. They have a female barber on contract for women's appointments. A customer who is a male-passing woman comes in without an appointment, wants a men's style haircut. The staff isn't comfortable cutting their hair, so they decline. The customer gets upset, calls them transphobic, etc.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the policies and the customer's identity. The shop clearly states they require appointments for women, which is communicated on their website, etc. The customer, identifying as a male-passing woman, might not have known this policy or felt they should be exempt because they present as male. The staff's discomfort is due to both religious reasons (not touching women's hair) and lack of training. \n\nBut here's the thing: the customer is a woman, so according to their policy, they need an appointment. The staff isn't trained for women's haircuts, which is part of their policy. The customer might not have booked an appointment, leading to the refusal. However, the customer's gender identity and presentation complicate this. If the customer identifies as male, but presents as female, does the shop's policy apply? The shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived or stated. The customer might argue that since they wanted a men's style, they should be treated as a male customer. But the shop's policy is about the customer's gender, not the desired haircut style.\n\nThe staff's refusal could be seen as transphobic if they are being denied service based on their gender identity. However, the shop's policy is in place for all women, not specifically targeting transgender individuals. The problem is that the policy might not account for non-binary or transgender customers who don't fit the traditional male/female categories. By having a strict policy based on perceived gender without considering identity, the shop might inadvertently discriminate against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals.\n\nAdditionally, the shop's reason for the policy (religious reasons) could be a defense, but in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal regardless of the business's policies. So, even if the policy is well-intentioned, it might not hold up if it's applied in a way that harms transgender people. The customer's claim of being transphobic might stem from feeling excluded despite their identity not matching the policy's assumptions.\n\nSo, the author's stance might be justified based on the shop's stated policies and religious beliefs, but in practice, it could be seen as discriminatory. The key issue is whether the policy is applied in a way that respects everyone's gender identity. If the shop is not willing to accommodate transgender or non-binary individuals who don't need women's specific services, that could be problematic. The answer might depend on local laws and the specifics of the shop's policies. However, given that the customer is a woman (as per their own statement) and the policy applies to all women, the shop isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the policy doesn't account for gender identity, there's a case to be made that the shop is discriminatory. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if the policy is consistently applied to all women, regardless of their gender identity, and if the shop offers an alternative (like the female barber). However, if the policy fails to consider gender identity, then there could be issues. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong given the existing policies, but there's a nuance here that could go either way.\n"
