We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a barber shop manager) is at fault for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who came in without an appointment, and the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because of religious reasons. The shop only has one female barber who works on contract and is called in for appointments.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clearly stated on their website, Facebook, and signs. That's important because they're transparent about not serving women without appointments. The customer might not have known about the policy, but the shop made it public, so maybe they should have checked beforehand. However, if the customer presented as male, maybe they expected to be served like any other male customer.\n\nThe shop's employees are primarily Muslim, and the religious belief here is that male employees can't cut women's hair unless it's family. This is a genuine religious practice. The shop isn't trained in women's hair, which complicates things even if they tried. Also, the manager mentions that they need to consider the comfort and beliefs of their employees. Forcing employees to cut a woman's hair would violate their religious principles, which is a significant ethical consideration.\n\nThe customer was upset and accused the shop of being transphobic or sexist. But the shop's policy isn't about gender identity per se\u2014it's about gender in the context of religious rules. Since the customer is a woman (even if passing as male), the policy applies. The shop also tried to explain the reason behind the policy, which is about service quality and religious compliance, not discrimination against trans people.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If the customer identifies as male but is biologically female, the shop's policy might inadvertently exclude them. The shop's policy is based on biological sex as stated, which could be a point of contention. But the shop's reasoning is tied to their religious practices and the need for a female barber. They also offer the same price but require notice for the female barber, so there's an option, just with an appointment.\n\nThe manager did feel bad about the situation but had to balance employee comfort and service quality. The customer's reaction was to storm out and call the shop names, which suggests a misunderstanding or unwillingness to accept the policy. The shop's transparency is on their side, but the situation could be seen as excluding a trans person if they present as male. However, the shop's policy isn't targeting trans individuals but rather adhering to religious guidelines and operational constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy is based on clear, stated reasons and religious beliefs, and they provide an alternative (appointments with the female barber). The manager isn't at fault for enforcing the policy as written, even if it leads to a conflict with a customer who didn't meet the criteria. The key factors are transparency, religious freedom, and employee rights to adhere to their beliefs. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
