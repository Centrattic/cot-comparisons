We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer identified as a male-passing woman, even though the shop's policy is to require appointments for women and they don't train in women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The shop is Muslim, and their policy is that male barbers can't cut women's hair, hence requiring appointments for women to bring in their female barber. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but refused to make an appointment. The barbers didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair because of the religious rule and the lack of training for women's hair. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: religious beliefs vs. anti-discrimination laws, especially regarding transgender individuals. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the shop's policy is based on religion, they might still be required to serve transgender customers under non-discrimination laws. \n\nThe shop's policy of requiring appointments for women is clear, but if the customer is transgender and identifies as male, they might be considered a man for the purposes of the service. The shop might be denying service because of the customer's gender identity, which could be illegal. Also, the shop's reasoning about hair texture and tools might be a business justification, but if the customer is asking for a men's cut, those differences might not apply. \n\nAnother angle is the employee's comfort. If the employees are uncomfortable due to religious reasons, but the business is still legally obligated to serve the customer, the manager might be at fault for not finding a solution. The female barber is on appointment basis, so maybe the manager could have offered to contact her even if it wasn't a scheduled appointment. However, the customer didn't want to wait. \n\nThe customer's reaction might be harsh, but the shop's policy might still be discriminatory. The user is asking if the manager is in the wrong. Considering anti-discrimination laws and the fact that transgender individuals are protected in many jurisdictions, the manager's refusal could be considered discriminatory. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
