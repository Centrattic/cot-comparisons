We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is a barber shop manager, part of a majority Muslim team. They have a policy that women need appointments because they have a female barber who works on contract. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut without an appointment. The manager refused because their policy requires appointments for women, and the male barbers can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies in place. The shop clearly states their policy on their website and signs. So, the customer should have been aware. But wait, the customer identified as male-passing, so maybe they didn't see themselves as a woman. The shop's policy is based on gender for women, but if the customer presents as male, does that fall under the women's policy? The manager might have applied the policy strictly based on the customer's gender identity or presentation. However, the shop's policy is about serving women, so if the customer is a woman (biologically or identifies as such), they need an appointment. If they're male-passing, they might not be considered under the women's policy. But the situation is complicated because the customer might have a gender identity that doesn't align with their biological sex.\n\nThe shop's religious practices require male barbers not to cut women's hair except family, so they don't train on women's hair. The female barber is contracted. The customer wanted a men's cut but was told they needed an appointment. The manager's reasoning is that the policy isn't for customers but for the shop's operational needs. However, the customer felt it was discrimination. \n\nLegally, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity or expression is prohibited. If the shop refuses service based on gender identity, that could be a legal issue. The shop might be seen as transphobic if they treat someone differently because of their gender identity, even if their policy is based on biological sex. Also, the shop's policy might not account for non-binary or trans individuals. \n\nThe manager's intention was to follow the shop's policy and protect employees' religious beliefs. But the customer's experience was negative, leading to accusations. The key points are whether the policy is discriminatory and if the shop considered alternative solutions, like adjusting the appointment system for gender-diverse customers. The manager might argue they followed their policy, but the policy itself could be problematic if it excludes people based on gender identity. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the shop's policy is based on biological sex without considering gender identity, and that leads to discrimination, then they might be in the wrong. However, if the policy is clearly stated and the customer should have known, maybe not. But in many jurisdictions, businesses can't discriminate against trans or gender non-conforming individuals. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because their policy could be seen as discriminatory against trans or non-binary people.\n"
