We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who got in a situation where a customer, a male-passing woman, wanted a haircut but wasn't given one because the shop only allows women to be served by the contracted female barber. The shop's policies are based on religious reasons, specifically Muslim beliefs about not touching women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. If the customer identifies as a woman and wants a haircut, the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory. Even if they state their policy in advance, it doesn't necessarily protect them if the customer feels excluded because of their gender identity.\n\nThe customer was told they can't be served because of the shop's religious practices. But religious exemptions don't always override anti-discrimination laws, especially when it comes to public accommodations. The shop might be required to serve everyone regardless of gender identity, even if their beliefs conflict with that.\n\nThen there's the part about the shop not training in women's hair due to religion, which complicates things. However, the key point is that the customer was denied service based on perceived gender, which could be a problem. The shop's policy might be considered transphobic if it's based on the customer's gender expression rather than their actual need for a female barber.\n\nThe employee's comfort level is mentioned, but that's more about the staff's beliefs. However, businesses can't use staff discomfort as a reason to deny service to customers. The shop should have arranged to bring in the contracted female barber, as they mention they can do with notice.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if discrimination laws apply, they might be. From a social standpoint, the customer's experience of being bullied or transphobic is a valid concern. The shop's policy is clear, but the customer might not have known or understood the nuances, leading to frustration.\n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because the shop's policy could be seen as discriminatory, even if based on religious reasons. The key is whether the shop can be legally and ethically required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity, which many places do require.\n"
