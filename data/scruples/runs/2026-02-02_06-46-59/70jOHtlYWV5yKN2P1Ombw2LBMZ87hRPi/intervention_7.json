We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the barber manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women and they can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The barbershop has a policy stated publicly that they have one female barber on appointment. They can't cut women's hair because of religious beliefs\u2014specifically, Muslim employees are not allowed to cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer identified as male-passing but is a woman seeking a men's cut. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair, so they couldn't serve them. The customer felt it was transphobic and sexist, leading to an argument.\n\nThe main issue here seems to be the intersection of religious policies and discrimination. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, but does that override the customer's rights? The customer might argue that they're being discriminated against based on gender identity, even though the policy is about biological sex. The shop claims they require appointments for women to provide proper service, but in this case, the customer identified as male-passing, which complicates the policy application.\n\nI should consider legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the policy is religious, there might be anti-discrimination laws that take precedence. The shop's policy could be seen as excluding transgender individuals, which is a form of discrimination. Additionally, the fact that they have a female barber available on appointment might not be sufficient if the customer can't wait or is in a hurry.\n\nAnother angle is the shop's responsibility to accommodate all customers. If the customer's gender identity is male-passing, the policy based on biological sex might not be appropriate. The shop's refusal could be seen as not adjusting their policy to include transgender individuals, thereby treating them differently. \n\nHowever, the shop's religious freedom is a defense. In some jurisdictions, religious exemptions might protect such policies, but there's a conflict with anti-discrimination laws. The balance between these two rights is tricky. \n\nAlso, the staff's comfort and training: the shop doesn't train in women's hair due to religious reasons. If the customer is presenting as male, maybe the staff's discomfort is unfounded. The shop's policy might not account for gender identity, leading to a misunderstanding or misapplication of their rules.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the shop is prioritizing their religious beliefs and employee comfort over the customer's access to services. The customer felt bullied and transphobic, which could be valid if the shop didn't make an effort to accommodate or at least offer alternatives.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the shop's policy may not account for gender identity, leading to discrimination against transgender customers. Even if the policy is religiously based, it might not be exempt from anti-discrimination laws. The author's refusal could be seen as in the wrong because they didn't adapt their policy to include transgender individuals, leading to a negative experience for the customer.\n"
