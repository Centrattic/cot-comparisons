We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a barbershop that mainly serves men but has a policy requiring appointments for women, using a contracted female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut without an appointment. The staff refused because of religious reasons and the appointment system. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the barbershop's policy is stated on their website and signage, so they're upfront about serving women by appointment only. They have a female barber who can be called in when needed. The staff's religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair except for family, so they don't train in women's haircuts. The customer, who identifies as male-passing but is a woman, wanted a men's style but didn't want to wait for an appointment. The staff refused, leading to the customer getting upset and labeling them as bigoted.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspects, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity or expression is prohibited. Even if the shop's policy is to only serve women by appointment, if the customer is a woman (or gender non-conforming person presenting as male-passing), the policy might be seen as discriminatory. The shop's religious beliefs might not be a valid defense here because laws often protect against discrimination in public accommodations, regardless of religion. For example, in the U.S., Title VII and other anti-discrimination laws can apply to businesses open to the public.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy requires advance notice for women, which could be a barrier for someone who doesn't identify as a woman. If the customer is a woman in a male-presenting way, they might feel the policy is sexist. Alternatively, if the customer is transgender and not yet fully transitioned, the shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic. The shop's refusal based on gender and religious beliefs might conflict with anti-discrimination laws that protect gender identity and expression.\n\nThe key points are whether the shop's policy violates anti-discrimination laws by refusing service based on gender identity or expression. If the shop's policy is to serve women by appointment only, but the customer identifies as a woman (even if passing as male), the shop might be in violation. Additionally, the staff's religious beliefs might not override the legal obligation to serve all customers without discrimination.\n\nAnother angle is accessibility and the shop's responsibility to accommodate diverse needs. By requiring appointments, they might be excluding people who can't schedule in advance. The customer's frustration is understandable if they felt they were being denied service based on their gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy may be discriminatory under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that could be seen as sexist or transphobic, even if their intention was to comply with religious practices.\n"
