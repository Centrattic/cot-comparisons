We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a barber shop that primarily serves men but has a policy requiring appointments for women because they have one contracted female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs\u2014specifically, Muslim staff not cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer felt they were being transphobic or sexist and left upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the policy based on religion and the customer's gender identity. The shop is clear about their policy on their website and signage, which is a good thing. They mention that they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs and that they require appointments to bring in the female contractor. The customer, who identifies as a man (or male-passing), wanted a men's cut but was told they needed an appointment. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair, so they couldn't proceed.\n\nNow, considering that the shop is transparent about their policy, maybe they aren't wrong for having it. But there's a conflict here between their religious practices and the customer's access to services. The customer might feel that their gender presentation (as male) should override the policy, but the shop's policy is about the customer's assigned gender at birth or legal gender? If the policy is strictly for biological women, then a trans man (assigned female at birth) might still be considered a woman under their policy. That could be an issue because the customer is trans and identifies as male, but the shop's policy is based on the customer's sex. \n\nAlso, the shop is serving people of all sorts, including non-Muslims, so they might be in a public accommodation setting where discrimination is not allowed. In many places, businesses can't deny service based on gender identity or sex. If the shop's policy is excluding trans men or non-binary people who are assigned female at birth, that might be a problem. \n\nThe shop manager mentions that they can't train staff in women's hair because of religion. That seems like a policy that could be challenged. There might be accommodations they can make, like the female contractor, but if the customer is being denied service because they don't fit into the appointment system, maybe the shop is not providing equal service. \n\nThe customer was called transphobic, etc., which is a strong accusation. The shop says they are trying to protect their employees' religious beliefs. However, in many jurisdictions, businesses must allow trans people to be served without discrimination. So the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws if they're refusing service to someone based on their gender identity, even if it's under the guise of religious accommodation.\n\nSo, balancing the religious freedom of the employees against the customer's right to equal service, it's a tricky situation. But in many cases, public accommodations can't deny service based on religious beliefs if it leads to discrimination against protected classes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because refusing service to a trans man who is male-passing and wants a men's cut could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that they have a female contractor available but can't accommodate due to appointment policies might not be a valid excuse if the law requires them to serve everyone regardless.\n"
