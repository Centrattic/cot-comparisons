We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a barber shop where they primarily serve men, and they have a policy that women need appointments because they only have a female barber available on a contract basis. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The staff didn't want to cut her hair because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, the belief that male barbers shouldn't touch women's hair unless it's family. The customer got upset, accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left in a huff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can have certain policies, but they must not discriminate based on protected characteristics like gender identity. The question is whether the policy of not cutting women's hair (or non-binary individuals who present as male) is a form of discrimination. The business is stated to be primarily Muslim, and their religious beliefs are part of the reason for the policy. But there's a tension between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws.\n\nIn the US, for example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act allows religious organizations to have policies based on religion, but if the business isn't a religious organization per se, then they might still be required to accommodate customers regardless of religion. However, if they are a religious organization, they might have more leeway. The scenario mentions they are primarily Muslim but serve all sorts of customers, so it's unclear if the business is a religious institution. \n\nThe customer here is a transgender or non-binary person who is male-passing and wants a men's haircut. The staff is refusing service based on the customer's gender, even though the customer is presenting as male. The policy is that women need appointments, but the customer might not identify as a woman. The staff's refusal could be seen as discrimination based on gender identity. \n\nAlso, the business claims they have a policy in place to accommodate women by requiring appointments, but the customer is in a grey area. If the customer is a trans man, then the policy that requires women to book appointments might not apply. The staff might be misgendering the customer, leading to the refusal of service. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in some jurisdictions, gender identity is protected, and refusing service based on that could be illegal. Even if the business is citing religious beliefs, there's a limit to how far religious exemptions can go, especially when they conflict with anti-discrimination laws. \n\nEthically, it's about balancing religious freedom with the right to non-discrimination. The business is trying to accommodate their employees' religious beliefs, but at the same time, they're denying service to a customer who may not identify as the gender they're being categorized under. The customer's experience is being negatively affected, and the business is being accused of transphobia, which is a serious charge.\n\nThe author might argue that they're following their policies and respecting their employees' beliefs, but if those policies are discriminatory, then they could be in the wrong. The key points are: the customer's gender identity, the business's policy based on religious beliefs, and the potential legal implications of refusing service based on that policy. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the refusal to serve a customer who is male-passing, especially if they are transgender or non-binary, may constitute discrimination. The policy seems to be based on a binary gender concept that doesn't account for non-binary or transgender individuals, and the business's stance could be seen as not accommodating the customer's identity, leading to discrimination.\n"
