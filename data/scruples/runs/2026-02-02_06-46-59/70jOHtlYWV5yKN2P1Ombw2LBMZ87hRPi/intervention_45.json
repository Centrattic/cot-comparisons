We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a man's style haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, as they only have one female barber who works on an appointment basis. The shop's staff is primarily Muslim, and there's a religious rule against men touching women's hair unless they're family. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left in a huff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's policies. They clearly state that they require appointments for women, which is communicated through their website, Facebook, etc. The customer might not have checked these details, but the shop is up front. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts because of religious beliefs, so when a woman comes in without an appointment, they can't serve her. The customer in question identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. However, the shop's policy is about gender, not gender identity. If the customer is a woman (as per legal definition) but presents as male, does the policy apply? The shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their appointment system, which requires appointments for women. So if the customer is a woman, even if they pass as male, the policy would still require an appointment. But the customer might not have realized this. The shop tried to explain but the customer didn't accept it. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint in many places, businesses can have religious exemptions, but there's also anti-discrimination laws. However, if the business is clear about their policies and limitations, they might not be in violation. The shop is offering a service (women's haircuts) through their female barber on appointments, which is a way to accommodate their religious beliefs. The staff isn't comfortable cutting women's hair, so they have a system in place to ensure women can be served by the female barber. The issue here is whether the shop is denying service based on gender identity or not. The customer is a woman who presents as male, but legally, gender is determined by birth certificate or self-identification, depending on the jurisdiction. If the shop is using a policy based on the customer's self-identification, they might be violating anti-discrimination laws. However, if the policy is based on the customer's legal gender, then it's different. \n\nBut the shop's policy is about the customer's gender as per their appointment system. If the customer is a woman (as per their legal gender), even if they pass as male, the appointment system is meant for women. So the shop is not denying service based on gender identity but on the appointment system. The customer might be mistaken about the policy. The shop is also considering their employees' religious beliefs, which is a valid reason under certain laws. However, there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination. The shop is providing an alternative (appointments with the female barber), so they aren't completely denying service but redirecting. The customer is upset and called them names, but the shop is following their policy. \n\nSo, the key points are: clear policy communicated, alternative service available via appointments, employees' religious beliefs respected, and the customer's misunderstanding. The shop isn't directly denying service but can't provide the on-the-spot service. Whether the shop is in the wrong depends on whether their policy is discriminatory. If the policy is based on gender (as per the appointment system) and they offer an alternative, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the policy is based on gender identity and not the customer's legal gender, that's a problem. The customer is a woman (legally) who identifies as male but passes, so the shop's policy might be problematic if it's based on how the customer presents rather than their legal gender. But the shop's policy is about appointments for women, not about gender identity. If the customer is a woman (as per legal terms), the policy applies. If they're trans, but legally identified as female, the policy still applies. \n\nSo, the shop is following their policy, which is clear. The customer didn't book an appointment, so the shop can't serve them. The employees are uncomfortable due to religious beliefs, but the shop is managing that by having an appointment system. Therefore, the shop isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
