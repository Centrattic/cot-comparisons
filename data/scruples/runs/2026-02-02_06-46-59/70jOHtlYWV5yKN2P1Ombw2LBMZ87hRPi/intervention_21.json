We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a barber who refused to cut a customer's hair, citing their policy of requiring appointments for women and the religious rules about not cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut.\n\nFirst, the barbershop's policy is stated on their website, Facebook, and signage. They have a female barber available by appointment, so they do serve women, just not on the same terms as men. The author mentions that their religion prohibits them from cutting women's hair, which is why they require appointments. The staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nThe customer argued that since they wanted a men's style, it shouldn't matter. However, the staff was uncomfortable due to religious rules and the differences in hair texture and tools. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, sexist, etc., and left. The author feels bad but is concerned about employee comfort and service quality.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can have policies based on gender, but there are anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits gender discrimination by employers. However, religious exemptions might apply if the policy is based on religious beliefs. But the customer's gender identity complicates this. The customer is a trans man, which could fall under different considerations. The author's policy might clash with anti-discrimination laws, especially if the customer is perceived as male but the business is using gender-based policies.\n\nEthically, the situation is tricky. The business is transparent about their policy, which might not be discrimination if they serve women by appointment. However, refusing service to a trans man who presents as male could be seen as discriminatory. The argument that they can't serve women due to religious reasons doesn't necessarily apply to a trans man, depending on how they identify. The staff's discomfort is valid, but the business might be responsible for providing alternative solutions, like the female barber, even if it requires more notice.\n\nThe author's policy might be in line with their religious beliefs, but if it leads to excluding trans individuals who identify as the gender they present as, it could be problematic. The key is whether the refusal is based on the customer's gender identity or the biological sex. If the business is using a policy that's based on perceived biological sex rather than gender identity, that could be an issue in jurisdictions where gender identity is protected.\n\nIn summary, the author's position is rooted in religious and business policies, but those policies might conflict with anti-discrimination laws, especially regarding trans individuals. The answer depends on local laws and how gender identity is protected. However, since the author's policy is publicly stated and they do offer a solution (appointments with the female barber), some might argue they're not in the wrong. Others might see it as discriminatory regardless of the policy. But considering the transphobic accusations, the author's approach might not account for the customer's gender identity, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
