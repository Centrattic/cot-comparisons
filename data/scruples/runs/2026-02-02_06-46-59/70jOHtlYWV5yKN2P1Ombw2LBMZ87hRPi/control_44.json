We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the barber shop manager) is at fault for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have female barbers on staff due to religious reasons. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop's policy is stated publicly on their website, social media, etc., that they have a female barber available by appointment. The customer came in without an appointment, and the manager explained the policy. The customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the shop's refusal to cut the customer's hair is discriminatory. The author mentions that their religious beliefs prevent male employees from cutting women's hair, hence the appointment system for women. However, the customer identified as a man but is a trans man or non-binary, passing as male. \n\nIn many places, discrimination laws protect against gender identity and expression. If the shop is refusing service based on gender identity, even if they claim it's for religious reasons, that could be a problem. However, some regions do allow for religious exemptions. The key is whether the policy is applied consistently. The shop has a policy for women, which the customer in question is presenting as a man but is female-assigned-at-birth. The shop's policy might be based on gender as assigned at birth rather than gender identity, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, the shop's reasoning includes not being trained for women's hair and using different products. But if the customer is passing as male, maybe the shop's policy isn't considering gender identity. This could lead to discrimination claims. However, the shop's policy is clear and public, so maybe the customer was warned. \n\nAnother angle: the shop isn't refusing service to women entirely; they just require appointments. But if the customer is in a gender that the shop's policy restricts due to religious reasons, and that policy isn't accommodating gender identity, it's a conflict. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws if they don't adjust their policy to consider gender identity beyond just biological sex.\n\nBut the shop's stance is that they can't cut women's hair, regardless of gender identity, due to religious beliefs. However, in many jurisdictions, businesses can't cite religious exemptions to discriminate against protected classes like gender identity. So the author might be in the wrong because their policy is based on sex (biological) and doesn't account for gender identity, leading to discrimination against transgender or non-binary customers.\n\nBut wait, if the shop's policy is to require appointments for women (as in biological sex), and the customer is a trans man (biologically female), they might still fall under the policy. However, if the shop doesn't adjust their policy to include gender identity, that could be problematic. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because refusing service to someone based on their gender identity, even if they pass as male, could be seen as discriminatory. The shop's policy might not be inclusive enough, and they failed to accommodate the customer's needs while adhering to anti-discrimination laws.\n"
