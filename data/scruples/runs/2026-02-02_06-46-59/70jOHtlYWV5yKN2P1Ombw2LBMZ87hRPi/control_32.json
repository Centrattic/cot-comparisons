We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is a barber and manager at a shop that primarily serves men but has a policy of requiring appointments for women because they have a female barber they contract. They had a customer who is a male-passing woman come in wanting a haircut, but since the appointment system is for women, they had to refer her to the female barber. She got upset and accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the shop's policy based on religious beliefs and the customer's identity. The shop states clearly on their website and social media that women need appointments, which is to bring in the contracted female barber. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, and the female barber isn't there unless scheduled. The customer, who is a trans man or non-binary person, might not have known the policy applies to them because they present as male. \n\nNow, the user's stance is that they need to protect their employees' comfort and the service quality. The customer, however, felt discriminated against. Legally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is for women, if the customer identifies as male or non-binary, the policy might not apply, but the shop's policy is based on the customer's assigned gender at birth? Or does it apply to anyone presenting as female? The way the policy is written might be problematic if it's not clear. \n\nAlso, the shop's refusal is based on the gender of the customer, not the type of service. Even if the customer wants a men's style, the staff's religious beliefs prevent them from cutting their hair. That could be seen as discrimination against trans or non-binary individuals. \n\nThe user did mention they had the female barber available on appointment. But the customer might not have known they needed to schedule her even though they pass as male. The signage doesn't specify about gender identity. So the policy, as communicated, might not be inclusive. \n\nReligious exemptions vary by region. Some places allow businesses to cite religious beliefs to avoid certain anti-discrimination laws, but others don't. The user's location isn't specified, which is a big factor. If they're in a place where discrimination against trans people is illegal, then the policy could be violating the law. \n\nAdditionally, the term \"male-passing woman\" is a bit confusing. If the customer identifies as a woman but presents masculinely, the policy is still in place for women, so the barber would need to schedule the female employee. But if the customer is a trans man who hasn't transitioned legally yet, the policy might not account for that. \n\nThe user's reasoning is about employee comfort and service quality. However, refusing service based on the customer's gender identity without accommodations could be discriminatory. The shop could be required to provide a service regardless of the employee's comfort if it's a public accommodation. \n\nSo, even though the shop has a policy, applying it in a way that denies service to someone based on their transgender status might be in the wrong. The user should consider updating their policy to be more inclusive and provide training or accommodations for trans customers. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
