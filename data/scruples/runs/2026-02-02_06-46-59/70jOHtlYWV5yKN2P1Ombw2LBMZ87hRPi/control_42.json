We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who refused to cut a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, and they don't have a female barber available on the day. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the policy is that women need appointments because the shop mostly serves men and only has a female barber available by appointment. The customer identified as a male-passing woman, so they might not have wanted to book the female barber's appointment. The manager explains that the male barbers aren't trained in women's hair due to religious reasons. \n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. The customer is a woman who is male-passing, so by requiring her to book an appointment with the female barber, they might be enforcing a policy that could be seen as discriminatory. The argument is that the policy is for all women, not targeting trans individuals, but the effect might still be discrimination. \n\nThe shop's reasoning is about employee comfort and training. However, denying services based on gender identity could be illegal, especially if the business is open to the public. Plus, the customer was denied service based on their gender, which might be against anti-discrimination laws. \n\nAlso, the policy being stated on their website and signage might not protect them if it's seen as excluding certain groups. The manager might be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that leads to discrimination, even if the intention was to follow religious practices. However, there's also a point about employee comfort, but that's a different issue. \n\nSo, weighing it all, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they denied service based on gender identity, which could be discriminatory, even if the policy is for all women. The key is whether the policy is applied in a way that violates anti-discrimination laws. The fact that the customer was transphobic and sexist accusations might indicate the customer felt targeted, which could imply the shop's policy had a discriminatory effect.\n"
