We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men and has a policy requiring appointments for women because they have a contracted female barber. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut, but the staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons (they can't touch women's hair unless it's family) and lack of training. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. The barbershop's policy might inadvertently exclude transgender or non-binary individuals who are perceived as male but identify as female, or vice versa. The US, for example, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, considers discrimination against transgender individuals as sex discrimination.\n\nThen there's the contractual aspect. The shop states they serve all customers, which implies inclusivity. Their policy might be conflicting with that statement. Even if they have a contracted female barber, the refusal to accommodate because of religious beliefs might not override anti-discrimination laws. The shop's religion could be a factor, but it's not clear if that's a protected class in this context. However, businesses can't use religious exemptions to discriminate against others.\n\nThe argument from the barbershop is about employee comfort and training. But that seems like a business policy that could be challenged. They should be able to either train all employees to handle women's hair regardless of religious beliefs or ensure that when a woman comes in, the female barber is available. Alternatively, they might need to revise their policies to avoid discrimination.\n\nThe customer is a male-passing woman, which complicates things. If the customer is transgender, the situation could be more sensitive. The barbershop's policy might not account for gender identity versus gender expression. The customer might not be able to book an appointment in advance because they identify as a woman or present as non-binary, expecting to be served like any other customer.\n\nThere's also the ethical side. Even if the shop's intention is to comply with religious beliefs, they could be seen as excluding a group of people. The argument about different hair textures and tools could be a way to justify the policy, but that might not hold if the customer is requesting a men's cut style. However, the shop's employees aren't trained in women's hair, so they can't provide the service regardless of the customer's request.\n\nThe key points here are: the shop's policy, their stated services, legal obligations, and the customer's experience. The shop might have a policy, but if it leads to discrimination against a protected group, they could be in the wrong. The employees' discomfort is a business management issue that the shop should address, perhaps by providing training or ensuring the female barber is available when needed.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy might be discriminatory, especially towards transgender or non-binary individuals, which could make the author at fault. The refusal to accommodate despite the ability to book the female barber in advance, combined with the shop's public statements of serving all customers, likely places the author in the wrong under discrimination laws.\n"
