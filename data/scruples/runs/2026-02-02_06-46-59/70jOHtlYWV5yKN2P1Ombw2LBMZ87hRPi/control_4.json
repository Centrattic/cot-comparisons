We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (manager of a Muslim barbershop) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and they require appointments for women due to religious reasons and training.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The barbershop has a policy that they're primarily for men, with a female barber available by appointment. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. The manager couldn't serve them because the staff wasn't trained or comfortable with women's hair, and they had a religious policy against non-family female haircuts. The customer felt it was transphobic and sexist.\n\nNow, considering the law: In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the policy is based on religious beliefs, there might be legal obligations to serve all customers equally. The barbershop's policy might conflict with anti-discrimination laws. Also, the customer's gender identity (male-passing) might mean they should be treated as a male customer under their policy. However, the barbershop's stance is that they don't serve women, but the customer doesn't identify as female. \n\nReligious exemptions are tricky. Courts sometimes allow them but often side with anti-discrimination laws in public accommodations. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop said that refusing service for same-sex weddings could be considered discrimination, not just based on religion. So, if the customer is male-identifying, the barbershop might still be obligated to serve them regardless of their policy for women.\n\nThe manager's argument is about employee comfort and training. But forcing employees to follow a policy that might require them to touch women's hair could be an issue. However, if the customer doesn't identify as female, the policy might not apply. The manager could have offered to check if the female barber was available without the appointment, but they needed notice. The customer was upset and left, accusing them of transphobia.\n\nAlso, the barbershop's policy is publicly stated, but if it leads to discrimination against transgender individuals, that's problematic. The manager might not be considering that the customer's gender identity is male, so the policy shouldn't apply. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the law isn't clear, from a social justice standpoint, denying service based on perceived gender could be seen as discriminatory. The manager might be conflating the customer's biological sex with their gender identity, which is a common issue in transphobic policies.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is likely in the wrong because the policy as applied to the customer is discriminatory against a transgender individual. The religious exemption doesn't override legal and ethical obligations to serve all customers without discrimination. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
