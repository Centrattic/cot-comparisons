We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they own a barbershop where the majority of customers are men, and they have a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have enough female staff who can cut women's hair due to religious reasons. A customer who identifies as a male-passing woman came in and wanted a man's haircut but didn't have an appointment. The author refused, explaining the policy, and the customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. Even if they have a religious exemption, there might be a conflict here. The shop's policy is to require appointments for women, but the customer identifies as a woman. The customer might argue that the policy is discriminatory because they are a woman and being denied service based on that. However, the shop claims they have religious reasons for not having male staff cut women's hair. \n\nBut then, there's the issue of the customer being male-passing. If the customer is transgender and presents as male, does the shop's policy apply? The customer is asking for a men's cut, so maybe they should be treated like any other male customer. The shop's policy is based on the customer's gender, which could be problematic if the customer's gender identity is female but they pass as male. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nAlso, the shop mentions that they have a female barber available on appointment. If the customer had made an appointment, they could have been served. But the customer didn't have one, so the shop couldn't provide the service. However, the customer might not have known about the policy or felt they should have to schedule in advance just because of their gender. \n\nThe shop's reasoning includes religious beliefs about not touching women's hair, which is part of some interpretations of Islam. However, laws in many countries prioritize anti-discrimination laws over religious exemptions. For example, in the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act allows for religious accommodations, but there's a limit when it comes to discrimination based on gender identity. \n\nMoreover, the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory against women regardless of the religious aspect. By requiring appointments for women, they might be effectively limiting their service to women, which could be considered unequal treatment. Even if the intention is to provide better service with their female barber, the policy itself could be problematic.\n\nThe customer's reaction is strong, but the shop manager feels they had to protect their employees' comfort and ensure proper service. However, the employees' discomfort due to religious beliefs isn't a valid reason to deny service to a customer based on their gender. Employees can be trained or accommodations can be made, but if the policy is in place to prevent employees from violating their religious beliefs, that might be a different issue. Still, the law typically requires businesses to serve all customers regardless of the employees' personal beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy as applied in this case seems to be discriminatory against the customer's gender identity, even if the intention was to comply with religious practices. The fact that they have a female barber available on appointment suggests they can provide the service, but the customer was denied because of their gender, which could be seen as wrong.\n"
