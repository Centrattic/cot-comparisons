We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a barber shop that primarily serves men, with a policy requiring appointments for women to be served by their female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who didn't have an appointment and was denied a haircut. \n\nFirst, the barbershop's policy is clear: they require appointments for women because they want to ensure the female barber can handle their hair, due to differences in hair texture and religious reasons (not touching women's hair unless it's family). The customer identified as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's cut. The employees were uncomfortable cutting her hair because of both religious rules and lack of training for women's hair.\n\nThe key points here are the policies in place, which are publicly stated. The customer didn't have an appointment, which the shop uses to manage their female barber's availability. The shop isn't refusing service based on gender per se, but rather based on the customer's appointment status and the need to follow their religious guidelines. However, the customer identified as a woman, so under their policy, an appointment is necessary. The staff's discomfort is also a factor here, especially regarding the religious restrictions. \n\nNow, considering the customer's perspective, they might feel discriminated against because they are a trans man or non-binary person who presents as male but is still being treated as a woman. The shop's policy might not account for gender identity, which could lead to issues of transphobia. However, the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender presentation and hair type, which they might not realize is part of the customer's identity. The shop's policy doesn't explicitly mention gender identity, so they might be inadvertently excluding someone based on how they present.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop's stance is that they follow their religious beliefs and have clear policies in place. They state that they serve everyone but need appointments for women to ensure proper service. The employees are not trained for women's hair, so they can't provide the necessary service without the appointed barber. The customer didn't give notice, so the shop couldn't accommodate them. The customer's reaction might be seen as a misunderstanding of the shop's policy, but the shop's policy might not be inclusive of gender identities beyond the binary.\n\nSo, the question is whether the shop's policy, based on gender as presented and religious beliefs, is discriminatory. If the customer is transgender and their gender identity doesn't align with their assigned sex at birth, the shop's policy could be seen as transphobic if they are being denied service based on gender presentation without considering identity. However, if the shop is following their stated policies and the customer didn't meet the appointment requirement, they might be within their rights. But the problem arises if the policy isn't inclusive of gender identities beyond male and female. Since the shop's policy is based on gender as presented and not identity, it could lead to discrimination against trans or non-binary customers. Therefore, the shop might be in the wrong for not considering gender identity and for having a policy that could be seen as discriminatory.\n"
