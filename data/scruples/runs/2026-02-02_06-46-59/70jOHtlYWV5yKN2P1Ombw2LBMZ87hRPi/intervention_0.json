We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The question is whether the author, who is a barber and manager of a Muslim-owned barbershop, is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop has a policy that women need appointments because they require the female barber, and there's a religious reason behind not cutting women's hair except in family situations.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts presented. The shop's policy is clear on their signs, website, etc., that they serve mostly men and require appointments for women. The customer didn't have an appointment, so according to the policy, they couldn't serve them. The author explains that the reason for this policy is both religious (not touching women's hair except for family) and practical (different tools, training, etc.). The employees were uncomfortable, so they couldn't serve the customer. The customer felt it was transphobic and sexist, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the author's position is that they followed their policy and protected their employees' comfort. The customer's complaint is about discrimination based on gender and possibly gender identity. The key points here are the explicit policy, the religious justification, and the practical considerations.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, in many places, businesses can have certain policies based on religious beliefs, but they can't discriminate based on protected classes like gender identity or expression. The customer is a male-passing woman, which might fall under gender identity or expression. However, the shop's policy is written as \"require appointments for women,\" so if the customer is presenting as a man but identifies as a woman, there's ambiguity. But if the policy is based on gender presentation (male vs. female), then the customer might be considered male, but that could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author argues that the policy is there because of religious reasons and practical training. However, if the policy is causing discrimination against transgender or non-binary individuals, that could be an issue. The author mentions that the female barber is contracted for appointments, which is available for women. The problem here is that the customer didn't have an appointment and the shop didn't have the capacity to serve them that day without the female barber.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the policy is seen as excluding transgender individuals who are transitioning or identifying as male but present as such. However, if the shop is clear about their policy in advance (on their website, signs, etc.), then they might not be at fault because the customer wasn't informed beforehand. But if the customer is part of a protected class and the policy is applied without reasonable accommodation, then it could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is whether the shop has alternatives. The author could have said they can't serve the customer that day but offered to book an appointment for the future. However, the customer was in person and the author didn't do that, leading to the conflict. That might be a point against the author.\n\nIn terms of religious justification, some places have laws that allow for religious exemptions, but others don't, especially when it comes to public accommodations. So the author's stance is based on their religious beliefs, but if those beliefs conflict with anti-discrimination laws, the author could be at fault.\n\nThe employees' comfort is mentioned, which is a valid concern. However, if the shop is a public space, they might be required to serve all customers regardless of employees' personal discomfort, especially if they have a contracted female barber available.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if their policy, regardless of religious justification, leads to discrimination against a protected class, especially if the policy isn't applied consistently or if they could have made an exception. However, if the policy is clearly communicated and the customer is informed in advance, the author might not be at fault. The key is whether the policy is discriminatory and if adequate alternatives (like appointments) are provided.\n"
