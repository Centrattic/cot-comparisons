We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The author is a barber and manager at a primarily Muslim barbershop that serves mostly men. They have a policy requiring women to make appointments because they have a contracted female stylist. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The author refused, citing religious reasons and employee comfort, leading to the customer accusing them of transphobia and sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies in place. The shop clearly states they serve mostly men and have specific arrangements for women, which the author mentions are advertised. The customer didn't follow the appointment system, which is meant to ensure appropriate service. The author's stance is that their employees aren't trained in women's hair due to religious beliefs, and they can't touch women's hair except for family. \n\nThe key points here are the shop's policies and the religious justification. Are they allowed to enforce these policies without discrimination? The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on sex, but there's an exception for religious organizations. Since the shop is primarily Muslim, their religious practices might allow them to have such policies. However, the customer identifies as a male-passing woman, so they might be considered a man in appearance. But legally, gender identity and gender expression can complicate this. \n\nThe shop's policy is about the biological sex of the client and the barber, not gender identity. If the customer is a trans man or non-binary, the policy might not account for that. However, the shop's policy is based on the assumption that women require the female stylist due to religious rules. If the customer is presenting as male, the shop might not consider them under the women's appointment policy, but the customer might feel excluded. \n\nThe author argues that employees aren't comfortable cutting women's hair due to religious reasons, so they can't serve the customer. But if the customer is presenting as male, maybe the shop could have made an exception. However, the shop's policy is in place for a reason, and the author is trying to protect employees from violating their religious beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer might feel that being denied service based on gender presentation is discrimination. The shop's policy might not be inclusive of non-binary or transgender individuals. The question of whether the author is wrong hinges on whether the policy is discriminatory despite religious exemptions. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on their shop's religious policies, which might be protected under the law. However, the way they enforced the policy without considering the customer's identity could be seen as transphobic. The answer isn't straightforward, but based on the information given, the author might not be in the wrong if the policy is properly disclosed and applied consistently. But if the customer's gender presentation was misunderstood, there's room for criticism. However, the shop's stance on religious practices and employee training is a valid consideration. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) given the religious context and clear policies, but with a need to consider inclusivity in future cases.\n"
