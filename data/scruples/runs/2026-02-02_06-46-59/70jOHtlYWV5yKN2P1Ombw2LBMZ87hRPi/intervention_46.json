We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (manager of a barbershop) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women due to religious reasons and lack of training.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The shop primarily serves men, has a female barber available by appointment, and their policy is clear on their website and social media. The customer didn't book an appointment and was denied service because the staff couldn't cut women's hair per their religious beliefs. The customer felt discriminated against and left angry, calling the shop transphobic, etc.\n\nThe author claims that the policy isn't about customers but about the employees' comfort and training. They mention that they can't touch women's hair unless it's family (religious rule), and that women's hair requires different tools/products. The female staff isn't trained in men's cuts, so they need to arrange appointments when she's available. The customer argued they wanted a men's style, so the gender shouldn't matter.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. Even if the policy is stated, if it's applied in a way that denies service to someone based on their gender identity, it might be illegal. Also, the customer was a male-passing woman, which complicates things because they might identify as male or non-binary. The shop's policy could be seen as excluding transgender or gender non-conforming individuals.\n\nReligious exemptions are tricky. While businesses can have religious beliefs, they can't use them to discriminate in public accommodations. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in some cases that religious freedom doesn't override anti-discrimination laws. For example, in Masterpiece Cakeshop, the court found that the free exercise of religion wasn't violated, but that's a specific case. However, general businesses must comply with public accommodations laws.\n\nThe shop's policy is clear, but when someone who appears male (regardless of their actual gender) comes in, and the staff can't cut their hair because of gender, that might be considered discrimination. The customer wasn't told upfront that they couldn't be served because of their gender; they were told they needed an appointment. But the underlying reason was the employees' religious rules about touching women's hair, which the customer didn't disclose upfront. However, the customer's appearance led to the staff making assumptions, which might be problematic.\n\nThe author mentions that the female barber isn't trained in men's cuts, so they can't provide the service even if they wanted to. But if the customer asked for a men's style, maybe the shop could have made accommodations, like suggesting a different date when the female barber isn't scheduled, or finding another solution. However, they state that they can't train in women's hair because of religion, but that doesn't address the customer's specific request for a men's cut.\n\nFrom a discrimination perspective, denying service based on perceived gender or failure to comply with appointment policies that are gender-based might be illegal. The customer could argue that they were denied service because of their gender identity, even if they pass as male. The shop's policy might not account for individuals who don't fit traditional gender norms.\n\nIn terms of empathy, the author feels bad but is protecting employees. However, the law and societal norms are moving towards protecting customers from discrimination, especially in public spaces. The shop's policy might not hold up under legal scrutiny if challenged. The author might be in the wrong because they denied service based on gender-related policies, which could be seen as discriminatory regardless of their religious reasons.\n\nBut I should also consider the religious aspect. Some argue that businesses can hold religious beliefs, but when it comes to public service, there's a limit. The author's stance is that they can't violate their employees' religious beliefs, but the employees' beliefs shouldn't override a customer's right to service unless there's a legal exception. However, in many jurisdictions, there's no such exception that allows discrimination based on religion in public accommodations.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions, while based on religious convictions, likely violate anti-discrimination laws by denying service to someone based on gender identity or perceived gender. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
