We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a barber shop manager, primarily serving men, and they have a policy that requires appointments for women to ensure their female barber can handle those requests. The incident in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut, but the staff weren't comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons. The customer felt discriminated against, calling them transphobic and sexist, and the manager is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity or expression is prohibited. Even if the business has a policy based on religion, there might be conflicts with anti-discrimination laws. The business claiming they can't serve women (or gender non-conforming individuals) because of religious beliefs could be legally problematic. For example, in the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act allows religious exemptions, but only if it's a sincere religious practice and the business isn't a public accommodation. However, since this is a public business, laws like the Civil Rights Act might apply, which prohibit discrimination in public places regardless of religion.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The business is using their religious beliefs to deny service based on the customer's gender identity. Even if the staff isn't comfortable, the business has a responsibility to provide service without discrimination. The fact that the customer is male-passing complicates it, as they might not fit traditional gender norms, but the business's policy seems to apply regardless of that. The manager's defense is about employee comfort and training, but that's not a valid reason to refuse service under anti-discrimination laws.\n\nAlso, the business has a contract with a female barber for appointments. The manager could have offered to schedule an appointment for the next day, but the customer refused. That part is tricky. If the customer was willing to wait, the manager could have accommodated, but since they weren't, the business couldn't serve them. However, the initial refusal without offering alternatives might still be seen as discriminatory. The manager's policy is clear, but the way they communicated it might have exacerbated the situation.\n\nAnother point is the business's signage and website stating their policy. If they explicitly say they serve women with appointments, then refusing a customer who doesn't meet the appointment policy might be justified in terms of policy adherence. However, if the customer doesn't fit neatly into male or female categories, the policy might not cover them, leading to discrimination based on gender identity or expression.\n\nIn terms of religious accommodation vs. anti-discrimination, there's a balance. The business can't claim their religious practices allow them to discriminate in ways that violate civil rights laws. The employees aren't trained for women's haircuts because of religious reasons, but that's a choice the business made. They could argue for religious freedom, but that doesn't override the customer's right to service.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the manager's actions based on religious beliefs and employee comfort likely violate anti-discrimination laws, making them at fault. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
