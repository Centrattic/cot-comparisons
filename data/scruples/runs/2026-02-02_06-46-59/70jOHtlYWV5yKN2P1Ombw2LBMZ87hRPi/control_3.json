We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber and manager in a predominantly Muslim barbershop that mostly serves men. They have a policy requiring women to book appointments because they only have one contracted female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the staff wasn't comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons and the shop's policy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity or expression is prohibited. By denying service to a customer who identifies as a woman (or non-binary) based on their gender and the staff's religious beliefs, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws. Even though the shop has a policy for women, if the customer is perceived as male but identifies as a woman or non-binary, the policy might not account for that, leading to potential discrimination.\n\nNext, the shop's rationale: they state they don't cut women's hair due to religious rules and lack of training. However, if the customer is male-passing and wants a men's cut, the staff's refusal might be based on the customer's gender identity rather than the service requested. This could be seen as transphobic, as they are denying service based on gender identity, not the service itself.\n\nThe shop's policy is in place to manage appointments for women, but in this case, the customer might not be identified as a woman until they state it. The staff's refusal could be seen as not accommodating the customer's needs, even if the policy is generally for women. The argument about texture and tools might not apply here if the customer is having a men's cut, which uses different tools and products, but the staff's religious beliefs are the main issue.\n\nAlso, the shop's stance on serving all customers but having a policy that might exclude some based on gender identity could be problematic. While the shop has the right to hold religious beliefs, businesses generally can't use religious exemptions to discriminate against protected classes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not providing service to a customer based on their gender identity, despite the shop's stated policies and religious reasons.\n"
