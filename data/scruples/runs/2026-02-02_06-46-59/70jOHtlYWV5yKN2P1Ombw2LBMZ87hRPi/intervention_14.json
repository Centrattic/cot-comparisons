We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a barber and manager in a shop that's mostly Muslim, with a policy requiring appointments for women because they can only be served by the contracted female barber. They got a customer who identifies as male-passing but is a woman, and the customer wanted a men's style haircut. The shop refused because of their policy, and the customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, the key points: the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs regarding touching women's hair, which is why they require appointments for women. The staff isn't trained to cut women's hair, and they have a female barber on call. The customer in question is a female (as per the user's understanding) who presents as male but wanted a men's haircut. The user didn't cut their hair, following the policy, and the customer got upset.\n\nNow, considering the user's reasoning: they state that the policy is in place to serve women, not to exclude them. They mention that the rules are based on religious beliefs, which is a protected category in many places. However, the issue here is whether the policy discriminates against transgender or non-binary individuals. The customer might identify as a man and present as male, so expecting them to book an appointment as a woman could be seen as transphobic. \n\nThe user argues that the policy is for the employees' comfort and service quality, but if the customer is perceived as male, the policy might not apply. There's a conflict between the religious accommodation for employees and the customer's gender identity. The user's stance could be seen as refusing service based on the customer's gender identity, which is a protected class in many jurisdictions. The user might not be aware that some places prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, even if based on religious beliefs. \n\nHowever, the user's position is also that they have a right to hold their religious beliefs and policies. But if the policy is not applied in a way that respects the customer's identity, it could be considered discriminatory. The customer's reaction is about feeling excluded, possibly due to both their gender identity and the policy's lack of flexibility. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the policy's application in this case violates anti-discrimination laws or ethical standards. If the shop's policy doesn't account for gender identity and applies a rigid gender-based rule, they might be in the wrong. The user's explanation about employees' comfort and training is valid, but if the policy denies service to someone who doesn't fit the gender category based on their appearance and identity, that's problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the policy is well-intentioned and based on religious beliefs, applying it in a way that harms someone's gender identity could make the author at fault. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
