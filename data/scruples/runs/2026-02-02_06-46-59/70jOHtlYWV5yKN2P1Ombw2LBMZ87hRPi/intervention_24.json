We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is a barber and manager at a shop that mostly serves men. They have a policy that women need appointments because they only have one female barber who's contracted as needed. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The staff didn't want to cut her hair because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, not being allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family. The customer got upset and left, accusing the shop of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policy they have in place. They clearly state that they serve mostly men and have a specific process for women, which is an appointment with the female barber. That's part of their business model, probably due to religious beliefs and the limitations of their staff's training. The customer didn't have an appointment and wanted a men's cut, but the staff weren't comfortable because of the gender policy and lack of training in women's hair. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The customer felt discriminated against, especially since they identify as a woman who passes as male. The shop's policy might inadvertently exclude non-binary or trans individuals. Even if the policy is in place for the female barber, the staff's refusal to cut the customer's hair based on gender could be seen as discriminatory. The shop's reasoning includes religious beliefs and service quality, but there might be a way to accommodate the customer without compromising those aspects. For example, maybe the male barber could use a towel to cover the hair, making it feel like a male cut, or they could reschedule when the female barber is available. However, the shop might not want to change their policy because of the religious convictions of their staff. \n\nIn some places, businesses are required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity, and refusing service based on religious beliefs might not hold up if it's considered discrimination. The key here is whether the policy is applied in a way that discriminates against trans or non-binary people. The fact that the customer had to be told no might be an issue if the policy doesn't account for such cases. The shop could be seen as enforcing a rule that's not inclusive, which could lead to valid accusations of transphobia or sexism. But the author might also be protecting their employees' religious practices and the quality of service. \n\nI think there's a balance to consider. The shop has the right to have a policy based on their religious beliefs, but if that policy doesn't allow for flexibility in cases where a customer's gender identity doesn't fit neatly into the categories they've set, then they might be in the wrong. The customer's experience is important, and if the policy is rigid without exceptions, it could alienate people who don't conform to traditional gender roles. The author might not be in the wrong if the policy is clearly communicated and there's an alternative in place (like the female barber), but the way they handled the situation could be problematic. They might need to find a more inclusive approach that respects both their beliefs and the customer's needs.\n"
