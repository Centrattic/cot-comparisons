We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a barber who's a manager at a shop that's mostly male clientele. The shop has a policy of requiring appointments for women because they have a female barber on contract. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who didn't have an appointment and was refused a haircut. The shop's reason is based on religious beliefs, as the staff isn't trained in women's hair and there's a policy about not touching women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. The customer is transgender, presenting as male but identifying as non-binary or female. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if it denies service based on gender identity. Even if the policy is stated upfront, if it excludes certain people, it could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The shop is using religious beliefs to justify the policy. However, in many countries, religious exemptions don't cover discrimination against protected classes. The shop's requirement for appointments for women might be a way to avoid providing services to transgender people, which could be considered transphobic.\n\nAlso, the customer was told they were transphobic and sexist. The shop's argument is about employee comfort and training, but if they can't accommodate due to religious reasons, they might still be obligated to provide services without violating the employees' beliefs. Maybe the shop could have arranged for the female barber to be there even without an appointment if possible. But the customer might not have wanted to wait.\n\nHowever, the customer didn't make an appointment and the policy was clear. The shop might argue they followed their policy. But if the policy inherently excludes trans or non-binary individuals, that's an issue. The key is whether the shop's policy is discriminatory under the law. If the shop is allowed to have such a policy, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if it's illegal, then they are.\n\nIn the US, for example, there are cases where businesses have been required to serve LGBTQ+ individuals despite religious objections. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recognizes discrimination against transgender individuals as sex discrimination. So if the policy effectively prevents transgender people from receiving services, it's a legal issue.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because the policy could be seen as discriminatory, even if it's stated upfront. The shop's refusal to provide service based on gender identity without an exception could violate anti-discrimination laws. The fact that the customer was male-passing but identified differently would fall under gender identity protections. The employees' discomfort due to religious beliefs doesn't override the customer's right to service unless there's a specific religious exemption, which is rare in anti-discrimination contexts.\n\nSo, considering legal and ethical standards, the author is likely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes).\n"
