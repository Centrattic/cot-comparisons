We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a manager at a barbershop that mainly serves men. They have a policy that women need appointments because there's a contracted female barber. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The barbers didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair because of religious reasons (they can't touch women's hair unless it's family), and since the female barber wasn't there, they couldn't help her. The customer got upset and called them transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the policies. The shop states on their website and social media that they require appointments for women. That's clear. The customer might not have known or read that, but if they did, they might expect appointments. However, the customer identifies as male-passing, so maybe they expected to be treated like a regular male customer. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, which is a protected right, but does that affect the customer's right to service?\n\nThe shop's policy is that they don't train in women's hair because of their religion. But if the customer is presenting as male and wants a men's cut, maybe they feel the shop should accommodate them regardless. The problem is that the shop's employees are uncomfortable due to religious rules. The author had to tell them to wait for the female barber, but that required an appointment. The customer didn't want to wait or didn't know about the appointment system. \n\nNow, considering the customer's perspective: they might feel discriminated against because they can't get a service just because of their gender identity. The shop's policy might be seen as excluding transgender or male-passing individuals. However, the shop's policy is based on their religious practices, which could be a defense under religious exemptions. But in many places, service providers can't refuse based on gender identity, even if it's for religious reasons. \n\nThe shop's employees are not trained in women's hair, but if the customer is male-passing, maybe they can be treated as a male customer. The shop's refusal could be seen as not providing equal service. Also, the customer was called a bully, which might be unfair if the shop is following its stated policies. However, the customer might not know the policy, leading to frustration. \n\nSo, the key points are: the shop's policy is clear, but does it conflict with anti-discrimination laws? If the shop is providing equal service to cisgender men and women (through appointments), but the customer here is in a gray area (male-passing woman), there's a conflict between religious practices and the customer's rights. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, businesses can't deny service based on gender identity. So even if the shop has a religious reason, they might be violating anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they refused service to a customer who identifies in a way that the shop's policies don't explicitly cover. However, if the shop's policy is clearly communicated and the customer didn't follow it, maybe the shop isn't at fault. But since the customer is male-passing, they might not have been aware they needed an appointment. \n\nAnother angle: the shop could adjust their policy to be more inclusive, but they have religious reasons. However, legal obligations might override that. So, the answer might depend on local laws. But since the question is about morality, not legality, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're following their religious policy. But from a customer's rights perspective, they are in the wrong. \n\nI'm a bit confused because the answer depends on whether the shop's policy is legally permissible. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong morally. If the shop's policy is clear and the customer didn't follow it, maybe not. But if the policy is discriminatory, then yes. Since the shop only serves women via appointments and the customer didn't have one, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, if the customer is male-passing and should be treated as male, then the shop's policy is discriminatory. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the main issue is whether the shop's policy is inclusive enough. They have a female barber for women, but if someone is male-passing and wants a men's cut, they should be treated like a regular male customer. The shop's refusal to cut her hair because of gender, even if they have religious reasons, might be seen as transphobic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
