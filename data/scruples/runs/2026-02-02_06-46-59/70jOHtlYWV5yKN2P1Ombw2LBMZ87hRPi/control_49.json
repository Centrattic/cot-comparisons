We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the barber (author) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women because they have a female barber on contract. The shop's policy is stated on their website and social media, and the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's stated policies. They clearly mention that they have a specific process for women's appointments. The customer might have known this, but if they identified as a man or male-passing, maybe they expected to be treated as a regular male customer. The shop's reasoning is that they can't cut women's hair unless it's family, which is a religious policy. They also mention that the female barber isn't available that day without an appointment, which the customer didn't have.\n\nThe customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist. Now, the key here is whether the shop's policy discriminates against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. If the customer identifies as male, even if they are biologically female, the shop's policy based on biological sex might conflict with the customer's gender identity. However, the shop's policy is based on their religious beliefs and they have a contract for female barbers. \n\nBut in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. For example, in the US, the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on sex, which includes gender identity. So if the shop's policy is based on the customer's biological sex rather than their gender identity, it could be problematic if the customer identifies as male. They might see the policy as excluding them based on their gender identity, which is illegal. However, if the shop is a religious institution or has a religious exemption, that might affect things. But the user mentions they are primarily Muslim, but it's not clear if the business itself is a religious institution. \n\nAnother angle: the shop's stated policy is that women need appointments. If the customer is male-passing, they might not be aware of this policy when coming in, especially if the signage isn't clear. The staff's discomfort comes from religious reasons, but refusing service based on gender identity could be seen as discrimination. The shop is prioritizing their employees' comfort and religious beliefs over the customer's experience, which could be legally and ethically questionable.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, depending on the country, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the US, Title VII allows religious exemptions, but transgender individuals are protected under Title VII as well. If the shop is not a religious institution, they might not have the same exemptions. The shop's policy could be seen as discriminatory if it's based on gender identity rather than biological sex.\n\nEthically, the shop is causing harm to the customer by denying service based on their gender identity. Even if their policy is based on religious beliefs, allowing such a policy might perpetuate discrimination against trans individuals. The customer's reaction of feeling targeted and the accusations of being transphobic might be valid if the shop's policy doesn't account for gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop has their reasons based on religion and policy, the way they handled the situation might be discriminatory against transgender individuals. The author, as the manager, failed to consider the customer's gender identity and the legal implications, which could mean they are in the wrong.\n"
