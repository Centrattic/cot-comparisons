We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and the salon's policy requires appointments for women. The salon states on their website and signs that they have a female barber for women's appointments. The employees are Muslim, and there's a religious rule against male employees touching women's hair unless it's family. The customer wanted a man's style cut but was denied because the salon couldn't accommodate women's appointments without the female barber.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies the salon has in place. They clearly have a policy stating that women need appointments, and they have a female barber for that. The customer, who identifies as male-passing but is a woman, was told they need an appointment. The manager argues that the policy is in place for employee comfort and service quality due to religious beliefs and hair texture differences.\n\nHowever, the customer felt discriminated against and called the salon transphobic and sexist. The key here is understanding the intersection of religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't deny services based on gender identity or expression. Even if the salon's policy is to only serve women through appointments, if the customer is transgender and presents as male, they might be considered outside the salon's stated policy. \n\nAlso, the salon's policy might be seen as excluding transgender individuals who don't fit traditional gender roles. The fact that the customer wanted a men's cut but was turned away because they're biologically female (but present as male) could be problematic. The salon might be enforcing a policy that doesn't account for gender identity, which could be discriminatory. \n\nMoreover, the salon's religious beliefs are a factor, but in many jurisdictions, anti-discrimination laws take precedence over religious exemptions, especially in public accommodations. The salon's policy could be seen as refusing service to someone based on gender identity, which is illegal in certain areas. \n\nThe employees' discomfort is mentioned, but that doesn't necessarily justify discrimination. The salon could have trained employees to handle such cases respectfully or adjusted policies to include transgender customers. The manager's solution was to require an appointment, but the customer didn't have time. The salon's stance might be rigid, not considering the individual's needs and identity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the salon has policies based on their religious beliefs, those policies might be violating anti-discrimination laws by denying service to a transgender individual. The author's actions could be considered discriminatory, hence in the wrong.\n"
