We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a barber turned away a customer who was a male-passing woman, not cutting their hair because their shop has a policy requiring appointments for women, and the staff isn't trained or comfortable with women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist, and the author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The shop explicitly states on their website and social media that they have a female barber available by appointment. The policy is in place because they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, which they mention are part of their Muslim faith. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women's hair, and the staff aren't trained for that. The author argues that they needed to call in the female barber, which would require a couple of hours notice, but the customer didn't want to wait and left upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down from different angles.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender, sex, or gender identity. However, there's an exception for religious reasons. The shop is a religious business, and they're following their religious beliefs. But does that hold up if the customer is trans? The customer identifies as a woman but is presenting as male. This complicates things because the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as a woman, but the customer might not identify as such. Wait, actually, the customer is a male-passing woman, meaning they were assigned male at birth but identify as a woman. So the shop's policy is denying service based on the customer's gender identity, not their sex. But the shop's policy is based on the customer being a woman (biologically?) or their gender identity? The problem here is that if the policy is based solely on biological sex, then a trans woman might not be considered a woman under that policy. However, if the policy is based on gender identity, then they are denying service to a trans woman, which could be discriminatory.\n\nBut the shop says their policy is in place because they require appointments for women, and they don't train staff on women's hair due to religious beliefs. The staff aren't comfortable cutting women's hair unless it's family. However, if the customer is a trans woman, they might identify as a woman and present as such, so the shop's policy might be seen as excluding them, which could be transphobic. On the other hand, the shop is following their religious beliefs, which might be protected under religious freedom laws. The tension here is between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws.\n\nIn the US, for example, there have been cases where businesses claimed religious exemptions to deny services to LGBTQ+ individuals. Courts have sometimes ruled in favor of the businesses, but other times against them. The key is whether the shop is actually violating anti-discrimination laws. If the shop's policy is to only serve women via appointment, but the customer identifies as a woman (even if they are trans), then the shop might be refusing service to a woman, which could be illegal. However, if the shop's policy is based on biological sex, then a trans woman might be excluded. But the customer in this case is male-passing but presenting as a woman, so it's not entirely clear. Also, the customer wanted a men's style haircut, which might suggest they are presenting as male, but they are a woman. This adds another layer of confusion.\n\nThe shop's policy is also stated publicly, so the customer might have been expecting to make an appointment. However, the customer didn't have an appointment and the shop refused service. The author argues that they needed a couple of hours to call in the female barber, but the customer didn't want to wait. The author feels bad but is concerned about employee comfort and the quality of service.\n\nFrom a standpoint of religious accommodation, the shop is allowed to have policies based on their beliefs, but when does that cross into discrimination? If the shop is a public accommodation, they might be required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity, unless an exception is made for religious reasons. The answer would depend on the specific laws in their jurisdiction. In some places, religious exemptions might not override anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nAdditionally, the shop is a business, and while they can have certain policies, they can't exclude protected classes. If gender identity is a protected class in their area, then the shop's policy could be discriminatory. If not, then the shop might be within their rights. However, the way the policy is applied could still be problematic. For example, if a cisgender woman comes in without an appointment and they serve her, but a trans woman is denied, that's discriminatory. But in this case, the shop has a general policy for all women, which might be applied regardless of gender identity. However, the customer's gender identity complicates that. The shop might be inadvertently excluding trans women who need women's services but present in a way that's not immediately obvious.\n\nThe author might also be conflating the customer's gender identity with their biological sex. If the customer identifies as a woman and is presenting as such, the shop's policy based on biological sex could be discriminatory. The shop's policy should consider gender identity, not just biological sex. However, the shop's policy is rooted in religious beliefs about touch between genders. If they believe they can't touch a woman's hair unless it's family, then a trans woman would still be a woman in their eyes, and the policy would apply. But if the shop's policy is based on the customer's biological sex, then the trans woman might be excluded.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they might be in the wrong if their policy denies service to a protected class (gender identity) without a valid exemption. However, if the policy is based on religious beliefs and there's a religious exemption, then they might not be in the wrong. The answer might depend on the specific laws in their area. But given the common trend in many places to protect against discrimination based on gender identity, the author might be in the wrong if their policy is denying service to a trans woman. However, the shop is being transparent about their policy, so the customer should have known to make an appointment. But the customer might not have identified as a woman in the way the shop expects, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nIn conclusion, considering that the shop has a policy that affects trans individuals and that in many jurisdictions, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited, the author might be in the wrong. They could be seen as applying a policy that excludes trans women, even if it's not intentional. However, if the policy is based on religious exemptions and there's no law covering gender identity in their area, they might not be in the wrong. But given the general trend towards protecting gender identity, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
