We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a barber who refused to cut a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman, and their salon only serves women by appointment due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The salon has a policy that women need appointments because male barbers can't touch women's hair outside of family, based on their faith. They have a female barber who works on an appointment basis. The customer wanted a men's style cut but since they identify as a male-passing woman, the staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair. The customer accused the salon of being transphobic, etc.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Key points here: the salon's policy is clear, stated on their website and signage. However, the customer doesn't fit neatly into their categories. They're a male-passing woman, so the salon's policy for women (appointments) might not apply directly. The salon's policy is based on religious beliefs, but that doesn't necessarily override anti-discrimination laws in many places. \n\nAlso, the salon's policy allows women to be served through appointments, but when the customer doesn't need a woman's haircut, the policy might be causing a conflict. The customer might feel that their gender identity should be recognized, and the salon is gatekeeping based on perceived gender rather than actual need. The staff's discomfort is due to both religious reasons and lack of training, but if the customer is male-passing, maybe they should be treated as a male customer. \n\nOn the other hand, the salon has the right to set their policies based on their beliefs, but if their policy excludes transgender or non-binary individuals, that could be problematic. The salon's stance might be seen as discriminatory if they can't accommodate the customer without violating their religious beliefs. They could argue that their policy is clear and they can't make exceptions, but there's a nuance here with gender identity. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the salon's policy, while based on their religious beliefs, leads to discrimination against transgender individuals. However, if the policy is in place to comply with their religious practices and they have a system in place (appointments for women) that they can't bend without causing conflict among staff, they might not be in the wrong. But the customer's perspective is that they were denied service based on their gender identity, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nI need to check if there's a legal aspect. In many regions, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression, even if it's for religious reasons. The salon's policy might be conflicting with anti-discrimination laws. The author's reasoning is about employee comfort and religious training, but if the customer is male-passing, it's unclear if that's a valid reason under the law.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the customer was transphobic, etc. The customer might not have been transphobic, but the salon's refusal could be seen as such. The key is whether the salon is enforcing their policy in a way that's inclusive of all gender identities. If they have a female barber on contract, even if she's not present, maybe they could have made an exception or communicated the policy better.\n\nIn conclusion, while the salon's policy is based on their religious beliefs, applying it in a way that excludes transgender individuals might be problematic. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't find a solution (like calling the female barber even with short notice) and instead refused service, leading to accusations of discrimination. However, if the policy is clear and they can't make exceptions without violating their beliefs or causing staff discomfort, they might not be in the wrong. But given the current societal standards, the answer might lean towards AITA being the author.\n"
