We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a barber who refused to cut a male-passing woman's hair because the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women and only one female barber available. The customer felt discriminated against and called the shop transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of the shop. They clearly state on their website and social media that they require appointments for women, so the customer should have known this beforehand. The shop's policy is based on religious reasons, specifically that male employees can't cut women's hair except for family members. The female barber is available but only by appointment. The customer came in without an appointment and was told they couldn't be served, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, the shop manager argues that they have a system in place to serve all customers, but the customer felt it was unfair. The key points here are whether the policy is discriminatory. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, which might be protected, but the way it's implemented could be problematic. The customer in question is a male-passing woman, which adds a layer of gender identity and expression. \n\nThe shop's employees are not trained in women's hair cutting because of their religion. This raises questions about accessibility and whether they are fulfilling their service obligations. Even though the shop allows women to be served via appointments, the policy might indirectly discriminate against transgender or non-binary individuals who identify as women but may not present as such. However, in this case, the customer identified as a woman but presented as male, so maybe there's confusion about gender identity here.\n\nThe main issue is whether the shop's policy is discriminatory. While they have a stated policy and it's publicly advertised, denying service to someone who fits the male-passing woman description could be seen as a refusal based on gender identity, especially if the customer is transgender. The shop's policy might not account for such cases, leading to the customer feeling excluded.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop is also protecting their employees' religious freedoms. They have a right to operate under their beliefs, but there's a balance between that and providing equal service. If the shop's policy is written to serve women via appointments, then it should be consistent. However, if the customer didn't book an appointment, the shop isn't at fault for enforcing their own rules. But if the customer's gender expression made it difficult for them to be served, even though they are a woman, that's a problem.\n\nI think the shop has a right to have their policies based on religious beliefs, but they might not be accommodating enough for all customers, especially those with different gender expressions. The customer was told the policy upfront, but if they're transgender, the policy could be seen as transphobic. The shop might need to adjust their policy to be more inclusive while respecting their religious practices. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not finding a solution that respects both the customer's needs and the employees' beliefs.\n"
