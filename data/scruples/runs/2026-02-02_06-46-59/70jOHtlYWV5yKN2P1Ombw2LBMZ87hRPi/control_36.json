We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but the shop only serves women by appointment with their female stylist, due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, the key points: The shop states on their website and signage that they contract a female stylist for women. The customer is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but the staff isn't trained in women's hair due to religious beliefs. The manager explains it's not about the customer's identity but their policies to ensure proper service and religious compliance. The customer accused them of transphobia, sexism, etc., and left upset.\n\nNow, considering the religious aspect: Islam has guidelines about modesty and interaction between genders, so the shop's policy might be based on that. However, the customer's gender identity is male-passing, which complicates things. If the customer identifies as male, but the shop's policy is based on biological sex, there's a conflict. But the shop's policy is clear about serving women through appointments, which the customer didn't follow. \n\nThe manager argues that the policy isn't about the customer's identity but about the staff's training and religious rules. They mention that they can't train for women's cuts due to religion, so they rely on a contracted female stylist. The customer might not have known about the appointment requirement if they identified as male, but the shop's policies are publicly stated. \n\nIs the manager wrong? If the policy is publicly stated and the customer didn't follow it, the manager isn't necessarily at fault. However, if the policy is discriminatory or doesn't accommodate transgender individuals, they might be. The customer could argue that being male-passing should allow them to be served under the men's policy. But the shop's policy is based on the customer's sex as presented, which the customer might be challenging. \n\nAlso, the manager mentions that the staff isn't comfortable cutting their hair due to religious reasons. The customer might perceive this as discrimination. But the manager is following the shop's established policy, which is communicated upfront. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, in some places, businesses can have policies based on gender, but when it comes to transgender individuals, the rules can be more nuanced. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as presented, and the customer is male-passing, the shop might be within their rights. However, if the policy is used to exclude transgender individuals, it could be problematic. \n\nThe manager's intention was to protect employees' beliefs and provide proper service. The customer felt discriminated against. The key is whether the shop's policy is discriminatory. Since the policy is in place for all women and the staff isn't trained, and the shop provides a way to serve women via appointments, maybe the manager is not in the wrong. But if the shop could make an exception here without violating religious practices, that's a different angle. However, the manager explains they need to call the female stylist, which requires notice. The customer didn't book an appointment, so the manager might not be obligated to accommodate last-minute requests. \n\nIn conclusion, the manager followed the shop's stated policy, which is communicated publicly. The customer might not have considered the appointment system, especially if they identify as male. The manager's actions were based on policy and religious beliefs, not personal dislike. Therefore, the manager might not be in the wrong.\n"
