We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer identified as a male-passing woman, and the salon's policy requires appointments for women. The salon has a religious policy where male barbers can't cut women's hair, and they only have a female barber available by appointment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can have policies based on gender, especially if it's rooted in religious beliefs. The US has the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which might protect such policies. But there's also anti-discrimination laws. However, since the salon is private and not a public accommodation in the sense of government services, maybe it's protected. Wait, but in the US, Title VII applies to employers, not necessarily customers. So maybe the salon can have such policies.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the customer's identity. The customer is a male-passing woman. If the salon's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their own perception, but the salon's policy is based on the customer's biological sex, there might be a conflict. But the customer's gender identity versus the salon's religious beliefs. This is tricky. Some states have laws that protect both religious practices and anti-discrimination, but how they balance is complex.\n\nThe salon states upfront that they require appointments for women, which the customer knew. The customer argued they wanted a men's cut, but the policy isn't about the type of cut but the customer's gender. The salon's reasoning is about religious restrictions against male barbers cutting women's hair. They also mention that their training is for men's hair only, which might be a valid operational policy.\n\nHowever, the customer felt discriminated against, calling them transphobic. The salon's argument is that they have a policy in place and can't make exceptions. But maybe the customer is non-binary and the salon's policy doesn't account for that. The key point here is whether the salon's policy is inclusive of all gender identities or only binary. If the policy is based on the customer's self-identification, they might have a problem. But if it's based on biological sex, maybe not.\n\nAlso, the salon mentions they can call in the female barber if given a few hours' notice. But the customer didn't want to wait. The salon's policy is about appointments for women, so maybe the customer didn't book one. But the customer might not have known or expected to book an appointment. The salon's policy is clear on their website, so maybe the customer didn't follow the process.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, the Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop allowed businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs in some cases. But that was specific to a baker refusing to make a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding. It's not the same scenario. However, there's a growing trend towards anti-discrimination laws that protect gender identity. So if the customer is transgender or non-binary, the salon's policy might conflict with those protections.\n\nAnother angle is the salon's own policy: they state they serve everyone, but have specific appointment rules. If the customer is male-passing but identifies as a woman, the salon's policy might not be accommodating. The salon's reasoning about different hair textures and tools could be a legitimate business reason, but if it's a cover for discrimination, that's different. However, the salon does have a female barber available, so it's more about the male barbers not being trained or permitted to cut women's hair.\n\nThe customer felt the salon was transphobic, which adds a layer. If the customer is transgender, the salon's policy could be seen as discriminatory based on gender identity. But if the policy is based on biological sex, then perhaps not. However, many legal protections now cover gender identity, making this a gray area.\n\nIn conclusion, the salon's actions might be within their legal rights based on religious practices and clear policies. However, from a social justice perspective, they might be seen as discriminatory if the policy doesn't consider gender identity. The answer depends on the jurisdiction and the interpretation of laws. If the author followed their stated policy and provided a way to get service (through the female barber with notice), maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the policy excludes trans or non-binary individuals, they might be. Given the information, the answer isn't straightforward, but legally, they might be in the right. However, the social perception might still see them as wrong.\n"
