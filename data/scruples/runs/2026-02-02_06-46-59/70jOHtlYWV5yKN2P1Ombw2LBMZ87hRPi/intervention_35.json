We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the barbershop manager is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because they're a male-passing woman. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the barbershop mainly serves men, and they have a policy that women need appointments because they want to ensure the female stylist is available. The shop is primarily Muslim, and their religious beliefs mean that male employees can't cut women's hair unless it's family. The female stylist is contracted for women. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The manager explained that they need appointments for women because of their policy, but the customer felt discriminated against, leading to accusations of transphobia, etc.\n\nSo, the key points here are the shop's policies based on religion and the customer's identity. The shop is clear about their appointment system for women, which is part of their stated policy. They mention this on their website, Facebook, etc. The customer might not have known the policy beforehand, but the shop is upfront about it. However, the customer identified as a male-passing woman, which complicates things. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can have policies based on religious beliefs, but they also need to comply with anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act allows religious accommodations, but also prohibits discrimination based on sex, which could include gender identity. There's a tension here between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. \n\nIf the shop is transparent about their policy, then they might not be in the wrong because they're informing customers beforehand. However, if the policy is applied in a way that discriminates against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals, that's where it gets tricky. The shop's reasoning is that they can't serve women unless it's through an appointment with the female stylist. But the customer is presenting as male, so does that fall under the women's policy? If the customer is perceived as a man, then the shop's policy might not apply, but if the customer identifies as a woman, then the appointment system is required. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the shop's employees' comfort. The staff isn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons, so they can't provide the service even if they wanted to. The manager is prioritizing employee comfort and adherence to their religious practices. But if the customer is a trans man, then the shop's policy might be excluding them unnecessarily. \n\nThe customer left angry, calling the shop transphobic, which is a serious accusation. The manager feels they had to balance between employee comfort and customer service. The question is whether the shop's policy, even if clearly stated, is discriminatory. \n\nIn some states, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, even if it's a religious exemption. So if this happened in a state with such laws, the shop might be in violation. However, the manager is following their religious beliefs and has a stated policy. It's a complex issue where both sides have valid points. \n\nI think the manager's intention wasn't to discriminate but to follow religious guidelines, but in practice, it led to discrimination against a trans or non-binary individual. The answer might depend on local laws and how the policy is applied. However, the manager might be in the wrong because they didn't make an exception or find a solution, like contacting the female stylist even if it took a couple of hours. The customer was denied service not because of a lack of resources but because of a rigid policy. So maybe the manager is in the wrong because the policy, while clear, resulted in discrimination against a customer who didn't fit neatly into the gender categories the shop had set up.\n"
