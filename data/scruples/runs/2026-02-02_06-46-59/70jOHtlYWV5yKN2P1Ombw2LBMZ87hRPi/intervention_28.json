We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the manager of a barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because the male employees can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. The shop has a female barber on contract.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The shop is predominantly Muslim, and their religious beliefs prevent male employees from cutting women's hair except for family. They have a policy to book the female barber for women. The customer, a male-passing woman, was denied a haircut because the female barber wasn't available that day. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nThe manager claims they needed a couple hours' notice to bring in the female barber, but the customer wasn't willing to wait. The manager is defending the policy to protect employees' religious practices and ensure proper service. However, the customer felt discriminated against.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. If the shop is refusing service based on the customer's gender presentation, that might be an issue. The policy is in place for religious reasons, but if it results in denying service to a transgender or gender non-conforming person, it could be seen as discriminatory, even if the intention is religious accommodation.\n\nReligious exemptions vary by location. Some places allow businesses to follow religious practices, but others prioritize anti-discrimination laws. The shop's policy is clear about serving women via appointments, but when a customer doesn't fit neatly into those categories (like a male-passing woman), there's ambiguity. The manager might not have considered how their policy affects transgender or non-binary customers.\n\nThe manager's stance is about respecting employees' beliefs and service quality. However, if the policy effectively excludes certain customers, it could be problematic. The key is whether the policy is applied fairly. If the shop can provide the same service to cisgender women with appointments, but can't for this customer, even though they're asking for a men's cut, there's inconsistency. The customer might argue they were treated differently because of their gender identity.\n\nAlso, the manager mentions they have a female barber available on contract. If the customer was willing to wait a couple hours, the shop could accommodate. The fact that they couldn't due to the customer's refusal to wait might be a factor, but the initial denial could still be seen as discriminatory.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop has its religious reasons, the way the policy was applied might have led to discrimination against a transgender or non-binary customer. The manager might be in the wrong if the policy isn't adaptable to different gender identities, leading to unfair treatment.\n"
