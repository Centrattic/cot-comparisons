We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a barber shop that's mostly Muslim, serves men, and has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have female barbers trained for women's hair due to religious reasons. Now, a customer who is a male-passing woman comes in and wants a haircut. The barbers didn't cut her hair because they had the policy, and she accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The shop's policy is clear: they require appointments for women so they can bring in the contracted female barber. They mention this on their signage and online. The customer might not have known or didn't realize the policy. The author, as the manager, tried to explain but the customer left upset, calling them names. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me think. The customer identified as a male-passing woman, so maybe they were in a situation where they needed a cut but weren't aware the policy applied to them. The shop's policy is about serving women, but this customer might not be seen as a woman by the staff. However, the customer's gender identity is important here. If the shop's policy is based on gender, then turning away someone who is a transgender or non-binary person who presents as male might be an issue. \n\nThe shop's justification is religious, not cutting women's hair. But if the customer is a woman (or identifies as such), the policy applies. However, if the customer is male-passing and didn't book an appointment, maybe the staff didn't recognize them as a woman. The problem arises if the policy is based on perceived gender or biological sex. The shop might be enforcing a rule that doesn't account for gender identity. \n\nIn many places, businesses can have policies based on gender, but when it comes to transgender or non-binary individuals, it gets tricky. If the customer is a trans man, the shop's refusal to cut their hair without an appointment (since they're trained for women's hair) might be discriminatory. However, the shop's argument is that they can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. But if the customer is a man (even trans), then maybe the policy doesn't apply. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the staff's comfort and training. If they aren't trained to cut women's hair, but this customer is presenting as male, maybe they should have been able to proceed. The shop's policy might not have considered situations where someone's gender presentation doesn't align with their perceived gender. \n\nOn the other hand, the shop is transparent about their policies. They state they require appointments for women. If the customer didn't book an appointment, the shop followed their policy. But if the customer's gender identity isn't recognized, they might have been unfairly treated. \n\nThe staff's religious beliefs might protect them from certain obligations, but when a customer is denied service based on gender identity, that could be a problem. Also, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws if they don't serve based on gender identity. \n\nI need to check if in the jurisdiction they're in (assuming the US, since it's an AITA post), discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. Many U.S. states do protect against that. If the shop is refusing service to a trans person because they don't fit into their gender policies, that could be illegal. \n\nSo, the author's decision to not cut the customer's hair might be in the wrong because they refused service based on the customer's gender identity or expression, even if they have a policy in place. The policy might not account for trans or non-binary individuals. Also, the shop could be violating anti-discrimination laws by not providing services regardless of gender identity. \n\nBut the shop also has religious protections. However, in the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act says that religious practices can require certain accommodations, but it's a balance. If the customer isn't a woman in the eyes of the shop, then the policy doesn't apply. However, if the customer is a woman (trans or non-binary), the policy does apply, but the shop might not be equipped to handle that. \n\nThis is a complex situation. On one hand, the shop's policy is clear and based on religious beliefs. On the other hand, they might be discriminating against someone based on gender identity. The customer might have been denied service not because they are a woman but because they don't fit the shop's traditional gender binary. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they failed to accommodate the customer's gender identity. By having a policy that requires appointments for women, they might have inadvertently excluded trans or non-binary customers. The shop should update their policy to be more inclusive, perhaps not based on gender but on the type of service needed. Alternatively, they could make exceptions for walk-ins if feasible. The fact that the customer was left upset and accused of being transphobic suggests that the shop's policy might not consider modern understandings of gender. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
