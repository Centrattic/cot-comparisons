We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who refused to cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and they have a policy requiring appointments for women. The key points here are the shop's religious beliefs and their stated policies.\n\nFirst, the shop's website and marketing materials explicitly mention that they have a female barber available for women by appointment. The customer didn't make an appointment, so the manager followed the policy. But the customer felt discriminated against, calling them transphobic and sexist.\n\nThe main issue here is whether not cutting the hair was a violation of anti-discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the shop has a religious exemption, it's not clear if this applies here. The argument is that they're not refusing service to women, but in this case, the customer is a transgender woman or non-binary person who presents as male. So the shop's policy might not account for that scenario.\n\nAlso, the shop's reason for needing appointments is to ensure that the female barber handles women's hair, but if the customer is male-passing and wants a men's cut, does that override the policy? The manager might have been able to make an exception here, especially since the customer didn't fit neatly into the categories the shop has set up. The employee's discomfort due to religious beliefs could also be a factor, but forcing an employee to cut someone's hair against their beliefs might be different from the shop's responsibility to serve all customers.\n\nAnother angle is the shop's training. If they only train for men's hair due to religious reasons, that's a business choice they've made public. But when a customer doesn't fit into the expected categories, the shop might be obligated to find a solution, even if it means adjusting their usual practices. The manager's refusal could be seen as not making reasonable accommodations, especially if the customer's identity isn't immediately clear.\n\nLooking at the legal side, in places where discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited, the shop's refusal could be considered discriminatory. The manager might be in the wrong for not making an exception or not being prepared for such a situation. Additionally, the shop's policy is clear, but the customer's presentation complicates things. It's possible that the shop didn't anticipate this scenario when creating their policies, leading to a conflict.\n\nUltimately, the manager's decision to follow the policy without exception might have been the wrong move. They should have considered the customer's identity and whether the policy could be flexibly applied. The backlash the customer faced\u2014being called transphobic\u2014might be justified if the shop's actions were indeed discriminatory. So, the answer is yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
