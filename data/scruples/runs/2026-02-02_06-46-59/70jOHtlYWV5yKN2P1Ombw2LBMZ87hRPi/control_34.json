We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the barber is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo the barber is a manager at a shop that mostly serves men, with one female barber on contract. They have a policy that women need appointments, probably because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, men aren't allowed to cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style cut. The barber explained the appointment policy, but the customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the shop's policies based on religious beliefs and the customer's identity. The author mentions that their religion prohibits male barbers from cutting women's hair, hence the female barber being contracted for women. The customer, being a trans man or non-binary person, might not identify as a woman but presents as male. The shop's policy is based on the customer's assigned gender at birth or their current appearance?\n\nWait, the customer is male-passing, so maybe the shop staff saw them as male and thus didn't require an appointment. But the customer wanted a men's cut, so they didn't need the female barber. However, the staff's religious rules might require that women can only be cut by the female barber. If the customer is a trans man, they might identify as male, but the shop's policy is based on biological sex? Or maybe they didn't know the customer's gender identity and just went by appearance. \n\nThe problem arises because the customer felt discriminated against, accused the barbers of being transphobic or sexist. The barbers argue they're following their religious practices and policies. Are they allowed to have such policies? In some places, religious exemptions allow businesses to discriminate based on faith, but in others, anti-discrimination laws might override that, especially regarding gender identity or expression.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, it's complicated. In some jurisdictions, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, so even if the policy is based on religion, it might not be a valid defense. Ethically, if the policy excludes trans or non-binary people regardless of their identity, it could be seen as discriminatory. The shop's policy might not account for gender identity, only biological sex, which could lead to issues with trans customers. \n\nThe author also mentions that they wanted to protect their employees' religious beliefs, which is a valid concern. But if the policy is applied without considering the customer's gender identity, it might be problematic. The customer might feel that being male-passing but being treated as female because of their assigned sex at birth is unfair. The shop's policy could be seen as not accommodating the customer's gender identity, leading to the accusation of transphobia.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong from a religious standpoint, but legally and ethically, there's a case to be made that they discriminated against the customer. The answer might depend on the specific laws in their area. However, the user is asking if the author is wrong in general, not just legally. So considering both perspectives, the answer could be a mix. But since the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide based on the context given. The question is whether the author violated any principles of fairness or anti-discrimination. If the policy is rigid without exceptions for gender identity, then the author might be in the wrong. Otherwise, if they followed their stated policy and can't accommodate due to religious and employee comfort, maybe not. But the customer's experience suggests that the policy is not inclusive enough. So perhaps the answer is A (yes), the author is in the wrong because the policy fails to account for the customer's gender identity and may be discriminatory.\n"
