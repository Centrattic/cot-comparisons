We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the manager of a barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women because they have a female barber available on a contract basis. The shop's primary customers are men, and they have a policy that stems from religious beliefs, not wanting male employees to cut women's hair. However, the customer was trans or non-binary, and they got upset, calling the shop transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited under anti-discrimination laws. Even if the shop's policy is based on religion, there might be a conflict here. Religious exemptions aren't always absolute, especially when they infringe on civil rights. The shop stated they serve all customers, but their policy might not accommodate transgender or non-binary individuals who don't fit the traditional gender categories.\n\nNext, the shop's policy is clear on their website and signage, but did they communicate this to the customer beforehand? The customer might not have known that the policy applies to their identity, especially if they identify as male-passing. The manager mentions that they require appointments for women, but if the customer is perceived as a man, the policy might not apply. However, the shop's religious reasons for not cutting women's hair could complicate this. The manager is also concerned about employee comfort and training, but that might not be a valid reason if the policy leads to discrimination.\n\nThe user is Muslim, and the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs. However, laws in many countries prioritize anti-discrimination over religious exemptions. For example, in the U.S., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act allows religious practices to be accommodated, but it also prohibits discrimination. There's a balance here, but if the policy excludes transgender individuals, it could be seen as discriminatory regardless of the religious basis.\n\nAdditionally, the shop's response to the customer's request was to enforce a policy that inadvertently excluded them. The customer was willing to wait for the female barber, but the shop didn't consider their situation. The manager's defense is about employees' comfort and training, but that doesn't address the customer's right to service. The manager might have been in a difficult position between respecting employees' religious beliefs and providing equal service.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager might be in the wrong because the policy, while based on religious beliefs, results in discrimination against transgender or non-binary customers. Even if the policy is clearly stated, it's possible that it violates anti-discrimination laws. The shop could be seen as not making reasonable accommodations for the customer's gender identity, thereby being transphobic. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the manager is in the wrong).\n"
