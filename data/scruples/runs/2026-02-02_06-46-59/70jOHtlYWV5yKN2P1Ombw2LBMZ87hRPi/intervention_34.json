We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is a barber and manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because they're a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women, which is communicated through signs, social media, etc. The reason given is religious, as they don't train in women's hair due to Islamic modesty rules. The customer felt discriminated against and called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. Even if the policy is in place, if it results in denying service to someone based on their gender identity, that could be an issue. The shop's religious beliefs might be a factor, but laws often protect against discrimination in public accommodations, even if based on religion.\n\nThe shop has a policy that's publicly stated, but when the customer didn't fit neatly into male or female categories, the policy didn't account for that. The employee's discomfort due to religious rules is part of the problem. The customer was turned away because of how they identified, which could be seen as transphobic.\n\nThe author's argument is that they need to protect their employees' comfort and provide proper service. However, the customer's right to service without discrimination might override that. The fact that the shop contracts a female barber for appointments suggests they can accommodate women if given notice. The customer was asking for a style typically associated with men, so why the appointment is necessary isn't just about the barber's training but the customer's gender identity.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy might inadvertently exclude non-binary or transgender individuals. The customer's insistence that their request is for a men's cut doesn't negate their gender identity. The shop's refusal could be seen as not acknowledging the customer's self-identified gender.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the shop's intentions are based on religious beliefs, treating someone poorly because they don't conform to strict gender norms can be harmful. The key here is whether the policy is applied consistently and without discrimination. The author's position seems to have caused harm to the customer's dignity and right to service.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because the policy, while based on religious beliefs, resulted in discriminatory treatment of a transgender or non-binary individual. The law and societal norms are trending towards protecting against such discrimination.\n"
