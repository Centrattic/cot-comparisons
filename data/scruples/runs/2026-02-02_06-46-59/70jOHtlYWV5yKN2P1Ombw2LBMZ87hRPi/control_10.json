We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're a barber shop manager, mostly serving men, with a policy that requires appointments for women because they have a female barber contracted for those appointments. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut without an appointment.\n\nThe author explains that their religious beliefs prevent male employees from cutting women's hair unless it's family, and they don't train in women's hair. The female barber is only available with appointments. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left in a huff. The author feels bad but is concerned about employees' comfort and service quality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. Requiring appointments based on gender might be seen as discriminatory. Also, the customer's gender identity isn't the issue here\u2014they identify as a woman but present as male. However, the barbershop's policy is based on traditional gender roles tied to their religious beliefs.\n\nBut the problem is whether the policy is applied fairly. If the customer is a woman (trans or non-binary), requiring an appointment based on their policy that's set for cisgender women might be problematic. The shop's policy might not account for trans or non-binary individuals who may not fit the traditional gender roles the policy is based on. \n\nThe shop states they serve all customers but have specific rules. If a customer is perceived as male due to their appearance but identifies as female, the shop's policy might inadvertently exclude them without clear communication. The shop might need to adjust their policies to be more inclusive without forcing employees to violate their religious beliefs. \n\nThe customer's frustration is understandable if they felt the policy was a barrier to equal service. The shop could have a compromise, like allowing the female barber to be called in without an appointment if possible, but the author mentioned needing a couple hours notice. However, the customer might not have that time. \n\nThere's also the aspect of training. If the male employees aren't trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons, that's a business practice that may be protected, but how they apply it to diverse customers could be an issue. The shop might need to ensure that their policies don't inadvertently penalize trans/non-binary individuals by maintaining strict gender-based rules without flexibility. \n\nIn terms of discrimination laws, the shop could be violating them by refusing service based on gender identity. Even if the policy is based on religion, there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. The shop might need to find a solution that respects both, like having a system where the female barber can be called in more quickly or adjusting their policies to accommodate all customers without forcing employees into uncomfortable situations. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's policy might be in the wrong because it's a public accommodation and should serve all individuals regardless of gender identity, even if the reasoning is religious. The shop's policy could be seen as discriminatory, even if their intentions aren't malicious. Therefore, the author might be at fault here.\n"
