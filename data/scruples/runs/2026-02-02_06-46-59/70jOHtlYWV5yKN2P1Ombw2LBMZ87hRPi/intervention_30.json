We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men. They mention that they have one female stylist who works on an appointment basis, and this is advertised online and in signage. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a men's cut. The barbershop's policy requires appointments for women to accommodate the female stylist since the male staff aren't allowed to cut women's hair due to religious beliefs.\n\nThe key points here are the policy in place and the customer's gender identity. The customer isn't a woman according to their own identity but is considered male-passing. However, the barbershop's policy is based on biological sex as per the female stylist's role. The customer was upset, called the shop transphobic, and left in anger. The author feels bad but thinks employees' comfort and service quality matter.\n\nNow, considering the AITA scenario, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's policy is to require appointments for women, which they clearly state. The customer in question is a male-passing woman, so they might not fall under the policy's intended category. If the customer identifies as male and wants a men's cut, the barbershop's policy might be incorrectly applied here. The author's reasoning about religious beliefs and employee comfort might not hold up if the customer's gender identity is considered. The policy should perhaps be based on the customer's gender identity rather than perceived biology. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer based on their self-identification. However, the shop's policy is clear about requiring appointments for women, and if the customer is perceived as male, they might not need an appointment. The conflict arises from the shop's strict policy versus the customer's identity. It's a bit of a tricky situation, but the author's policy might have a loophole here.\n"
