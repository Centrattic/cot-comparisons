We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because they were a male-passing woman. The barbershop has a policy of requiring appointments for women because they have a female barber on contract, and the male barbers don't do women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop is Muslim, and their policy is based on religious beliefs about not touching women's hair unless it's family. They mention that the female barber is available by appointment. The customer in question identified as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's style haircut. The barbers didn't feel comfortable cutting their hair, so they couldn't proceed. The customer accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the barber) is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nFrom a religious standpoint, the shop's policy is based on their beliefs. They have a female barber available, and they make this clear in their advertising. So they're not refusing service to women in general; they have a system in place where women can get an appointment. The issue here is with a customer who might not fit neatly into the categories of male or female. The customer is male-passing but identifies as a woman and wanted a men's cut. \n\nBut religious exemptions for businesses have limits, especially in service industries. In many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, even if it's due to religious beliefs. For example, some states in the US have laws that prevent discrimination against transgender individuals. So if the customer is transgender and presenting as a woman but wants a men's cut, the shop might be required to serve them, regardless of their internal policies. \n\nHowever, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, and they have a female barber. The problem is whether the customer is considered a woman in this context. If the customer is a transgender woman, they might be considered a woman for the purposes of the shop's policy, hence requiring an appointment. But if they are non-binary or male-passing, it complicates things. The shop might not have a clear policy on gender identity, which could lead to conflict.\n\nThe author argues that their employees' comfort is a factor, but that might not be a valid reason to deny service. The shop's responsibility is to provide the service they advertise, even if it requires adjusting their policies. The fact that they can call in the female barber if given notice suggests that there's a way to accommodate the customer, but the customer refused to wait. \n\nOn the other hand, the shop's religious beliefs are a personal aspect. However, when operating a business, especially in a public space, there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory against women and transgender individuals if they're not allowed to receive services unless they book an appointment, which might not be accessible in an emergency or on short notice. \n\nThe customer's reaction of calling them transphobic and sexist might be an overreaction, but the shop's refusal could be perceived as such, especially if the customer's gender identity is valid. The shop's policy might not account for gender diversity beyond male and female, which could be a point of contention.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, the refusal to serve a transgender or gender-nonconforming customer could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that they have a female barber available but require appointments might not protect them from accusations of transphobia if the customer is within their rights to request services. The author might not be in the wrong if their policies are clearly stated and they have a way to provide the service (via the female barber), but the way they handled the situation could be problematic. However, depending on legal standards in their area, they might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's request when a solution was available, albeit requiring a bit of notice.\n"
