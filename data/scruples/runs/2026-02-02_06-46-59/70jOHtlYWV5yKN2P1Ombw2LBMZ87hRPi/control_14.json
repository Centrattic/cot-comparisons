We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is a barber shop managed by a Muslim barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the policy is for women to have appointments, and the customer was a male-passing woman. The customer felt it was transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies. The shop states they require appointments for women, which is clear on their website and signs. The reason given is both religious (not allowing male barbers to touch women's hair) and practical (different tools/products). The shop has a female barber available by appointment. The customer didn't make an appointment and wanted a men's cut, but the staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair due to religious reasons and lack of training.\n\nThe customer identified as a male-passing woman, so maybe they expected to be treated as a male customer. The shop's policy is based on their religious beliefs, which might be protected under discrimination laws in some places. However, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, even if it's a religious exemption. The shop is refusing service based on gender identity, which might be illegal. \n\nAlso, the policy of requiring appointments for women is in place to serve them, but the customer didn't follow the policy. However, if the customer's gender identity is male, but they are a woman, the shop's policy might not apply. But if they identify as non-binary or another gender, that's a different case. The question is whether the shop's policy allows for exceptions based on gender identity. \n\nThe shop could argue they have a religious exemption, but in some jurisdictions, that's not a valid defense against discrimination claims based on gender identity. Also, the shop is providing a service that's available to all, but their policy might inadvertently exclude transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. \n\nThe staff's comfort level is another point. If employees aren't trained or comfortable, the shop has a duty to provide the service or refer them to someone who can. Since they have a female barber by appointment, they could have offered to schedule her if given notice. The customer didn't want to wait, but the shop's policy requires appointments. \n\nThe key here is whether the refusal to serve was based on gender identity. If the customer is a trans man or non-binary, being denied service because the shop's policy treats them as female could be seen as discrimination. The shop's religious beliefs might not override anti-discrimination laws in this case. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the policy could be discriminatory against transgender individuals. Even if the policy states appointments for women, if the customer identifies as male, they might be entitled to the same service as any other male customer. However, if the shop's religion prohibits male employees from cutting women's hair, but the customer is a woman who passes as male, the shop might have a valid reason under their religious practices. But legal protections for trans people vary. In some places, it's illegal to discriminate against trans individuals. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on local laws. If the shop is in a place where trans discrimination is illegal, the author is in the wrong. If not, maybe not. However, the question is asking if the author is in the wrong in general. Considering that the shop could have accommodated by scheduling the female barber if given notice, and the customer was denied service without that option, the author might be at fault for not making an exception. But the shop's policy is clear, so maybe they aren't. This is a tough one, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they refused service based on gender identity without proper accommodation.\n"
