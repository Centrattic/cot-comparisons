We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a barber shop with a policy that requires appointments for women, and they have a female barber on call. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy is based on religious reasons, as the staff is mostly Muslim and they have rules about not cutting women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity. The Civil Rights Act might come into play here, as it prohibits discrimination in public accommodations. Even if the business has religious reasons, they can't use that as an excuse to deny service based on someone's gender. However, there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. I remember some cases where businesses were allowed to have religious policies, but if it's a public accommodation, the laws might require them to serve everyone regardless of their beliefs.\n\nNext, the customer's perspective. The person identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. If the shop is willing to serve men, then denying service based on gender identity could be discriminatory. However, if the shop's policy is that only the female barber can cut women's hair, but the customer is a trans man, maybe there's ambiguity here. But the customer is a woman in terms of legal gender, so the shop's policy might not account for that scenario.\n\nThe shop's policy mentions that they require appointments for women, but they state this publicly. The customer might have assumed they were a man and thus thought they could get a haircut without an appointment. The shop's policy might not be clear enough to customers who are gender non-conforming. Also, the shop is using the female barber for women, but if the customer is a trans man, maybe the shop should consider that their policy is outdated and doesn't accommodate gender diversity.\n\nThe employees' comfort and training are also factors. If the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons, but a trans man is seeking a men's cut, there's a conflict. The shop might need to adjust their policies to be more inclusive while respecting their faith. Maybe they can allow the female barber to serve trans men if they identify as men, which could be a middle ground.\n\nThe shop manager claims they feel bad but have to protect employees. However, denying service based on the customer's gender identity could be seen as discrimination. The customer was called transphobic and so on, which indicates that the shop's policy might not be inclusive enough.\n\nIn terms of the law, if the shop is a public accommodation, they must serve all customers regardless of the reason. Their religious beliefs might not override legal obligations. So the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer, even if the policy is stated. The policy could be discriminatory, especially if it's not clearly applied to all gender identities.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy of requiring appointments for women might inadvertently exclude trans men who are transitioning and need services typically associated with men. The shop's approach could be seen as not considering the nuances of gender identity, leading to discrimination against trans individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop has its religious reasons, their policy might be discriminatory under anti-discrimination laws. The author is likely in the wrong for not providing service to the customer based on gender identity, even if their policy is stated. The correct answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
