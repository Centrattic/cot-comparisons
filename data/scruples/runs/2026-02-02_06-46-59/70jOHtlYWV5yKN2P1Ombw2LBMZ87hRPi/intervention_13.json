We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the barber manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because they only have a female barber available on a contract basis. The customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc. The manager explains the policy is due to religious reasons and the staff isn't trained for women's hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also covers public accommodations, so refusing service based on gender might be illegal. Even if the policy is stated upfront, it might not protect them from discrimination claims. The customer's gender identity here is a key point\u2014since they're a woman presenting as a male but identifying as such, the refusal to serve them without an appointment could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the policy isn't applied consistently or if there's an alternative (like the contracted female barber).\n\nReligious exemptions can sometimes apply, but they're not absolute. Courts often balance religious freedom against anti-discrimination laws. The shop's religious beliefs might be a factor, but they can't override the customer's right to equal service. Also, the manager mentions that the policy is in place for employees' comfort and training, but that doesn't necessarily justify discrimination. The customer's right to access services should be protected regardless of staff training issues.\n\nThe manager argues that they need a couple of hours' notice to call in the female employee. But if the customer didn't have that notice, the shop could have offered to schedule an appointment for a later time instead of turning them away. The fact that they required an appointment might be a policy, but if the customer was willing to wait, perhaps they could adjust. However, the policy is clear about appointments, so maybe they can enforce that. Still, if the customer's gender identity isn't known until they arrive, the policy might be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy states they serve all sorts of customers, which might imply inclusivity. The customer felt discriminated against, which could lead to negative publicity or legal issues. Even if the policy is stated, it's possible that the implementation is discriminatory. Also, considering the male-passing aspect, the customer might not have identified as a woman when booking, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn summary, while the shop has stated policies and religious reasons, the refusal to serve a trans woman under the guise of policy might be seen as discriminatory. The legal perspective leans towards the customer's rights here. The manager might not be in the wrong in their own eyes due to religious and business policies, but legally and ethically, they could be violating anti-discrimination laws. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
