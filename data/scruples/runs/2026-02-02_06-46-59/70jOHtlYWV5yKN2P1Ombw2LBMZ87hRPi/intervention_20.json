We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men and employs Muslim staff. They have a policy requiring appointments for women, using a contracted female stylist. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a haircut without an appointment. The staff didn't offer the service because of religious restrictions and lack of training in women's hair. The customer accused them of transphobia and sexism.\n\nFirst, the barbershop's policy is clear on their website and signage about requiring appointments for women. They have a contracted female stylist for that purpose. The staff's refusal is based on both religious beliefs (not touching women's hair unless family) and practical reasons (different tools/products). The customer, however, felt discriminated against, leading to accusations of transphobia and sexism.\n\nThe key points here are: the shop's policy was advertised, they have a specific process for women's haircuts, and the staff's refusal was based on both religious and practical reasons. The customer was informed of the policy but insisted. The staff didn't want to put the employee in an uncomfortable position, which is a valid concern as employees should feel safe and comfortable in their work environment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The policy is in place, and the customer wasn't there for an appointment. The staff's refusal is based on their religious beliefs and operational procedures. However, the customer is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style, which complicates the situation. The issue might be that the shop's policy is based on gender (as indicated by the appointment system for women), which could be seen as discriminatory regardless of the reasoning. But the shop is transparent about their policy. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression, so if the policy is based on perceived gender, it might be problematic. However, the shop is also accommodating their beliefs by having a contracted female stylist. The problem arises when the customer's identity doesn't fit neatly into the policy. The staff's refusal could be seen as not providing equal service, especially if the customer is trans or non-binary. \n\nBut the staff is also acting within their religious beliefs and the shop's stated policy. The manager is trying to protect their employees from feeling uncomfortable. The conflict is between the business's religious practices and the customer's rights. Depending on the jurisdiction, religious exemptions might be allowed, but in many cases, businesses must serve all customers regardless of gender identity. \n\nGiven that the policy is publicly stated and the customer was aware, but the staff's refusal led to accusations of prejudice, the answer might be nuanced. However, since the shop has a specific process for women (appointment with a female stylist), and the customer didn't book an appointment, the staff is following policy. But if the policy is based solely on gender without considering gender identity, that's where the issue lies. The author's stance is to enforce the policy as written, but in doing so, they might be excluding people who don't fit the traditional gender categories.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are based on the shop's policies and religious beliefs, but they may inadvertently discriminate against trans or non-binary individuals. So, there's a case to be made that the author is in the wrong for not being flexible with the policy in this situation. However, if the policy is clearly communicated and the customer was informed, the shop might not be at fault. It's a tricky balance between religious practices and equal service.\n"
