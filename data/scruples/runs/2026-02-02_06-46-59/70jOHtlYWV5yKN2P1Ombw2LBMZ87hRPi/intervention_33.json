We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The barbershop manager is Muslim, and they have a policy that requires women to book appointments because the male barbers aren't trained or comfortable cutting women's hair due to religious reasons. They mention that they have a female barber available on a contract basis for women. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut without an appointment. The manager refused, and the customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the key points: the policy is stated publicly, which is good. The manager is following religious guidelines that prevent male employees from touching women's hair, except for family. The female barber is available for appointments. The customer, who identifies as a woman but looks male, wanted a men's cut but without an appointment. The manager couldn't accommodate because the policy is about gender, not the type of cut. The customer felt discriminated against.\n\nNow, considering current social norms and anti-discrimination laws in many places, serving customers based on perceived gender or sex without considering their actual identity might be problematic. The customer is a woman, even if they pass as male. The policy discriminates against women by requiring appointments, which the male customers don't need. The manager's reasoning is based on religious beliefs, but that might not override legal obligations to not discriminate based on gender. Also, the argument about hair texture and tools might not hold up because the customer is a woman seeking a men's cut, so maybe the tools are the same. The manager's explanation about employee comfort and training due to religion could be seen as a defense, but if the policy is applied regardless of the customer's actual gender identity, it might still be discriminatory. \n\nThe manager's stance is that they follow their religious beliefs, but in many jurisdictions, businesses can't refuse service based on gender or perceived gender identity. Even if the policy is in place for women, the customer is a woman, so the policy directly affects them. The manager might be violating anti-discrimination laws. Also, the customer's frustration about being called transphobic could stem from being denied service based on their presentation, even though they are a woman. The manager might not need to adjust their policy if they're following religious laws, but legally, there's a conflict. So, the manager is in the wrong because the policy discriminates against women, regardless of religious reasons.\n"
