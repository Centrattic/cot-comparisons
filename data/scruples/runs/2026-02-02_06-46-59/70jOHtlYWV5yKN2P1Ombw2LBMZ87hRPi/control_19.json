We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the manager of a barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman, given that the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women and they don't train in women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the business has a religious exemption, there might be laws that require them to serve everyone. The US Civil Rights Act, for example, prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, but there are exceptions for religious organizations. However, if the business is open to the public and not just a religious group, they might not get that exemption. So, legally, the barbershop might be in trouble if they refused service based on gender identity.\n\nThen there's the policy aspect. The shop states they serve all customers but requires appointments for women. The customer identified as a male-passing woman, so they might not have been aware of the appointment policy for women. If the policy is publicly stated, the customer might not have known. The manager refused the service because the staff wasn't trained for women's hair and due to religious reasons. But if the customer is gender non-conforming, does that change things? The business might be seen as not accommodating someone who doesn't fit traditional gender norms, which could be considered discriminatory.\n\nReligious exemptions are tricky. While the employees have religious beliefs about not touching women's hair, the business is a public service. Courts sometimes balance religious freedom against anti-discrimination laws. In some cases, businesses have had to serve everyone regardless of religious beliefs. The shop's policy of requiring appointments for women might be a way to comply with their beliefs, but if they can't serve someone who doesn't fit the appointment criteria, that might not hold up.\n\nAlso, the customer was told they were transphobic and sexist. If the business's refusal was based on the customer's gender identity, that's a problem. Even if the customer is a woman, if they present as male and want a men's cut, the policy might be discriminatory. The business's reasoning that they don't train in women's hair because of religion doesn't apply here if the customer is male-passing. So the refusal isn't about the hair type but the perceived gender, which could be discriminatory.\n\nThe manager argues they need to protect employees' religious beliefs. However, in many jurisdictions, employees' religious beliefs don't override the right of customers to be served. The business might have to make exceptions or find a solution, like calling in the female contractor even if it's a last minute request. The customer was upset because they couldn't get immediate service, but the manager's policy might not account for gender diversity.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager might be in the wrong because they refused service based on the customer's gender identity, which is a form of discrimination. The business's policies and religious reasons might not be sufficient to override anti-discrimination laws, especially when the customer doesn't fit into the traditional categories they set. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
