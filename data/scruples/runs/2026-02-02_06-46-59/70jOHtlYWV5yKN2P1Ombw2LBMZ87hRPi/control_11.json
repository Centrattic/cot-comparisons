We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the barber manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut, but the shop requires appointments for women because of religious reasons and not training staff in women's haircuts. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's policies. They mention they have a woman barber available on appointment, and they require women to book appointments. The customer didn't have an appointment, so according to their policy, they couldn't provide the service. The manager also mentions that the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, so even if the customer identified as male-passing, the staff wasn't comfortable.\n\nBut then, the customer is a trans person. The manager's reasoning is about policies and religious practices, but does that apply here? If the customer is a woman who presents as male and wants a men's cut, does the policy still require an appointment? The shop's policy is for women, so if the customer is a woman, they should book an appointment regardless. The trans aspect might complicate things because the customer's gender identity doesn't fit neatly into their policies.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if they refuse service based on gender identity. Even though they have a policy, the way they enforce it could be problematic. If the customer is a woman (trans or cis), the policy is in place to direct them to the female barber. However, if the customer is a woman passing as male but still identifies as female, the policy would still require an appointment. \n\nBut the customer argues they wanted a men's cut, so maybe they don't want to be categorized as a female customer. The shop's policy is based on biological sex, not gender identity. However, in many places, anti-discrimination laws protect gender identity, so refusing service based on that could be an issue.\n\nThe manager's stance is about respecting employees' religious beliefs and not forcing them to cut women's hair. That's a valid concern, but they could have offered to book an appointment with the female barber instead. The customer was upset and called them transphobic, which might be valid if the policy doesn't account for gender identity.\n\nI think the key points are: the policy is based on biological sex, not gender identity, which might not be inclusive. The shop could be seen as discriminatory if they don't make an exception for a trans customer who identifies as male. Also, the customer's request for a men's cut might indicate they want to be treated as male, so the policy shouldn't apply. \n\nHowever, the shop does have a female barber available on appointment. The manager could have offered to book an appointment even if the customer is a trans woman, but if the policy strictly requires appointments for women regardless, they might not have flexibility. \n\nThe main issue is whether refusing service based on the customer's gender identity (as opposed to biological sex) is discriminatory. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex and doesn't consider gender identity, that could be problematic. The manager might not be in the wrong if the policy is clear and applied consistently, but the way they handled it could come across as transphobic if they don't make accommodations for gender identity.\n"
