We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women, which they can't accommodate on short notice.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: they require appointments for women because their Muslim faith prohibits male employees from cutting women's hair, except for family. They have a female barber available by appointment. The customer, identifying as male-passing, argued they wanted a men's style, but the staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair regardless. The customer accused them of being transphobic, etc., and left angry.\n\nThe key points here are the shop's religious practices and their established policies. They made it clear on their website and signage that appointments are needed for women. The customer might not have known this, but the shop is within their right to enforce their policy based on their beliefs. However, there's a potential issue with how they handled the customer's identity. If the customer is non-binary or transgender, the shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic, especially if they're presenting as male. But since the shop's policy is based on religious rules (male employees can't cut women's hair), and the customer was perceived as female, they might be acting on that policy regardless of the customer's gender identity.\n\nBut the problem arises when the customer's gender expression is male-passing. The shop might be conflating biological sex with gender identity. If the customer identifies as male, then the shop's policy based on sex (women) could be problematic. However, the shop's policy is about the biological sex of the customer, not their gender identity. Still, in many places, anti-discrimination laws protect against gender identity and expression, so refusing service based on someone's appearance without knowing their actual identity might be an issue.\n\nAlso, the shop claims they can't accommodate women because of religious reasons, but they do have a female barber available by appointment. So technically, they can serve women if the appointment is made. The customer might not have known this, but the shop should inform them politely and offer to schedule an appointment. However, the customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic, which might not be justified if the policy is strictly about sex, not gender identity.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's employees are uncomfortable cutting the customer's hair because of both religious reasons and the difference in hair types. But the customer is perceived as male, so the religious rule about not cutting women's hair shouldn't apply. Unless the shop insists that the policy is based on the customer's biological sex, regardless of how they present. This could be a point of contention if the customer is transgender and identifies as male. In that case, the shop's policy based on biological sex could be discriminatory.\n\nSo, considering all that, the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, which are protected, but if the customer is transgender and identifies as male, refusing service could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the shop's policy is clearly communicated and based on biological sex, they might not be in the wrong. The confusion here is whether the customer is transgender or non-binary. If the customer is cisgender and female but presents as male, the shop's policy applies. But if they are transgender and identify as male, then the shop's policy might be discriminatory. The shop might not have enough information to make that distinction, but they still have a policy in place.\n\nThe author's defense is that they need appointments for women because of religious rules and employee comfort. The customer was told they couldn't be served that day but could book an appointment. However, the customer felt it was a refusal based on their gender identity. The key issue is whether the shop's policy is based on biological sex (which is allowed under religious freedom) or gender identity (which might not be). If it's the former, they're not in the wrong. If it's the latter, they could be. The answer hinges on that distinction. Since the shop's policy is about women (biological sex) and they have a way to serve them, the author might not be in the wrong. The customer might have misunderstood the policy. So the answer could be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
