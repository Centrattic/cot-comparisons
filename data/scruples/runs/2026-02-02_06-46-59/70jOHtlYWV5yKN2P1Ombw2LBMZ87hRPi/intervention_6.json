We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a barber who refused to cut a male-passing woman's hair because they only serve women by appointment through a contracted female barber. The barbershop is primarily Muslim, and their policy is based on religious beliefs regarding not touching women's hair unless it's family. The customer got upset, called them transphobic and sexist, and left in a huff. The author feels bad but is defending their policy to protect employees and ensure proper service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. Even if the policy is rooted in religion, there might be anti-discrimination laws that override that. The customer is a male-passing woman, which complicates things. If the policy is only for cisgender women, does that apply here? Also, the shop is stating their policy clearly on their website and signage, which is good, but maybe they didn't consider cases where someone's gender isn't immediately clear. \n\nThe author mentions that the appointment system is for their benefit, not the customers', so they can call in the female barber. But the customer didn't want to wait and felt it should be okay because they wanted a men's cut. The employees were uncomfortable due to religious reasons. However, refusing service based on gender, even with a policy, can be problematic. The customer might see it as discrimination regardless of the reasoning. \n\nThe key points here are religious freedom vs. anti-discrimination laws. In some regions, religious exemptions might be allowed, but in others, they aren't. The shop's policy is explicitly stated, but if a customer doesn't know or doesn't agree, it's still an issue. Also, the fact that they train employees differently for men and women's hair could be a legitimate concern for service quality, but that doesn't necessarily justify discrimination.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if local laws protect against gender identity discrimination. If the customer was transgender or non-binary, the shop's policy could be seen as excluding them. Even if the policy is for cis women, the customer's gender identity might not align with the shop's policy, leading to discrimination. Also, the author's reasoning about employee comfort and service standards might not hold up if the customer is within their legal rights.\n\nOn the other hand, if the shop is transparent about their policy and the customer didn't book an appointment, maybe they are within their rights to deny service. But the customer was present in the shop, possibly not aware of the appointment-only policy for women, which they might not have seen as applying to them. The shop's signage might not cover this specific case, leading to confusion.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they refused service to a customer who fits the appearance of a man but is a woman, possibly transgender, and their policy may not account for that. Even if the policy is clear, it's discriminatory to deny service based on gender identity or expression. The shop's religious beliefs don't necessarily override legal obligations to serve all customers, especially when the customer's identity complicates the policy. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
