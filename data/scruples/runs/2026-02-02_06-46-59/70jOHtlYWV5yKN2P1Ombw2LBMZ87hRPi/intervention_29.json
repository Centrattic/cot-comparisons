We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the barber (the author) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop's policy requires appointments for women because they have a female barber contracted for that. The shop is primarily Muslim, and their religious beliefs prevent male barbers from cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's policies and the reasons behind them. They clearly state on their website and signage that they require appointments for women, which is a public policy. The reason given is both religious (not cutting women's hair) and practical (different tools/products needed). The author mentions that the staff isn't trained in women's haircuts, which might be due to the religious restriction. \n\nThe customer, who identifies as a male-passing woman, wanted a men's style cut. The shop's policy is about appointments for women, regardless of the customer's gender identity. The customer argued it shouldn't matter since they wanted a men's cut, but the policy is in place to ensure that women can be served by the female barber. The author couldn't make an exception because they had to follow their policy and couldn't have a male barber cut a woman's hair.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can have policies based on gender, especially when it comes to services like haircuts, provided they're applied consistently. However, if the policy is based on religion and not on the customer's gender identity, that's a different angle. The key here is whether the policy is discriminatory. The shop is serving all genders, but only requires appointments for women because of the religious rules and the need for a female barber. The customer was told they can't be served on the spot, which they perceived as discrimination.\n\nThe author claims they're not transphobic, but the customer felt that way. If the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, does that affect the policy? The shop's policy is based on the customer's biological sex (as they require a female barber for women), but if the customer is a transgender woman, the policy might conflict with their identity. However, the shop's policy is clear and based on existing practices, and they can't provide the service without the female barber being available. \n\nThere's also the aspect of religious accommodation. The shop's employees have varying levels of religious adherence, but the policy is in place to respect the religious beliefs of the staff. The customer, however, might not see it that way and feel their needs are being ignored. The author had to balance respecting their employees' beliefs with serving the customer, which led to the conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the legal context and societal norms. In some places, businesses can have policies based on gender for certain services, but if the policy leads to discrimination against transgender individuals, it could be problematic. However, the shop's policy is not about the customer's gender identity but about the gender of the barber, which is a different issue. The author tried to explain their policy and offered a solution (appointment with the female barber), but the customer refused. \n\nThe author might be in the right if the policy is consistently applied and not based on the customer's gender identity. However, if the policy is perceived as excluding transgender individuals, that's a different matter. The key is whether the shop's policy is in line with anti-discrimination laws and whether they can make exceptions for certain cases without compromising their beliefs. The answer isn't black and white, but considering the shop's stated policies and the reasons provided, the author might not be in the wrong. They tried to explain their stance and offer an alternative, which shows they're trying to accommodate within their constraints.\n"
