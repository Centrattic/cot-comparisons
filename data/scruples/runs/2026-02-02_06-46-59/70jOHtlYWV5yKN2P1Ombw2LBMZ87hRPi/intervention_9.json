We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a barber and manager at a shop where they mostly serve men. They have a policy that requires women to make appointments because of religious reasons and the need for a female barber. The situation here is a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a men's cut but not making an appointment. The barbers refused to cut her hair, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies in place. The shop openly states they have a female barber on an appointment basis and mentions that on their website and signs. The customer might not have read the policy, but the shop did make it public. The reason given is religious\u2014specifically, the staff not being allowed to touch women's hair unless family. Also, they mention different tools and products, so they might not be trained for women's hair. \n\nBut the customer is a male-passing woman. So, in terms of gender, maybe the policy is based on the customer's gender as per the shop's understanding. The staff isn't comfortable, and they have a system to ensure women can be served. The issue is whether the customer's gender identity affects the policy. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived, then the male-passing woman might be considered male, but the staff might still be uncomfortable because they perceive her as a woman. \n\nThe customer felt discriminated against and accused them of being transphobic and sexist. The question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a business ethics standpoint, if the policy is clearly stated and the customer didn't follow it, maybe the shop isn't at fault. However, if the policy is based on the customer's gender in a way that's discriminatory, especially considering the customer is transgender or non-binary, that could be a problem. \n\nReligious exemptions are sometimes allowed in business practices, but there are limits. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. If the shop's policy excludes transgender or non-binary individuals, even if they are male-passing, that could be seen as discrimination. \n\nThe shop's reasoning includes both religious beliefs and lack of training. However, if the policy is applied regardless of the customer's identity, as long as they are perceived as female, that might not hold up. For example, if a cisgender man asks for a women's cut, they might still require an appointment. But in this case, the customer is a woman who wants a men's cut. The policy is about gender, not the type of cut. \n\nThe staff's discomfort due to religious reasons might be a valid belief, but if it leads to refusing service to a customer based on their gender identity, it could be problematic. The shop's policy could be seen as transgender-inclusive if they consider the customer's gender as male, but if they are using biological sex instead of gender identity, that could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the shop is providing a service (haircut) that the customer is entitled to, and refusing based on gender might be illegal in some jurisdictions. The shop's reason for the policy (religious and training) might not be sufficient to justify discrimination. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to refuse the haircut based on the customer's gender (as perceived) could be seen as discriminatory, even if they have a policy in place. Therefore, the author might be at fault. However, if the policy is clearly communicated and the customer didn't make an appointment, it's a bit more nuanced. But the key issue is whether the policy is discriminatory, especially towards transgender or non-binary individuals. Given that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
