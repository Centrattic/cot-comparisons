We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a barber shop that's mostly for men, run by Muslim employees. They have a policy that women need appointments because they only have a female barber who's contracted. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut without an appointment. The staff didn't want to cut her hair because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, Muslim rules about not touching women's hair unless they're family. Also, they mention that the tools and products are different, and they don't train for women's hair, hence the appointment system.\n\nThe customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left. The author is asking if they're at fault. So the question is whether the author is wrong for not cutting the customer's hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider religious practices. In Islam, men are discouraged from touching women who are not their mahrams (close family). So the staff's refusal is based on religious beliefs. The shop has a policy in place that's communicated through their website and signage, which requires women to book appointments with their female barber. The customer might not have known about the appointment system or didn't understand the policy, leading to conflict.\n\nHowever, the customer identifies as a trans man or male-passing woman. The shop's policy is based on the customer's sex, not gender. If the customer is a transgender man, they might see the policy as discriminatory based on gender identity. The shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic if they're applying the policy based on assigned sex rather than gender identity. But since the policy is about the tools and staff training, maybe they have a legitimate service reason. However, the staff's refusal could also be seen as enforcing a policy that's both religious and based on gender stereotypes, which might be problematic under anti-discrimination laws, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nIn the US, for example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. So if the shop is refusing service based on gender identity, that could be illegal. However, if it's based on religious practices, there might be some protections under the Free Exercise Clause, but that's a balancing act. The shop has to follow anti-discrimination laws while also practicing their religion. The conflict arises when their religious practices lead to discrimination against transgender individuals.\n\nThe shop's policy might be considered discriminatory because they're applying different rules based on gender. Also, the argument about different tools and products is a bit weak because if they can handle men's hair, they should be able to handle a male-passing woman's hair. The staff's discomfort is based on religious reasons, but that doesn't necessarily justify discrimination. There's also the aspect of the customer being told they need to book an appointment, but the shop doesn't have the female barber available on short notice, which could be inconvenient but not necessarily wrong if the policy is clearly stated.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop is trying to accommodate by mentioning they can call in the female barber with notice. The customer might not have been willing to wait, leading to conflict. The shop is also considering employee comfort and religious beliefs, which are important. But the customer's experience is negative, and being accused of being transphobic is serious. The key points are whether the policy is applied fairly and if there's a reasonable accommodation made. The shop is offering a solution (appointment with a female barber), but the customer wasn't willing to accept it. If the shop is willing to make an exception for the customer, but the customer doesn't want to wait, the shop might not be in the wrong. However, if the policy is rigid and doesn't allow for exceptions, it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the shop's policy is based on both religious beliefs and operational reasons. The customer, as a male-passing woman, might feel that the policy is targeting their gender identity. If the shop is enforcing the policy without considering the customer's gender identity, they could be in the wrong. However, if they are following their stated policy and providing a way to still serve the customer (through the female barber), then they might not be. The answer depends on the balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, so the shop's policy might be illegal even if it's based on religion. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that discriminates against transgender customers.\n"
