We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author, who is a barber and manager of a primarily Muslim barbershop, was in the wrong for not cutting a male-passing woman's hair. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because they only have one female barber available on a contract basis. The customer, who identified as a male-passing woman, wanted a men's haircut but didn't have an appointment. The staff, adhering to religious beliefs, felt they couldn't touch women's hair unless it's family, so they refused. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. The shop is primarily Muslim, and their religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair unless it's family. However, the customer is a woman who presents as male. The staff's policy is based on their faith, but they have a process in place to accommodate women through appointments with their female barber. The author mentions that the shop isn't trained in women's haircuts and requires appointments to ensure proper service.\n\nThe key points here are the religious policy and the existing appointment system. The customer didn't have an appointment, so the shop couldn't accommodate them. The shop's policy is clear in their advertising, so the customer should have known. But the customer identified as a woman who might be perceived as male, which complicates things. The shop's refusal could be seen as discrimination if the customer is trans, as they might be seeking services in alignment with their gender identity.\n\nHowever, the shop does have a process to accommodate women, even if it's a contracted barber. The author states that they could have called in the female barber with a couple of hours' notice, but the customer was unwilling to wait. The policy is in place to manage their services within their religious constraints. The staff's discomfort is tied to both religious beliefs and lack of training for women's hair.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects: In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. If the shop is refusing service to a transgender or gender non-conforming person, that might be illegal, even if based on religion. However, the shop has a system in place to serve women with the contracted barber. The issue here is whether the customer is considered a woman under the shop's policy. Since they are a woman, even if presenting as male, the shop's policy requires an appointment for women. The customer didn't have one, so the shop followed protocol.\n\nBut there's a gray area. If the customer is trans and identifies as a man, does the shop's policy apply? If the shop serves men, and the customer is a trans man, then they might be considered a man, thus not requiring an appointment. However, if the shop's policy is based on the customer's biological sex rather than gender identity, that could be problematic. The shop's policy states they serve mostly men, with appointments for women. If the customer is a woman (biologically), even if they pass as male, they might still fall under the appointment system. The shop's refusal might be based on biological sex, not gender identity, but that could still be discriminatory if the customer is trans.\n\nThe staff's religious beliefs are a factor, but in many jurisdictions, businesses can't use religious exemptions to discriminate. There's also the aspect of public accommodation laws. If the shop is a public business, they must serve all customers regardless of gender identity. Refusing service based on religious beliefs might not be a valid defense if the customer is part of a protected class.\n\nThe shop's argument is that they can't train staff in women's haircuts due to religious reasons and have a system to handle women. But if the customer is a woman, even if passing as male, the system should still apply. However, if the customer is trans and identifies as male, the shop might be required to serve them as they would any other male customer. The confusion here is about the customer's gender identity vs. biological sex, and how the shop's policies are structured.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy is clear, but if they refused service to a trans person because they didn't fit into their appointment system, that could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that they could have arranged for the female barber with notice, but the customer stormed out, complicates things. The shop might be in the right based on their stated policy and religious constraints, but if the customer is trans, they might have a claim of discrimination. However, the shop does have a process to serve women, so the issue is whether the customer was correctly categorized. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex, then the customer was correctly placed in the women's appointment system. If they were trans and the shop refused based on gender identity, that's different. The answer hinges on the customer's gender identity and the shop's policy basis. Given the information, the shop followed their policy, but there's a risk of discrimination if the policy is based on gender identity. However, the shop's policy is based on biological sex (as the appointment is for women), so the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a nuance here that might depend on local laws and how the policy is applied.\n"
