We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a barber shop with a policy of requiring appointments for women, and a customer who is a male-passing woman not getting a haircut. The barbers, being Muslim, have a religious rule against touching women's hair except for family, and they don't train in women's hair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The shop's policy is publicly stated, which is good for transparency. The customer, however, identifies as non-binary or a woman who passes as a man, and wants a men's haircut. The staff's refusal is based on both religious beliefs and lack of training. The customer took offense, calling the shop transphobic and sexist.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are. Let me think about legal and ethical aspects. In many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the shop has a policy, if they can't serve someone because of their gender identity, that might be a problem. The customer is a valid person regardless of how they present, and the staff's refusal could be seen as discrimination if they're not making exceptions or not offering alternative solutions.\n\nThe shop does have a female barber available on appointment, but the customer didn't book one. However, the customer might not have known about this policy or might not be able to wait. The author mentions needing a couple hours notice to call the female employee, but the customer was upset and left. The shop's policy is in place for all customers, but maybe there's a lack of flexibility here. Also, the staff's personal discomfort due to religious beliefs versus the customer's rights is a sensitive area. \n\nReligious exemptions might not protect businesses from discrimination claims if they can't serve people based on gender identity. For example, in some U.S. states, Title VII protections extend to gender identity. If the shop's policy is applied rigidly without accommodation, they could be violating anti-discrimination laws. Additionally, the shop's claim about needing different products and tools for women might not hold up if the customer is presenting as a man and asking for a men's cut, which could be served with the existing tools. The staff's lack of training in women's hair could be a valid business reason if they can't provide the same quality, but if the customer is seeking a men's service, maybe the staff can handle it. \n\nThe staff's personal beliefs might conflict with their job duties. Employers might be responsible for ensuring employees don't refuse service based on personal prejudices, even if those are religious. Plus, the shop manager's responsibility is to balance employee comfort with customer service, but if that leads to excluding customers, there's a problem. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in a tough spot. But legally and ethically, if the customer is being discriminated against because of their gender identity, the shop is in the wrong. The policy might not be applied fairly, and the refusal to accommodate could be discriminatory. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
