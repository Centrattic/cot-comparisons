We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a manager at a barbershop that's mostly for men. They have a woman barber who works on an appointment basis, and they advertise that. The main issue is when a customer, a male-passing woman, came in without an appointment and wanted a men's haircut. The employees didn't want to cut her hair because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, the belief that they shouldn't touch women's hair unless it's family. The author tried to explain the policy, but the customer got angry and called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies in place. The barbershop clearly states that appointments are required for women. They have a female barber available for those appointments. So the policy is publicized and seems to be in place for both religious reasons and the practical aspect of different hair types. The customer didn't book an appointment, so maybe the issue is that they didn't follow the procedure. But the customer might argue that their gender identity isn't recognized under the policy, hence the refusal to serve them as a \"man\" even though they are a woman.\n\nReligious beliefs can sometimes be a defense, but there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. The author's policy might be based on their faith, but if that results in denying service to a transgender man or a nonbinary person, it could be problematic. The key here is whether the policy is applied in a way that's inclusive of all genders. If the policy is based on the customer's biological sex, it might not account for trans or nonbinary individuals who might not book appointments because the policy isn't clear or inclusive.\n\nThe author's rationale is that they need to protect their employees' comfort and provide the correct service. However, the customer felt discriminated against. The question is whether the author's actions were based on a legitimate business policy or a discriminatory one. If the policy is rigid and doesn't consider the customer's gender identity, it could be seen as transphobic. The author might have thought they were following the policy, but if the policy is outdated or not inclusive, that's an issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the female barber is available on appointment. The problem is that the customer didn't have an appointment, so the author couldn't just book her in. But maybe the author could have offered to make an exception or communicated the policy more clearly. The customer might have felt they were being treated differently because of their gender identity, even if the author's intention was to follow the policy and religious guidelines.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, in many jurisdictions, refusing service based on gender identity is illegal. So even if the policy is based on religious beliefs, it might not hold up legally. The author's employees' discomfort is one thing, but the business could be liable for discrimination. The author might be in the wrong if their policy leads to discrimination against transgender or nonbinary individuals.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because the policy as applied could be discriminatory. Even if the policy is clearly stated, it's possible that the policy's enforcement is not inclusive of all customers' identities. The author could be seen as upholding a policy that, while based on their religious beliefs, results in discrimination against others. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
