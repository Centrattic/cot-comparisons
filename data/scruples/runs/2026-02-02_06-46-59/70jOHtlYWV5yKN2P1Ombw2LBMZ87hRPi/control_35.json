We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager, primarily Muslim, with a policy that women need appointments because they have a female stylist contracted. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a men's cut. The shop's policy is in place because male barbers can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, and they don't train in women's hair.\n\nSo the customer came in without an appointment, and the staff wasn't comfortable doing the cut. The customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc. The manager felt bad but had to consider employees and service quality.\n\nFirst, the policy of requiring appointments for women is stated publicly. If the customer didn't make an appointment, then technically they didn't follow the shop's policy. However, the customer identifies as male-passing, which complicates things. The shop's policy is based on religious practices, which they have a right to uphold, but they also need to comply with anti-discrimination laws. In many places, refusing service based on gender identity or sex could be illegal, even if it's due to religious beliefs. \n\nThe key points here are whether the shop's policy is discriminatory. The shop claims they can't cut women's hair because of religion, but the customer is presenting as male, so the shop might not see them as a woman. However, if the customer identifies as non-binary or transgender, the shop's policy could be seen as excluding them based on gender identity. \n\nThe shop's reasoning is that they have a female stylist for women, but the customer is male-passing and wants a men's cut. If the shop doesn't train in women's hair, but the customer is male, maybe they could serve them. But the staff's discomfort comes from religious reasons. However, if the customer is male, then the religious rule about men not touching women's hair doesn't apply. There's confusion here about the customer's gender, which complicates the policy application. \n\nThe shop might be in the wrong if they denied service to someone who identifies as male or non-binary based on the customer's appearance. Also, the policy of requiring appointments for women could be discriminatory if applied rigidly without accommodations. Additionally, the shop's reasoning about hair texture and tools might be a stretch, as hair is hair regardless of gender, unless there's a specific religious reason for different tools. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity or expression. So even if the shop has a policy, if they apply it in a way that discriminates against transgender or non-binary individuals, they could be violating laws. The manager's decision to not cut the hair, leading to accusations of transphobia, might be justified in the shop's eyes, but legally and socially, they might be in the wrong by not accommodating the customer's identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the policy may be discriminatory against trans or non-binary individuals, even if the shop's intention is based on religious beliefs. Laws often require accommodations for gender identity, and the shop's policy could be seen as excluding such customers.\n"
