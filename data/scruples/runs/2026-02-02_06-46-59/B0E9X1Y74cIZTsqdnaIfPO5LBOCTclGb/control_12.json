Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being asked about their weight by a guy, which made them uncomfortable. They responded by asking him about his dick size, and then some of his friends are calling them a bitch for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the interactions. The guy asked the author how much they weigh, which the author found personal and uncomfortable. Weight is a sensitive topic for many people, so that's understandable. The author answered but then the guy made a comment comparing their weight, which the author interpreted as him implying they were fat. The author then asked why he asked, and he justified it by saying it's okay for men to comment on women's weight if they can help it (like weight vs. height). \n\nThen the author asked him about his dick size, which embarrassed him and he didn't respond. The friends of the guy are saying the author overreacted because they knew he was insecure about his size and used that against him. \n\nNow, the key points: Was the author wrong to respond to the guy's personal question with another personal question? The guy started by asking her weight, which she found uncomfortable. His comment about her weight being an \"ok weight\" was harsh and dismissive of her feelings. She then asked him about his dick size, which is a personal topic, but it's a way to mirror his behavior and make him see the inconsiderateness of his actions. \n\nBut is that appropriate? In social interactions, when someone crosses a boundary, responding in kind can sometimes be a way to show the other person how they were treated. However, it can also be seen as retaliating, especially if it's a sensitive topic for the other person. The author's friends are saying she used his insecurity against him, which might be true, but they didn't consider her feelings when he asked a personal question.\n\nThe guy didn't apologize, and the author was trying to make him understand her perspective. The friends' reaction is problematic because they're defending him without fully understanding her side. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for asking the question. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone their weight is generally considered intrusive unless it's a close friend. Similarly, asking about someone's genital size is extremely personal and not appropriate. However, the author's action here was a reaction to the guy's inconsiderate question. The key here is that the guy initiated the personal question, and the author's response was a way to highlight the double standard. \n\nBut some might argue that the author shouldn't have asked because it's a sensitive topic for him, which the friends are pointing out. However, the guy didn't apologize for his own behavior, so the author was trying to make him see the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were a response to the guy's inappropriate question. While asking about someone's genital size is not a typical response, it's a way to show the hypocrisy of the guy's actions. The friends are wrong to label her as the asshole because the guy was the one who started the conversation with a personal and potentially hurtful question. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
