Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user asked if the author is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, there's a guy and a girl on a date. The guy starts talking about a fitness post, mentions a woman's weight and her lifting capacity. Then he asks the girl how much she weighs. She's uncomfortable, says \"excuse me?\" but answers. Then he comments that she weighs more than him. She gets angry and asks why he asked, he justifies it by saying it's a curiosity and makes a comment about her weight being okay. He starts defending himself against her discomfort, calling her sensitive like other girls. Then she uses his known insecurity about his dick size to mirror his behavior by asking him about it. He gets embarrassed, she stops. Later, his friends call her a bitch for exploiting his insecurity, even though he wasn't aware of her sensitivity about her weight. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The guy asked a personal question about her weight after talking about fitness. She was uncomfortable, which is valid. Then he made a comment that implied she was heavier than him, which she took as implying she was fat. He didn't apologize and instead argued that it's a double standard. She then mirrored his behavior by asking about his dick size, which he found uncomfortable. His friends think she's at fault for using his insecurity.\n\nIs it okay to ask someone their weight? In many cultures, personal questions about weight, height, or body size are considered intrusive and can be hurtful. Especially when the person is already talking about fitness, which can be a sensitive topic. The guy's comment about her weighing more than him might have added to her discomfort. Her response was to mirror his behavior, which he found embarrassing. \n\nThe guy's friends argue that she knew his insecurity and used it, so she's the one being discriminatory. But the initial question from him was the start of the problem. He asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and then he didn't acknowledge her feelings, instead justifying his actions. When she tried to show him how his behavior affected her by using his own insecurity, he was upset. \n\nIt seems like the guy crossed a boundary first by asking about her weight in a context that made her feel judged. Her reaction was a way to make him understand how his questions made her feel. However, using his insecurity might not have been the best approach, but the main issue was his initial intrusion. \n\nThe friends are labeling her as the asshole because they think she used his vulnerability. But the root cause is his inappropriate question. She was trying to communicate her boundaries, which is her right. So, in this case, the author might not be in the wrong because she was responding to his initial transgression. However, maybe there's a nuance in how she handled it. \n\nBut the key here is that personal questions can be problematic, and the guy shouldn't have asked. The author had the right to set boundaries. Even if her method of doing so was confrontational, the fault lies more with the guy for initiating the conversation. So, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
