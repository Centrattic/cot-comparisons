Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. The author found that question uncomfortable, especially since weight can be a sensitive topic. The author answered but then felt the guy made a comment implying she was heavier than him, which made her feel he was being critical about her weight. She then asked him how big his dick is, which made him embarrassed. The guy didn't apologize, and her friends are now saying she's the asshole because she knew about his insecurity but used it against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was wrong to ask about his dick size. The guy brought up a sensitive topic (weight) and made a comment that made her feel judged. She responded by bringing up his known insecurity. Is that justified? Well, she was trying to show him his own behavior, but maybe it's not fair to retaliate in that way. \n\nBut also, the guy's initial question about her weight was the catalyst. Is it acceptable for him to ask that? Weight is a personal topic, and even if it's a direct question, it can be hurtful. The author felt uncomfortable and addressed it, which is reasonable. \n\nThe friends are calling her an asshole because she knew he was insecure about his size and used that. However, the guy didn't apologize for his behavior, so maybe the author was trying to mirror his actions to show hypocrisy. But using personal insecurities as a retort might not be the best approach, even if it's in response to something hurtful. \n\nIs the author at fault? Maybe not entirely. The guy's actions were inappropriate, but her response might have been a bit of an overreaction, especially since she knew it would make him uncomfortable. However, she was trying to make a point. The friends' reactions might be because they found her retaliation harsher than his original comments. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, generally, responding to someone else's inappropriate question with a personal question might not be the best way to handle it. The author could have addressed the discomfort without retaliating. So, maybe the author is partially at fault, but the guy was definitely in the wrong for making the comment about her weight. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friends are calling her the asshole, but maybe they're not considering the context of the guy's behavior. \n\nI think the key points are that the guy's initial question was inappropriate, the author's response might have been a form of self-defense, but using his insecurity might have been crossing a line. However, considering the context, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the guy initiated the uncomfortable conversation, and the author was trying to point out the double standard. However, some might argue that her response was also unkind. But in the AITA framework, the person who started the uncomfortable topic is usually the one at fault. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
