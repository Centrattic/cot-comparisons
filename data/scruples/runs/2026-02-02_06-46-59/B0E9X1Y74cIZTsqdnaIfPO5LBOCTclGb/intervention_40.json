Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, so she asked about his dick size to make him feel the same discomfort. The friends then criticized her for being an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The guy asked her weight after a date, which can be a sensitive topic. She felt it was a personal question, and his response about her weight wasn't comforting. Then she retaliated by asking about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. \n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The guy's question was intrusive, and his follow-up comment made her feel judged. She tried to get him to understand her feelings by mirroring his behavior. However, using someone's insecurity against them, even if it's about a sensitive topic, might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nOn one hand, she had the right to feel uncomfortable and set boundaries. On the other hand, her response of asking about his dick size might be seen as crossing a line herself. The friends' reaction points out that she knew his insecurity, so using that could be considered taking advantage. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If someone asks a personal question that makes you uncomfortable, responding in kind isn't necessarily wrong. However, the appropriateness of the response can be debated. The guy's initial question was rude, and her reaction was a form of self-defense. Still, maybe there's a more respectful way to address it without reciprocating with another potentially offensive question.\n\nThe user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to consider if her action was justified. If she was trying to make a point about mutual respect, it's a valid attempt. However, the friends are right that she knew his insecurity and used it to \"punish\" him. But the guy's behavior started the issue. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the judgment often lies on who acted inconsiderately. The guy's question was inappropriate and made her feel judged. She responded with another question that he found uncomfortable. While both are sensitive topics, the guy initiated the problematic behavior. However, her retaliation might have been unwise but not necessarily the asshole move. \n\nSo, the answer could be B, she's not in the wrong. Because the guy's actions were the initial problem, and she was trying to make him realize how his question affected her. Even if her method was a bit harsh, the root issue is his inappropriate questioning. The friends' perspective overlooks their own friend's rude behavior and focuses on her response, which might be the real problem.\n"
