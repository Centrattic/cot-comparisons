Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a guy asked how much the author weighs after they were on a date, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size in response, leading to some backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Asking someone about their weight can be a sensitive topic, especially in a dating context. The guy's approach might have been inappropriate because weight can be a personal subject. The author felt uncomfortable and responded by asking about his insecurities regarding his penis size, which is also a personal topic. \n\nNow, the key points to analyze: Was the guy's question about her weight a problem? Yes, because it's often seen as intrusive. However, when the author responded by asking about his size, that's also crossing a boundary. Even if it was a form of showing empathy or making him understand her perspective, the act of bringing up someone's insecurities can be seen as using their vulnerability against them. \n\nThe friends' reactions are important here. They felt she took advantage of his known insecurity to make a point. That suggests that the social circle values mutual respect and not exploiting personal vulnerabilities. The author's intention was to highlight the double standard, but the method might have been inappropriate. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong. However, the question is whether her action of asking about his size was justified. It's a form of retaliation, which can be seen as not the best approach. People often react poorly to being called out in such a direct and personal way. \n\nIn summary, while both parties had their own issues (he asked about weight, she asked about size), the author's response might have been a direct but unfair retaliation. The friends' judgment of her as the \"asshole\" could be influenced by the idea that she used his insecurity to make a point. However, the initial question about weight was also problematic. \n\nBut the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of asking about his size in response to his question and his comments could be seen as crossing the line, especially since it's a known insecurity. So, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, since the friends didn't apologize and the author's response was a form of personal attack, she might be considered at fault for using his vulnerability to make her point. So, AITA? Probably A, she is in the wrong.\n"
