Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) after a specific interaction. \n\nFirst, the situation: the guy asked the author how much she weighs during a date. The author felt uncomfortable and later confronted him when he made a comment about her weight. She then asked him about his dick size as a way to mirror his insecurity. The guy didn't apologize, and their friends are saying she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she felt was intrusive and made her uncomfortable. He then made a comparison that she perceived as implying she was fat. When she confronted him, he defended his behavior and brought up double standards. She used his known insecurity about his dick size to highlight the issue, which embarrassed him, and their friends are upset with her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\n1. **Asking about weight**: Weight is a sensitive topic. The guy asked it in a context that made her uncomfortable. While it's a factual question, it's often considered personal. Whether it's appropriate can depend on the context, but given that it led to her feeling judged, his approach might have been tactless.\n\n2. **His response**: He said she's an \"ok weight\" but his phrasing made her feel bad. His justification about double standards and criticizing her for being too sensitive might be problematic. Comparing weight (which can be managed) to height or other factors is a stretch, as weight is a health factor and can be influenced by many things beyond personal control.\n\n3. **Her response**: She asked about his dick size as a way to show him his own insecurity. This is a form of mirroring his behavior. While it's a direct retort, it's a reaction to his personal question. The friends criticized her for using his insecurity against him, but she was pointing out the inconsistency in how such topics are treated.\n\n4. **Friends' judgment**: Their friends labeled her as the asshole, possibly because they see her as taking advantage of his insecurity. But their argument hinges on the idea that she knew his insecurity and used it, which might be a valid point. However, her intent was to make him understand her perspective, which could be justified as a form of communication.\n\nSo, the guy initiated the personal question, made her uncomfortable, and then dismissed her feelings. The author's response was a direct challenge to his behavior, which might be seen as fair in the context of trying to communicate her discomfort. However, using his insecurity in that way could be seen as using his vulnerability against him, which might not be the best approach, even if her intent was to highlight the issue.\n\nBut the main issue is whether she's in the wrong. The guy asked a personal question, made a judgmental comment, and then criticized her for being sensitive. The author's response was a way to show him the impact of his words. While his actions were the catalyst, her response might have been an appropriate way to assert her boundaries, even if it was confrontational.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The guy's behavior started the issue by asking a sensitive question and making her feel judged. Her response was a way to communicate her discomfort, which is valid. However, using his insecurity in that way might not be the most constructive, but it's not necessarily her fault for trying to make him see her perspective.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
