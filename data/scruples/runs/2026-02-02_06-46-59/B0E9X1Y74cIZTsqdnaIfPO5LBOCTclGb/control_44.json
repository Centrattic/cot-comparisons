Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy asking the author how much she weighs, which makes her uncomfortable. She then asks him about his dick size in response. His friends are calling her an overreacting bitch for that. \n\nFirst, consider the initial question about weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and it's not uncommon for it to be used in a way that makes people feel judged. The guy's comment that she weighs more than him and his subsequent remark about her not being morbidly fat could be seen as dismissive or even slightly insulting. The author felt his question was personal and uncomfortable, which is valid because people have different comfort levels with sharing certain information.\n\nThen she asked about his dick size. His friends argue that she took advantage of his insecurity. But the author's action was in response to his comment. She's using his own insecurity against him to show him how his question made her feel. It's a form of mirroring his behavior, which might be a way to highlight the double standard he mentioned. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, so maybe he didn't take her point. However, the author's action could be seen as crossing a line because asking about someone's genital size is also a private and sensitive question. But the key here is the context. She was trying to make him understand her discomfort by putting him in a similar situation. \n\nThe friends' reaction is important too. They're saying she overreacted because she knew about his insecurity. But the author's reaction was to his inappropriate question and comments. It's about mutual respect and boundaries. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable by asking a personal question, it's reasonable to set a boundary, even if it means asking them something equally personal in return. \n\nOn the other hand, using his insecurity might not be the best approach. There's a difference between setting a boundary and retaliating. However, given the guy's defensiveness and lack of apology, the author's action could be a justified response to his insensitivity. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's often a double standard around body-related questions. Men asking about women's weight and women not wanting to be asked about men's size. The author's action might be a way to point out that hypocrisy. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's a nuanced situation. The author had the right to feel uncomfortable and to respond in a way that made the guy aware of his insensitivity. While asking about his size might be a personal question, it's framed in the context of his prior comment. Therefore, she's not in the wrong because she was defending her boundaries and pointing out the double standard.\n"
