Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asks about his dick size as a way to show him how his question made her feel. The guy didn't apologize, and others in their friend group called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, let me look at the guy's actions. He asked her weight, which is a sensitive topic for her. She said she felt uncomfortable and that his comment \"you weigh more than me\" sounded like an insult. Then he justified the question by saying girls are discriminatory about height, which is out of control, so guys can be about weight. That's a flawed argument because comparing two different things. His response was dismissive, saying she's not morbidly fat, which is still a backhanded compliment and not addressing her discomfort.\n\nThe author then asks about his dick size as a way to mirror his behavior. The friends think she's in the wrong because she knew about his insecurity and used it against him. But is it fair to compare weight and dick size? Weight is a sensitive topic for many, especially women, due to societal pressures. The guy's comment about double standards doesn't hold up because they're different issues\u2014height is genetic, while weight can be influenced by lifestyle, but that's a simplistic view. The author's action might come off as confrontational, but it's also a way to highlight the issue of personal questions and the hurt they cause.\n\nThe key points are: the guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, dismissed her feelings, and made a backhanded comment. She responded by asking a similarly personal question to show her perspective. The friends' judgment is based on the idea that she used his insecurity, but the root issue is the guy's initial behavior. The author's action was a reaction to being made to feel judged, so while her method might be questionable, the core issue is the guy's inappropriate question and response.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? I think not. The guy's actions were the initial problem, and her response, while maybe not the best approach, was an attempt to make him see how his words affected her. The friends' side is biased because they don't consider the dynamics of the conversation. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
