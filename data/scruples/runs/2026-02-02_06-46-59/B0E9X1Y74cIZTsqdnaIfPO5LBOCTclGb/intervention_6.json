Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size to mirror his insecurity. Her friends are calling her the asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though he didn't know about her weight sensitivity.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. He made a comment that she felt was dismissive and harsh. She responded by asking a similarly personal question about his body, which made him embarrassed. Her friends argue that she overstepped by using his insecurity, even if he had previously used hers.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break down both sides. On one hand, the guy initiated a personal question that made her uncomfortable. He didn't apologize and instead gave a defensive, possibly rude response. She was trying to show him how his actions made her feel by reciprocating with a question he's insecure about. That could be seen as an attempt to teach him a lesson, but maybe it's not the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, responding to a hurtful question with another personal question might escalate the situation. Even if her intention was to highlight the double standard, her method might have been seen as taking advantage of his vulnerability. The friends' perspective is that she used his known insecurity against him, which they consider unfair, especially since he wasn't aware of her sensitivity about her weight.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone about their weight can be intrusive and rude. The guy's approach was inappropriate. However, the author's response of asking about his dick size, while perhaps intended to show the double standard, might come across as using his insecurity to retaliate. This could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if her initial discomfort was valid.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to confront him in that way. She was trying to communicate her feelings, but using a personal question might have been an aggressive tactic. It's possible that a more direct discussion about how his comments made her feel would have been better. Instead, by mirroring his behavior, she might have validated the kind of interaction she was trying to criticize.\n\nThe friends' reaction that she's the asshole might stem from the idea that she weaponized his insecurity, which they consider unfair since he didn't know about hers. However, they might not understand the intention behind her question. But using someone's insecurity in a confrontational way, even if it's to make a point, can be seen as manipulative.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit murky. The initial question from the guy was definitely wrong, but her response might be seen as equally problematic. The key is whether her action was a proportionate response or an overreaction. Since she was trying to make a point about double standards, maybe her approach was justified in her mind, but others might see it as taking it too far.\n\nConsidering all this, the friends' perspective is that she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him. However, her intention was to highlight the issue with his behavior. But in terms of social norms, maybe her response was not the best way to handle it, leading her to be in the wrong (A). Alternatively, if his initial question was the problem, maybe she's not in the wrong (B). But given that her response was to mirror the personal question and cause him embarrassment, which is similar to his behavior, she might be in the wrong for using the same tactic.\n"
