Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Ask the Internets post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then retaliated by asking about his penis size, and now there's a debate about who's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her weight, which she found intrusive and uncomfortable. He followed up by commenting on her weight compared to his, which she interpreted as an insult. She then asked for the point of his question, and when he didn't apologize, she asked about his penis size to make him feel the same discomfort. \n\nOn one hand, asking about someone's weight can be a sensitive and personal question, especially for women. It's often seen as a body-shaming question. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" and comparing it to his might have been unintentionally hurtful, but he didn't apologize. The author's response was to use his own insecurity to mirror his behavior, which could be seen as using his vulnerability against him. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy initiated the conversation by asking a personal question. The author's retaliation might be seen as a way to express her discomfort and show him how his actions affected her. However, asking about someone's penis size is also a personal and potentially sensitive topic. While the intention was to get him to understand her perspective, it might have been a direct and confrontational approach that could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe friends' reactions are also important. They labeled her as the \"asshole\" because they believed she used his insecurity against him, even though she was responding to his initial intrusive question. This suggests there's a societal double standard where men's comments about weight are more accepted, and women's similar comments about genital size are seen as more offensive. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were a form of self-defense in the conversation, trying to highlight the hurtfulness of his question. However, using his insecurity as a weapon might not be the most constructive way to address the issue. The key point is whether her response was proportionate and respectful. While the initial question was problematic, her retaliation could be seen as equally problematic because it's a different type of sensitive topic. \n\nBut in terms of who started it, the guy did initiate the conversation with a personal question. The author's response was to mirror his behavior, which might be a way to illustrate the issue. However, the friends' judgment is that she overstepped, which complicates the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because she was responding to a personal and hurtful question, but her method of response could be seen as equally inappropriate. However, since the guy initiated the intrusive conversation, the author's actions might be justified as a way to express her discomfort and seek understanding, even if it was a confrontational approach. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
