Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, and she later asked about his dick size in response. The friends think she's the asshole, but she's conflicted.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight, which is a sensitive topic for many. Even if he thought it was casual, the author felt uncomfortable. She tried to handle it by answering, but then he made a comment that she interpreted as critical. That's when she pushed back by asking about his dick size. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? The guy's question was invasive, and his follow-up comments were harsh. The author had every right to feel uncomfortable and to set boundaries. By asking a reciprocal personal question, she's using his own behavior as a mirror. It's a form of holding him accountable for making her feel judged. \n\nHowever, the friends argue that she knew about his insecurity and used that to attack him. But the author's intention was to show him the perspective he wasn't considering. The friends labeling her as an asshole seems to be defending the guy's behavior, which might not be valid. They\u2019re saying he didn\u2019t know about her insecurities, but he did make her feel judged. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, which is a problem. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself and addressing the discomfort caused by his questions. The fact that she didn't overreact but instead tried to explain her feelings shows she's not being unreasonable. The friends' reactions are likely biased because they support the guy. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. She had the right to set boundaries after being made uncomfortable by his questions and comments.\n"
