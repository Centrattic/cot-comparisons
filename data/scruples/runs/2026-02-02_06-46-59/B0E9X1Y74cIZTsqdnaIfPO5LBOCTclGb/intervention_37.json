Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable, so she asked him about his dick size in response. Then, when he didn't respond, her friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. She answered but then felt insulted by his comment about her weight. She asked him about his dick size to show him the discomfort he caused. He got embarrassed, and her friends said she was in the wrong for using his insecurity.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respect in personal boundaries. Asking someone's weight can be seen as invasive. The author's response was to mirror the personal question with another sensitive topic. While the guy may have made a comment she found hurtful, retaliating with a question about his body might not be the best approach. However, she was within her rights to express her discomfort. \n\nHer friends' judgment is another angle. They think she used his insecurity, which complicates things. But did she cross a line? If she asked in response to his comment, it's a form of pointing out the hypocrisy, but it's possible she escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both topics are sensitive. The guy's initial question was inappropriate, and the author's response, while direct, might be seen as taking it too far. However, she did try to explain her perspective, and he didn't apologize. The friends' reactions might stem from their own biases.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Maybe partially. She could have handled it differently instead of retaliating with another personal question. But the initial question from the guy was also inappropriate. The answer might hinge on whether using his insecurity was justified. Since she used his vulnerability to make a point, some might see that as exploiting his insecurity, hence her being in the wrong. But others might argue she was just showing him how his actions affected her. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because she used his insecurity as a tool in the conversation, which her friends pointed out. Even if her intention was to highlight the double standard, the method might be seen as manipulative or taking advantage of his vulnerability. So, while both sides have issues, the author's action of asking about his dick size in response could be considered crossing a line.\n"
