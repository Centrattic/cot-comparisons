Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight after a date, which made the author uncomfortable. The author then asks the guy about his dick size to show him how it feels. The friends are saying the author is the asshole because they knew the guy was insecure about his penis size and used that against him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Asking about someone's weight is often seen as a personal or sensitive question, and it can be offensive. The guy's comment that \"you weigh more than me\" and his subsequent remarks about double standards might have been hurtful. The author felt they were being judged about their weight, which is a valid concern since body image is a sensitive topic for many.\n\nThen, the author responded by asking about the guy's penis size. That's a personal question too. Even though the author was trying to show him how they felt, it's a direct and invasive question. The guy got embarrassed and asked them to stop. The friends criticized the author for taking advantage of his insecurity. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the initial question from the guy was inappropriate, and the author had the right to feel uncomfortable. However, the author's response of asking about his penis size might be seen as equally inappropriate. While it was a reaction to the guy's behavior, it's not necessarily a justified response. People might argue that using someone else's insecurity against them isn't the right approach, even if the original action was wrong. \n\nThe key points are: the guy asked a personal question, made a hurtful comment, and the author retaliated with another personal question. The friends' reaction is based on the idea that the author knew about his insecurity and used it. The author might have had the right to express discomfort, but their method of doing so might be seen as equally inappropriate. So, maybe the author is partially in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer is A for yes or B for no, the friends think the author is the asshole. The story ends with the author feeling justified but the friends disagree. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the guy asked something personal, asking about his penis size is also a personal and inappropriate question. The author used his insecurity against him, which might be seen as taking advantage. So, the author's action could be considered in the wrong.\n"
