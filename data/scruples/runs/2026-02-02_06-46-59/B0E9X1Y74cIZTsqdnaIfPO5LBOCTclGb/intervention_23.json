Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation starts with a guy asking the author how much she weighs. The author felt uncomfortable and then later asked him about his penis size, which led to some backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the conversation. The guy asked about her weight, which can be a sensitive topic. The author felt it was personal and maybe even offensive when he added a comment about her weight compared to his. Then she asked about his penis size as a way to show him her perspective. \n\nI think the key points here are about consent and mutual respect. The guy's question about her weight was intrusive, and she had the right to feel uncomfortable. However, when she asked about his penis size, it might have been a form of tit-for-tat, but it's also a very personal and potentially embarrassing question. Even if her intention was to make him understand her feelings, it's possible that her method was not the best approach. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, but the author's friends are calling her an asshole because she used his insecurity against him. There's a double standard here, as the guy's question was about her body, which is a common source of insecurity for women, whereas his insecurity is about a different body part. But the author's response might have been seen as unfair because she took advantage of his known insecurity. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both parties have some issues. The guy shouldn't have asked about her weight without considering her feelings, and the author's response, while an attempt to communicate her hurt, might have crossed a line. However, the main wrongdoer is the guy for making her uncomfortable first. That said, the author's friends might be perpetuating the problem by not supporting her. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the guy was the initial aggressor, then she had a right to respond, even if her method was questionable. However, asking about his penis size is a very personal question, even if it's in response to his comment. So maybe she overstepped. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a toss-up. The guy's actions were clearly problematic, but the author's reaction might have been a proportional response in her mind. However, using his insecurity against him could be seen as unfair, even if she had a right to be upset. So, maybe she's partly at fault. But the main issue is the guy's behavior. The friends are wrong for calling her an asshole, but the question is about the author's actions. \n\nHmm. I think the key is whether her response was justified. Since the guy's question was intrusive and she felt uncomfortable, she had the right to set boundaries. However, using his own insecurity as a counter might have been a poor choice, especially if it was meant to make him uncomfortable. So maybe the answer is A, she's in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a situation where both are at fault, but the question is only about the author. \n\nWait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the situation. The guy asked a personal question, which was rude. She responded by asking a personal question in return. Both are personal and potentially hurtful. However, societal norms might view the guy's question as more acceptable (though it's not), but the author's question might be seen as worse because it's more taboo. So, the author might be in the wrong because she escalated things by asking about his penis size, even if it was as a reaction. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
