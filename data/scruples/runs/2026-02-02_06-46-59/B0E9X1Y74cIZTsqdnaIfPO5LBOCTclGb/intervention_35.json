Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is that a guy asked how much she weighs after she mentioned not being able to deadlift like the woman in the post. Then he made a comment about her weighing more than him, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. Her friends think she's the asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Asking someone's weight can be a sensitive topic, especially for women. The guy's approach was pretty forward, and his comment about her weighing more than him might have come across as judgmental. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to make him see her side by asking about his insecurity. \n\nBut then, when she asked about his dick size, that's a personal question too. It's not just about the content of the conversation but also the context. The guy was already sensitive about that, so her question could be seen as crossing the line. However, she did it to illustrate the double standard he was pointing out. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, and others are criticizing her for being overreactive. The key points are mutual discomfort and the reaction from friends. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but maybe it's a matter of perspective. The guy asked a personal question and made a possibly offensive comment, so her response could be justified as pointing out the hypocrisy. However, bringing up his dick size is also a personal topic, so maybe she overstepped. \n\nI need to balance both sides. The initial question was invasive, and his response was rude. She used his insecurity to mirror his behavior, which might be seen as fair, but the topic of dick size is more private. The friends' reactions are based on the idea that she knew his insecurity and used it against him. \n\nSo, the question is whether her response was a justified reaction to his behavior. If he was making a point about double standards, she highlighted that by reciprocating with his own sensitive topic. But maybe the way she did it was too direct. Alternatively, she might have been right to set boundaries and show the imbalance in what's considered acceptable to ask. \n\nI'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong because she was responding to his judgmental comment and trying to make a point about double standards. However, some might argue that asking about his body size, even if it's a sensitive topic, was an overreaction. But given the context of his comments and the friend group's reaction, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how personal certain topics are considered. In some contexts, weight is more of a taboo to ask about, while penile size isn't. But she was pointing out that hypocrisy, which might make her not in the wrong. However, the act of asking such a question directly after he asked about her weight could be seen as taking it too far, even if it's to make a point. So maybe she is in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit conflicted. The guy's behavior was inappropriate, and her response was a form of protest against that. But the method she used was equally invasive. The friends are on his side, which might indicate that in their culture, such questions are not acceptable. So the answer might be A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the guy's comment was the real issue, and her response was a valid reaction, then B. I think it's a classic AITA scenario where both sides have some validity, but the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The user's initial thought is A, but I need to decide based on the situation. The key is whether her actions were a reasonable response to his. Since she was trying to mirror his behavior to show the double standard, but using a topic that's even more private,"
