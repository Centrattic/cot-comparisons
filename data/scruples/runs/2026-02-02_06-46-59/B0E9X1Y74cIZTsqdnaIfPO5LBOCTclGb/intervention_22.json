Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy asking the author how much they weigh, which made the author uncomfortable. The author then retaliates by asking about the guy's penis size, leading to conflict and judgment from his friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and boundaries. When someone asks a personal question that makes you uncomfortable, responding in the same way might not be the best approach. The guy's question about weight was intrusive, but the author's response about his penis size could be seen as equally personal and retaliatory. \n\nThe guy's comment about weight being a \"double standard\" and his insecurity about his own body might explain his behavior, but that doesn't justify making others uncomfortable. However, the author's response was a direct retaliation, which might have been intended to show him how it feels but could also be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe friends' reactions are also important. They think the author is at fault because they knew about the guy's insecurity and used it against him. While the guy's initial question was inappropriate, the author's method of pointing that out by asking a similarly personal question might not be the best way to address it. It's possible that the author could have handled it more gracefully without escalating the situation with a personal question.\n\nIn many cases, using someone's insecurity against them isn't considered a mature or constructive response. The author's intention was to make the guy understand their perspective, but the method might have been flawed. The key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable and respectful way to address the discomfort. Since the author's action was a direct personal question in return, it's a tit-for-tat approach that might not be socially acceptable, even if the initial question was problematic.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they responded in kind rather than addressing the issue through a more constructive conversation. The friends' judgment that the author was the \"overreacting bitch\" could stem from the idea that they took advantage of the man's insecurity, even if it was to make a point. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
