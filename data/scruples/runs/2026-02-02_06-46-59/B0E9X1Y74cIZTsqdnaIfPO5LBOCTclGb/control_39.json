Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, leading her to ask about his dick size in return. The guy then didn't apologize, and her friends called her a bitch for using his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. She answered but then felt he was making a judgment when he said she weighed more than him. She confronted him, and he didn't take it well, bringing up double standards. Then she asked about his dick size to show him her perspective, which he found embarrassing. His friends criticized her for using his insecurity.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, asking about weight can be sensitive, and she had the right to feel uncomfortable. His response of saying she's an \"ok weight\" might have been dismissive. Her reaction of asking about his dick size could be seen as using his insecurity to make a point, which his friends criticized. But on the other hand, he initially asked a personal question, which could be seen as intrusive, and she was responding in kind to show the discomfort he caused.\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment based on the scenario. The author's actions might be seen as self-defense in pointing out the double standard, but some might argue she crossed a line by bringing up his insecurity. However, the initial question from the guy was the catalyst. The key here is whether her response was a justified reaction to his personal question and dismissive attitude.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The guy started by asking a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and his subsequent comments were hurtful. Her response was an attempt to show him the unfairness of his actions, using his own insecurities as a mirror. While the method might be a bit confrontational, the root issue is the initial invasion of privacy. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
