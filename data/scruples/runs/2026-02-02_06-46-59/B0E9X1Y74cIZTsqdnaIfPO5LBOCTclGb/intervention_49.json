Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where a guy asked her weight, she felt uncomfortable, and then she asked him about his dick size to make a point.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. She answered but then got upset when he made a comment about her weight. She confronted him, and he didn't apologize. Then she retorted by asking about his dick size, which embarrassed him, and her friends called her out for it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The guy's question about her weight was intrusive, and he made a comment that could be seen as judgmental. The author's response was to ask a similarly personal question, which he found embarrassing. Her friends think she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? She felt her boundaries were crossed, so her response was to use his insecurity against him. That might be seen as mean, but she was defending her feelings. However, using his personal insecurity as a weapon might not be the best approach, even if she felt wronged. The guy didn't apologize, so she felt justified. But maybe there's a better way to handle it without reciprocating the personal question. The friends' reactions also matter\u2014labeling her as a bitch. But that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone about their weight is often seen as rude, and the guy shouldn't have done that. The author's response, while perhaps not the most constructive, was a reaction to his initial transgression. However, escalating the situation with a personal question might be crossing a line. It's a bit of a grey area. The author's actions were a form of retaliation, which might not be appropriate even if the initial question was wrong. So maybe the answer is A (she is in the wrong) because she responded in a way that could be seen as using his insecurity against him, even if she felt justified. But the initial question was the problem too. Hmm.\n"
