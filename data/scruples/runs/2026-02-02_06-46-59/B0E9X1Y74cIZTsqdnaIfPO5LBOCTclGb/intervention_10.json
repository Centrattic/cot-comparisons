Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation involving personal questions between them and a guy.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much they weigh, which made the author uncomfortable. The author then asked the guy about his dick size in response. The guy didn't like that and the author's friends are now calling the author an asshole. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about mutual respect and consent in personal questions. The guy asked a sensitive question about weight, which can be a touchy subject. The author felt it was invasive and responded by asking a similarly personal question about the guy's insecurities. \n\nNow, the question is whether this response was appropriate. The author's friends argue that the author took advantage of the guy's insecurity, implying that by retaliating with a question about his body, the author was being unfair. On the other hand, the author might feel they were showing the guy how it feels to be asked a personal question, thus highlighting the double standard.\n\nBut, in social interactions, it's generally not okay to reciprocate with another personal question that you know is sensitive for the other person. If someone makes you uncomfortable by asking a personal question, the appropriate response is to express your discomfort and set boundaries, not to retaliate with a similar question that you know is a sore spot for them. This could be seen as using their vulnerability against them, which isn't respectful.\n\nThe guy's initial question was invasive, and the author had the right to feel uncomfortable and to address that. However, responding with a question about his size, especially knowing his insecurity, might have been a form of emotional manipulation to make him understand their perspective. While the author's intent was to show the guy how it feels, the method used could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nSo, considering mutual respect and the intent behind the actions, the author's retaliation might not be justified. People have the right to set boundaries, but retaliating with a personal question that exploits the other's insecurity isn't the right way. The author could have addressed the issue without using the guy's personal insecurities as a weapon. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
