Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then responded by asking him about his dick size to make him feel the same discomfort he caused her. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she knew he was insecure about that and used it against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Asking someone's weight is generally seen as a personal or sensitive question, even if the person asks first. It's a topic that many people find uncomfortable because it's linked to body image issues. The guy asked her weight, which she felt was intrusive. Then, when she asked back about his dick size, he got embarrassed. The friends are arguing that she took advantage of his insecurity, knowing he's self-conscious about that. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt wronged by the initial question and tried to show him how his actions made her feel by reciprocating with a personal question. She didn't apologize, but she did stop when he asked. The question is whether her retaliation was justified. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, if someone makes you uncomfortable by asking a personal question, responding in kind might not be the best approach. It can escalate the situation and lead to accusations of being inconsiderate. The friends' reaction suggests that they see her as the aggressor because she used his known insecurity against him. However, the author's intention was to highlight the double standard she perceived in how personal questions are treated based on gender. \n\nBut does that justify her actions? Even if her intention was to make a point, using personal questions to retaliate can be seen as crossing a line. The key here is whether her response was appropriate. By asking about his dick size, she's using the same type of personal question that made her uncomfortable, even though the context and societal norms around weight and body size differ. \n\nThe guy's comments about double standards and his own insecurity might have been hurtful, but the author's response could be seen as taking the conversation into a different realm. Weight and sexual anatomy are both sensitive topics, but the way they're socially discussed can vary. The fact that she knew his insecurity and used it might have made her actions seem more like an attack rather than a constructive response. \n\nAdditionally, the friends' judgment of her as the asshole because she used his insecurity against him suggests that in their social circle, her response was considered unfair. However, that doesn't automatically make her right or wrong. It's about whether her actions were a reasonable defense of her boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between standing up for oneself and overstepping. The author felt she was being treated unfairly by the personal question, so she responded with a similar question to show the hurt. But retaliating in that way might not be the most effective or socially acceptable method. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because her response could be seen as using his insecurity in a way that wasn't respectful, even if her intention was to highlight hypocrisy. Alternatively, she could be justified in asserting her boundaries. However, given the context and the friends' reactions, it's more likely that the author overreacted, making her the asshole. So, the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
