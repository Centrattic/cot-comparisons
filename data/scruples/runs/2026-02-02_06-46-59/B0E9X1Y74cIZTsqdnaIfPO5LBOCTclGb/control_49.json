Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size in response. The friends are calling her the asshole for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around personal questions. Weight can be a sensitive topic, especially for women. The guy's question might have crossed a line, making her uncomfortable. His response about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat could come off as dismissive or even offensive. \n\nThen, when she responded by asking about his dick size, he got embarrassed and didn't apologize. His friends are criticizing her for using his insecurity. But the key here is whether her response was justified. She felt he was being discriminatory by asking about her weight, so she tried to mirror his behavior to show him how it feels. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, there's often a double standard regarding body-related questions. Men might ask about weight more freely, while asking about a man's genital size is typically considered more taboo. However, the context matters. She was reacting to his comment, which she found hurtful. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, and his friends are blaming her. But the initial issue was his question about her weight and the subsequent comments. Her response was an attempt to make him see her perspective by putting him in a similar uncomfortable situation. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone makes you feel uncomfortable by asking personal questions, responding in kind to show the impact can be a valid form of communication. However, it's also possible that using a sensitive topic like his dick size might be seen as taking advantage of his insecurity. But considering his initial comments about double standards and the way he framed his question, her response could be seen as a justified reaction to highlight the inconsistency.\n\nThe friends' reactions might stem from societal norms that women shouldn't be so sensitive or that men can't be too sensitive about their bodies. But the problem isn't just her sensitivity; it's the guy's insensitivity in asking personal questions without considering how it affects her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were a response to being made uncomfortable by the guy's comments. She tried to communicate her feelings by mirroring his behavior, which the guy found uncomfortable. The friends' judgment might be influenced by traditional gender roles. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because she was standing up for herself against an inappropriate question.\n"
