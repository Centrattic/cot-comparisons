Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy asked the woman how much she weighs during a date, which made her uncomfortable. He then made a comment about her weight compared to his, which she found offensive. She responded by asking about his penis size, which embarrassed him. Now, his friends are calling her a bitch for using his insecurity against him.\n\nThe main question is whether the woman is in the wrong for asking about his penis size in response to his comments about her weight. \n\nLooking at the dynamics: The guy initiated the personal question about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. When she confronted him about it, he made a dismissive comment about her sensitivity and brought up a double standard about discrimination. The woman, knowing his insecurity about his size, used that to mirror his behavior. \n\nFrom a social perspective, asking about someone's body can be seen as prying, especially if it's in response to a similar question that made you uncomfortable. However, the guy first asked about her weight, which is a private matter and can be hurtful. By asking about his penis size, she's using his own behavior against him, highlighting the double standard he mentioned. \n\nBut is this fair? Some might argue that while the guy's initial question was inappropriate, her response was also crossing a line. Others might see it as a justified response to his insensitivity. The key here is whether her action was an appropriate way to address his behavior. \n\nThe friends' reaction is also a point. They see her as the asshole because she used his insecurity to point out his wrong. But if the guy was already creating a hostile environment by making hurtful comments, her response could be a way to assert her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally not acceptable to ask someone about their body size unless it's mutually agreed upon. However, in this context, she's trying to show him the same treatment he gave her. It's a form of tit-for-tat, which can be seen as fair in some contexts but might be considered escalating the conflict. \n\nConsidering all this, the woman's action was a direct response to his behavior, attempting to make him see the inappropriateness. While both sides have crossed lines, the initial issue was his inappropriate question about her weight. Her response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was pointing out the double standard. Therefore, she might not be the asshole here. But some might argue that she overreacted. However, given the context of his comments and the friend group's support for him, her action could be seen as standing up for herself. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
