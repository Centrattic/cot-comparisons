Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that this guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking him about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. The friends then called her an asshole for taking advantage of his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around personal questions. Typically, asking someone's weight can be a sensitive topic, as the author mentioned. People often have insecurities about their weight, and it's generally seen as a personal question. So when the guy asked her that, it was probably inconsiderate, but that's his action. Then, when she asked him about his dick size, which is also a personal question, especially about his body image. But he was already known to be insecure about that. \n\nNow, the author's action was a direct response to his question, using his own insecurity to make a point. The friends argue that she knew about his insecurity and used it against him, which is why she's the asshole. But the author's intention was to show him her perspective on his behavior. So, was her reaction fair? \n\nIn terms of fairness, if someone asks a personal question and the other person responds with another personal question that they know is sensitive, is that justified? It might be seen as a tit-for-tat approach. However, using someone's known insecurities to make a point could be considered crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the guy's response to her weight was dismissive and maybe even a bit rude. He said she wasn't morbidly fat, which could come off as harsh. The author felt justified in confronting him about his comment. But by asking about his dick size, she might have escalated the situation, leading to embarrassment. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author's response was a reasonable way to address the discomfort and if it's a double standard. The guy argued that there's a double standard in being able to comment on each other's insecurities. But weight and body size are different from other aspects. However, the author's method of confronting him might have been inappropriate, as it's not a fair comparison. \n\nThe friends' perspective is that she took advantage of his known insecurity. If she was aware he was insecure about that, then directly asking the question to make a point could be seen as using that to hurt him, which is inconsiderate. Even if her intention was to highlight the issue, the approach might be wrong. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: the guy's initial question was inconsiderate, but the author's response might have been equally inconsiderate and possibly more damaging. It's about mutual respect. Since she used his insecurity to teach a lesson, even if with good intent, it's probably not the right approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
