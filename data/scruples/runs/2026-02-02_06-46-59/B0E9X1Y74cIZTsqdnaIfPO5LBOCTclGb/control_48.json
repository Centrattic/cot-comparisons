Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking the guy about his dick size after he asked about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. Then he made a comment implying she was heavier than him, which she found offensive. She responded by asking about his dick size to show him the perspective of being judged on something personal. \n\nNow, weight is a sensitive topic for many people, and it's often considered a personal question. The guy's follow-up comment about her weight and his own could come off as judgmental. The author felt the need to point out the double standard by flipping the script. But was her response appropriate?\n\nThe guy was insecure about his body (dick size), and she used that to highlight the issue. However, bringing up such a personal question in return might be crossing a line, even if it's to make a point. It's a direct and potentially hurtful way to mirror the judgment she received.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy initiated the personal conversation by asking about her weight in a way that made her uncomfortable. The author's intent was to show him how his actions felt. But maybe she could have addressed the discomfort without reciprocating in the same way. \n\nAlso, the friends' reactions are important. They felt she was overreacting, but maybe they don't understand her feelings of being judged. The key here is whether the author's response was a fair way to handle the situation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally unkind to ask someone about their body size in a judgmental way. The author's question might be seen as a valid attempt to highlight hypocrisy, but using the same tactic could be seen as equally inappropriate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She had every right to feel uncomfortable and to stand up for herself, but using a personal question in return might not be the best approach. However, the initial question from the guy was problematic. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's response was justified. Since she was trying to make a point about the double standard, but used a method that could be seen as equally invasive, it's possible she overstepped. But the guy's initial comments were the root issue. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because she was responding to a personal and offensive question. However, the way she responded could be seen as escalating the situation. But in the context of self-defense, maybe she's not wrong. It's a tough call, but leaning towards B.\n"
