Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his penis size as a way to show him how his question made her feel. The guy didn't respond and became embarrassed. The author's friends think she's in the wrong because she used his insecurity against him, even though he had previously used her insecurity about weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around personal questions. Asking someone's weight is generally considered intrusive and can be sensitive, especially for women. The guy's question might have been thoughtless or inconsiderate. The author felt uncomfortable and confronted him about it, which is a reasonable reaction. However, when she asked about his penis size, that's a personal question too, similar to weight. The guy's friends are arguing that she used his known insecurity to retaliate, which they see as unfair.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. The guy crossed a boundary by asking about weight without considering her feelings. The author felt she had to respond in kind to make him understand the impact of his question. But asking about his penis size is another personal topic, even if it's his known insecurity. The friends argue that she took advantage of his vulnerability, which might be a valid point. However, the initial question about weight was the starting point, so she might be trying to illustrate the double standard.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent and mutual respect in conversations. If someone asks a personal question without consideration, it's reasonable to express discomfort. The author's method of responding might be seen as a form of \"fighting fire with fire,\" but it's debatable whether that's appropriate. The guy didn't apologize, so maybe he didn't fully acknowledge his mistake. The author's friends think she's being unfair, but the original question was the problem.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, there's often a double standard where men can ask about weight but not be criticized as much, while women asking about penis size are seen as aggressive. The author might be pointing out that hypocrisy. However, the friends are reacting negatively because she used his insecurity, which they perceive as exploiting. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's response was justified. She felt her boundaries were crossed, so she tried to make him see her perspective. But using a personal question in return could be seen as crossing a boundary as well. However, since the guy initiated the personal question, her response might be a form of self-advocacy. The friends' judgment might stem from a traditional view that women shouldn't be so sensitive about weight, while men can be about their size. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The guy's initial question was inappropriate, and the author had the right to express her discomfort. Her method of doing so might be debatable, but her intention was to highlight the issue. The friends' judgment that she's the asshole could be due to not seeing the initial problem with the weight question. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. She had a right to feel uncomfortable and respond in a way she thought would make him understand. However, using a similar personal question might not have been the best approach, but her main fault isn't there. The guy's friends are likely not understanding the context of the initial question. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
