Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries in conversations.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking a personal question about his insecurities (dick size), which he didn't appreciate. The friends are calling her an asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though he used hers.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The guy's question about weight was inappropriate and made her uncomfortable. By pointing out his insecurity, she's trying to mirror his behavior, which could be seen as self-defense to show the hypocrisy. However, using his personal insecurity might be crossing a line, even if it's to make a point.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy initiated the sensitive question, which set the dynamic. The author's response was a direct reaction to his comment about her weight. If she didn't know about his insecurity, maybe she wouldn't have used it. But since she did, using that knowledge could be seen as exploiting his vulnerability to make a point, which isn't fair. However, it's also about showing him the hurt he caused by using the same tactics.\n\nThe friends are criticizing her for overreacting, but the initial question was the problem. The author's response was a way to highlight the double standard he pointed out. It's a bit of a gray area. Legally and morally, both sides acted in ways that could be seen as crossing lines, but the context of the guy's initial inappropriate question is key. The author's action was a response to his behavior, so maybe she's not entirely wrong. But using his insecurity in that way might be where she made a mistake. Alternatively, it's a valid response to show him the hurt he caused. \n\nHmm. It's tricky. I think the author's intent was to make him understand her discomfort. However, using his personal insecurities might not be the best approach, even if it's to make a point. But given the context, maybe it's justified. The friends' reaction is also a red flag on his side. So, the answer would depend on whether using his insecurity was a fair response. If the guy was wrong for bringing up her weight, then her response is a form of self-advocacy. But if she overstepped, then she's part of the problem. \n\nI'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong because she was responding to an inappropriate question. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. Still, in the context of the conversation, her action was a direct consequence of his. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But the user thinks A. I need to consider both perspectives carefully.\n"
