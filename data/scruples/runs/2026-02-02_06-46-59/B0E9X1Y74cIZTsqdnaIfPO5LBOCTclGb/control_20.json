Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about two people on a date. The guy asked the woman how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking him about his dick size, which he was insecure about. Now, they're both upset and friends are taking sides.\n\nFirst, the guy asked about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and even though he might have thought it was a normal question, it's possible that bringing up his own weight afterwards (like \"you weigh more than me\") could come off as dismissive or even critical. The woman felt he was implying she was fat, which is a valid emotional response. She then asked why he needed to know, which makes sense because people often feel uncomfortable with personal questions, especially about their body.\n\nHe defended himself by saying it was just a question and made comments about double standards regarding height and weight. That part seems a bit problematic. Comparing height (which is generally accepted as something you can't change) to weight (which people can control, at least in part) isn't a fair comparison. Also, bringing up discrimination against guys about height to justify judging women's weights is a flawed argument. It's not an equal situation.\n\nThen the woman, knowing his insecurity about his penis size, asked him about it. This is where it gets tricky. She used his insecurity to make a point about how he treated her. Is that fair? Well, if she knew he was insecure, bringing up a personal question could be seen as using his vulnerability against him. However, she was trying to show him that the way he felt (being judged) was similar to how she felt when he asked about her weight. That's a bit of a teachable moment, but maybe she went too far by turning the question back on him in a public or semi-public setting, depending on how their friends reacted.\n\nThe guy didn't apologize, and his friends are calling her an overreacting bitch. They argue that she knew his insecurity and used it against him, which might be their justification. But the initial issue was his question about her weight, which led to a harsh comment from him. The woman had a right to feel uncomfortable and express that. Her response might have been a bit of a tit-for-tat, but it's possible she was trying to make him understand her perspective. However, using his insecurity directly in a confrontational way could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's done in a way that's public or embarrassing him.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the guy definitely had no right to make her feel bad about her weight, and his comments were hurtful. The woman's response was an attempt to make him understand her side, but maybe she could have handled it differently. Instead of using his insecurity as a tool for retaliation, perhaps a more direct conversation about boundaries would have been better. But overall, the main issue was the guy's inappropriate question and comment. The woman's response, while perhaps not the most tactful, was in reaction to his actions. So, the author (the woman) is not entirely in the wrong, but maybe she could have approached it differently. However, the guys in the friend group are probably not considering the emotional impact of his words. So, I think the answer is B, No.\n"
