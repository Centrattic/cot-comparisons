Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she retaliated by asking about his dick size. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and boundaries involved. The guy asked a personal question, which is generally seen as intrusive. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and it's not uncommon for people to feel uncomfortable sharing it. The author might have felt that the question was rude or inappropriate, especially if it was asked in a way that implied judgment.\n\nThen, when he made a comment about her weighing more than him, she felt it was a backhanded compliment. His follow-up about not being morbidly fat might have come off as dismissive or even offensive. The key point here is how his comments were perceived. If they made her feel unvalued or criticized, that's a valid reaction.\n\nBut when she asked about his dick size, that's another personal question. Although she used his own behavior as a mirror, the move might be seen as hypocritical. The friends in the group called her out for being an overreacting bitch, which suggests some people in their social circle don't see her action as justified. They argue that she knew his insecurity but used it to retaliate after he brought up her weight.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The guy crossed a boundary by asking her weight, and his comment about her being okay in weight but not his own might indicate a double standard. The author's retaliation, while perhaps understandable as a show of empathy, might not be the most appropriate response. She could have addressed his comments without reciprocating with a personal question about him. \n\nAlso, the guy didn't apologize, which might indicate he didn't see his part in the conflict. However, the author's action could be seen as taking the conversation in a direction that escalated the tension. The friends' reaction is based on the idea that she should have known better, given his known insecurities. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy initiated the personal topic with his question and the potentially harsh comment. The author felt her boundaries were violated and tried to make him understand by using his own insecurities. But using a personal question about his anatomy as a response might not be the best way to communicate her discomfort. It could be perceived as turning the tables on a sensitive issue, even if it's about something else. \n\nSo while the guy was in the wrong first, the author's response might not be entirely justified either. The friends' perspective is that she overreacted and used his vulnerability against him. The author's intention was to show him the other side, but the method could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the author might share some of the responsibility here, but it's not entirely her fault. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the fact that she retaliated with a similarly personal question could tip the scales in the friends' view. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. The guy's initial question was inappropriate, but her response might also be seen as taking it too far. So maybe the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong for retaliating in a way that's equally personal.\n"
