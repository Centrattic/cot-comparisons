Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their actions in the described situation.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and the author felt uncomfortable. The guy followed up by saying she weighs more than him, which made her feel targeted. She responded by questioning the point of the question, and he made some comments about her being okay for her height/age but not morbidly fat. That sounds pretty harsh and dismissive.\n\nThen she asked him how big his dick is, which made him embarrassed, and he asked her to stop. The guy's friends later called her an overreacting bitch, arguing that she knew his insecurity about his size and used that to retaliate. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The guy crossed a line by making a personal comment about her weight after she answered a question she found intrusive. The author's response of asking about his insecurities might be a form of retaliation, but it's a direct response to his behavior. However, the question is whether she was in the wrong. \n\nThe guy initiated the personal question, which the author found uncomfortable. Her response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was a reaction to his comments. The friends' judgment of her seems to be based on the idea that she used his known insecurity against him, but the initial harm was from him. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally frowned upon to make personal comments about someone's body, especially in a context where it can be hurtful. The guy's actions were the first transgression. The author's response, while maybe not the most constructive, was a reaction to being made to feel bad. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It seems like the guy started the problematic behavior, and her response was a reaction. However, using someone's insecurity as a retort can be seen as using the same tactics. But given that he didn't apologize and the friends blamed her, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, when someone is on the receiving end of a hurtful comment, retaliating with their own insecurity might be seen as justified in self-defense of boundaries. However, some might argue that it's still not the right approach. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. The guy's initial question and comments were the issue, and her response was a way to assert her boundaries. The friends' reaction is more about victim-blaming. So, answer B.\n"
