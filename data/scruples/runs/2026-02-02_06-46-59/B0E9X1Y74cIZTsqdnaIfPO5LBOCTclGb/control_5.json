Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking the guy how big his dick is after he asked her weight. \n\nFirst, the context: the guy asked her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size as a way to show him her perspective. The guy didn't respond and got embarrassed. His friends called her an asshole because she knew he was insecure about his dick size.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is whether her response was appropriate. Let's consider the social norms here. Asking someone's weight can be sensitive, especially if it's a personal question. The guy's follow-up comment about her not being morbidly fat came off as harsh, and she felt judged. Her asking about his dick size was a direct response to his insecurity, which she was aware of. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to use someone's insecurity against them? Even if she had a point about the double standard, using his insecurity in that way might not be the best approach. However, he did start by asking a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She tried to make him see her perspective by mirroring his behavior. \n\nThe key here is whether her action was a justified response or an overreaction. She felt she was being judged and wanted to show the double standard. But using a similarly personal and potentially embarrassing question could be seen as taking it too far, even if her intention was to highlight the inconsistency. \n\nAlso, his friends criticized her for using his insecurity, which complicates things. But the guy didn't apologize, so maybe he was in the wrong for asking the weight question and then being defensive. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both weight and dick size are sensitive topics. The guy initiated the personal question. The author's response might be seen as a form of pointing out the hypocrisy, but it's possible that her method wasn't the best. However, considering the context, she was trying to communicate her discomfort and the double standard. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she was responding to his personal question and highlighting the double standard. However, the way she did it might have been unkind, but given the premise of the situation, it's understandable. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
