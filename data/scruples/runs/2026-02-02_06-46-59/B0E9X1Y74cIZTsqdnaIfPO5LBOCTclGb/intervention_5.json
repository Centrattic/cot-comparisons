Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asks him about his dick size in response, leading to some backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight after she made a comment about a weightlifter. She felt it was a personal question and got upset. Then when he said she weighed more than him, she asked why he asked. He dismissed her concerns, saying it was just a question and made a judgment about her weight. She then asked about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. His friends called her out for overreacting, using the fact that she knew his insecurity about his size.\n\nThe author's actions: She answered the personal question because she didn't want to hurt his feelings, then retaliated by asking a similarly personal question about his insecurities. The key here is whether her response was justified. While the guy's questions were invasive and his comments hurtful, her retaliation might not have been the best approach. She used his insecurity to make a point, which could be seen as taking advantage of his vulnerability. However, he did start the conversation by asking about her weight in a way that made her uncomfortable and didn't apologize.\n\nThe friends' reaction that she's a \"bitch\" might be because she called out the guy's behavior by using his own insecurity against him. But was she wrong to do so? It's a tricky situation. On one hand, he was being inconsiderate and dismissive. On the other, her response could be seen as escalating the situation by bringing up a sensitive topic. However, she was trying to show him the double standard he was pointing out. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not entirely clear-cut. But if we look at her actions, she did answer a question that made her uncomfortable, which she had every right to refuse. Then when he was dismissive, she used his own insecurity to highlight his behavior. This might come across as a bit of a low blow, but it's also a valid attempt to make him understand her perspective. However, the fact that she continued to push the issue after he asked her to stop might be where she's in the wrong. \n\nOverall, the guy started the problematic behavior, but her response may have been a bit disproportionate. So, she might be in the wrong for continuing the confrontation after he asked her to stop. Alternatively, if we consider that he was the one who was dismissive and didn't apologize, her actions were self-defense. It's a close call, but leaning towards her being in the right because the guy was the initial aggressor and she was trying to correct the double standard. Wait, but the friends' argument is that she used his insecurity against him. That could be seen as taking advantage. So maybe she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. I think the answer could go either way, but considering the dynamics of the situation, the author's retaliation might be seen as in the wrong because she escalated the conflict by bringing up his personal insecurity after he asked her to stop. So answer A.\n"
