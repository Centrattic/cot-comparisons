Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighs during a date. The author felt uncomfortable and then got angry when he made a comment about her weight being higher than his. She confronted him, and he defended himself by talking about double standards. Then, she asked about his dick size to make him see her perspective, but his friends think she's in the wrong because she used his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and even though he might have thought it was a casual question, the way she felt is valid. People have different sensitivities, and if someone crosses a line, the responsibility isn't entirely on the person who feels hurt. \n\nNext, when the guy made the comment about her weight, that's where the issue really escalated. Even if he didn't mean it to be hurtful, making a comparison about someone's weight can be triggering. The author's reaction of asking about his dick size was her way of showing the double standard he mentioned. She used his known insecurity to mirror his behavior. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The guy initiated the conversation about weight, and she responded with a question about his private body part. But the difference is that weight is often a topic people are sensitive about, and in many cultures, commenting on someone's weight is considered rude. However, the guy's friends are saying she's overreacting because he didn't know her sensitivity, but she knew his about his size. \n\nBut wait, the guy's comment was about her weight, which he might not have realized was offensive. The author felt it was a personal and offensive question, and her response was to turn the tables. However, asking someone about their genital size is also a personal and potentially offensive question. So, is her action an appropriate response, or is she escalating the situation?\n\nOn one hand, she was trying to make him see the double standard. On the other hand, by asking his size, she might have taken the conversation to an equally personal and uncomfortable place. The guy's friends are pointing out that she used his insecurity, which might mean she had the upper hand in that situation. \n\nBut also, the initial question from the guy was the trigger. He asked her a question that she found personal, and his follow-up comment made her uncomfortable. Her asking his question could be seen as a form of teaching a lesson, but maybe it's not fair to compare the two topics directly. Weight and genital size are both sensitive, but societal norms might treat them differently. Weight can be seen as a health issue, while genital size is more about personal insecurities. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, and his friends are blaming her. The author's intention was to show the double standard, but maybe she crossed a line by using his insecurity against him. However, if he was inconsiderate in asking her about her weight, she had a right to express her discomfort. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's response was justified. If the guy had made a comment about her height or something else she's insecure about, and then she asked about his genital size, is that a fair comparison? Maybe not, because the initial question was from him. The problem is that both topics are personal, but the guy's comment was more about a health-related issue, which can be more sensitive. \n\nAlso, the guy's friends are calling her the asshole because she knew his insecurity. But the guy started the conversation by asking about her weight. So, there's a balance here. Perhaps the author was justified in her reaction, but her method of responding might have been inappropriate. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable and standing up for herself, but maybe the way she responded could have been handled differently. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the guy initiated the sensitive topic, and her response was a direct consequence of his actions, she might not be the asshole. But it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
