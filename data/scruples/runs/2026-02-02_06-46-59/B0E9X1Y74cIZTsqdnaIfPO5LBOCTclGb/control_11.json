Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his penis size to highlight the double standard. The friends later called her an asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around these questions. Asking someone's weight is often seen as intrusive or offensive, especially since body weight can be sensitive. The guy's comment that she's not morbidly fat but still implied a judgment might have been hurtful. \n\nThen, when the author asked about his penis size, that's a personal question too. However, she did so as a way to mirror his behavior and make him understand the discomfort he caused. The friends' reaction suggests they see this as using his insecurity, but was that justified?\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable way to address the discomfort. While both topics are personal, the initial question from the guy was the catalyst. Her response might be seen as a form of retaliation to highlight the double standard he mentioned. However, some might argue that asking about his penis size was crossing a line, regardless of the intent.\n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the action. The author's intention was to make him see her perspective, which could be seen as constructive. However, the method (using his known insecurity) might be problematic. The friends' judgment is based on the idea that she took advantage of his insecurities, which complicates the issue.\n\nIn the end, the guy didn't apologize, and the author stood up for her boundaries. Socially, it's often acceptable to hold others accountable for making others uncomfortable. But there's a fine line between defending oneself and retaliating in kind. The friends' labeling her as the asshole might be influenced by their loyalty to him, but it doesn't necessarily make them right.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were a reaction to being made uncomfortable, and while the method might be debatable, the core issue is the guy's initial inappropriate question. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
