Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then retaliated by asking about his dick size, leading to backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and it's reasonable for her to feel uncomfortable. He then followed up with a comment that came off as judgmental, even if he meant it literally. The author's reaction was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal topic. While she might have been trying to illustrate the double standard, bringing up his insecurity in that way could be seen as using his vulnerability against him, which isn't fair.\n\nThe friends' reaction was that she took advantage of his insecurity. Even if she didn't intend to, by confronting him with a personal question, she might have crossed a line. The key here is the intent vs. the impact. She might have thought it was a way to teach him a lesson about how personal questions can hurt, but the method was harsh. People have different sensitivities, and she knew about his insecurity regarding his dick size. Using that knowledge to mirror his behavior could be seen as inconsiderate, even if she had a point about the double standard.\n\nOn the other hand, he initiated the personal questioning, so she had a valid reason to push back. But the way she did it by asking about his dick size might have been a disproportionate response, especially in the context of their conversation. It's possible she's right in standing up for herself, but the approach might have been misguided. The question is whether her action was a justified stand against his behavior or if she overstepped. The friends' reaction suggests that they saw it as an overreaction, but their judgment might be biased.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's retaliation, while perhaps intended to make a point, might have been too harsh given the personal nature of the question. So she could be considered in the wrong for using his insecurity to retaliate, even if her initial discomfort was valid.\n"
