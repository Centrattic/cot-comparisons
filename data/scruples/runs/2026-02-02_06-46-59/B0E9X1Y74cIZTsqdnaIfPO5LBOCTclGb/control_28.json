Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking the guy about his dick size after he asked her about her weight. \n\nFirst, the context: The guy asked her weight during a date, which she found uncomfortable. He then made a comment that she interpreted as offensive, leading her to confront him. In response, she asked about his dick size, which he didn't like. His friends are now calling her the asshole because they think she used his insecurity against him, even though he initially brought up a sensitive topic.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and mutual respect in personal questions. The guy's question about her weight was invasive, especially since weight can be a sensitive topic. She felt uncomfortable and rightfully so. His comment about her weight being \"ok\" but not \"morbidly fat\" is dismissive and could be seen as minimizing her feelings. \n\nWhen she asked about his dick size, it's a direct response to his personal question. However, the ethics here depend on whether the response was proportional or an attempt to retaliate. Since the guy initiated the personal question, her response might be seen as an equal exchange. However, some might argue that it's not fair to use someone's insecurity against them, even if they started it. \n\nThe friends' reactions suggest that in their view, she overstepped by using his insecurity, but it's also possible they're defending him without understanding her perspective. The guy didn't apologize, which could indicate he didn't acknowledge her discomfort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the initial problem was his question about her weight, which was invasive. Her response was a way to show him how personal such questions are. While it's a tricky situation, the person who started the sensitive topic was him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for responding in kind, especially since she had already addressed the issue with him and he didn't apologize. The friends' judgment might be biased. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
