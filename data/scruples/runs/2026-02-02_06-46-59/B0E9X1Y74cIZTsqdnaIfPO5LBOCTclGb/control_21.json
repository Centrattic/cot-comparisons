Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable because she perceives it as a comment on her body. She then responds by asking about his penis size, leading to conflict. The friends are calling her an asshole. So, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked her weight after discussing a fitness post. She felt it was personal and offensive, especially when he followed up with a comment about his own weight. She then asked about his penis size to make him see her perspective. He got embarrassed and didn't apologize. His friends think she overreacted.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. Asking someone's weight can be sensitive, especially in a dating context. It's often seen as a personal question and can make people uncomfortable because it's tied to body image issues. The guy might have thought it was innocent, but the author had a right to feel offended. His comment about her weight not being \"morbidly fat\" could have been dismissive and hurtful.\n\nWhen she asked about his penis size, it was a direct response to his insecurity. But using his insecurity as a way to make a point might be seen as using his vulnerability. However, she was trying to show him the impact of his question by putting him in a similar situation. But maybe that's not the best approach. People might see it as using his insecurity against him, which could be why her friends criticized her.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she had the right to express her discomfort. However, her response (asking about his penis size) could be seen as retaliatory and possibly using his insecurity to make a point. But considering the context, her action was a form of perspective-taking. The key is whether her actions were within bounds to communicate her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy asked a personal question inappropriately. He didn't apologize and instead blamed her for being too sensitive. His friends' reactions suggest they don't see his behavior as problematic. But the author's response, while maybe a bit harsh, was an attempt to make him understand her feelings.\n\nSo, the author isn't entirely wrong. She had the right to be uncomfortable and to express that. However, her method of using his insecurity might not have been the best way to handle it. But overall, the initial question from the guy was the main issue. The author responding in kind to show him her perspective isn't entirely in the wrong. The friends' judgment of her as an asshole is likely misplaced. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
