Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author her weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she asked him about his dick size in response. The guy didn't apologize, and her friends are calling her an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked her weight after they were on a date, which she found personal and uncomfortable. She answered but was upset by his comment about her weight. Then she asked him about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. The friends think she took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider social norms and mutual respect. Asking about someone's weight is a sensitive topic and can be seen as invasive. The guy's comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat might come off as judgmental. The author's response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal question. However, she did it to mirror the discomfort she felt, which is a form of pointing out hypocrisy. \n\nIs it fair for her to ask him about his insecurities after he asked her? The guy was already known to be insecure about his size, so using that as a response might be seen as exploiting his vulnerability. But on the other hand, she was trying to show him the double standard. \n\nThe friends' reaction is another angle. They think she overreacted because he didn't know her insecurities, but she knew his. But that doesn't mean it's okay for him to bring up her weight. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. Asking about his dick size in retaliation could be seen as equalizing the situation, but it's still a personal question. However, her main point was to highlight the double standard in how personal questions are treated. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties might have contributed. The guy shouldn't have asked her weight in the first place, and the author shouldn't have retaliated with a similarly personal question. However, the context is important. She was trying to make him see the problem with his behavior. \n\nBut is her action in the wrong? If the goal was to teach him a lesson, it might be a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. However, it's also a way to show the hypocrisy. The friends' judgment of her as a \"bitch\" might stem from traditional views where such questions are seen as okay for men to ask women but not the other way around. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was a reaction to being made uncomfortable by his question. She used his known insecurity to mirror his behavior. While both topics are sensitive, the initial question from him was the instigator. However, her response might not be justified because it's still a personal and potentially hurtful question. But given the context of trying to highlight the double standard, maybe it's a valid response. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms. If it's considered a double standard to ask about a woman's weight but not a man's size, then she's pointing that out. However, directly asking in a confrontational way could be seen as rude. \n\nI think the author's action was a way to address the hypocrisy without being confrontational. However, it's still a personal question. So, is she in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. The guy's initial question was inappropriate, and her response was trying to correct that by showing the double standard. But maybe the method was not the best. However, the friends' judgment of her as the asshole is likely misplaced. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
