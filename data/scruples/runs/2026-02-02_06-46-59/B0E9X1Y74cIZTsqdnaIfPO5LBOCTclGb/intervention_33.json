Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. The author found it uncomfortable and then asked about his dick size in response. The friends are saying the author used the guy's insecurity against him, making her the asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nHmm. So, boundaries. The guy asked a personal question, which made her uncomfortable. She responded with a different personal question. But is that fair? Using someone's insecurity to point out their bad behavior? Maybe she's defending her right to feel uncomfortable and set boundaries. But the friends are upset because she weaponized his insecurity. \n\nOn one hand, asking about weight is intrusive. On the other, using his own insecurity as a retort might be seen as unfair. But is it the author's fault for pointing out the double standard? The guy started by asking a personal question and then defended it by talking about double standards. She tried to show the hypocrisy by asking about his insecurity. \n\nBut maybe she overstepped by bringing up his private matters. However, if he was already talking about double standards, she's using it to highlight the inconsistency. The friends' judgment is harsh, but does that mean she's the asshole? Or was she just trying to make him see his own behavior? \n\nI think it's a bit nuanced. But the key is whether she was in the wrong. If she felt his question was inappropriate and used his own insecurities to make him realize, maybe it's justified. But others might see it as using his vulnerability. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because she's setting boundaries and pointing out hypocrisy. Alternatively, maybe A if she should have just addressed the issue without bringing up his insecurity. But the guy was the one who brought up the double standard. She's using his own words against him. So B makes sense here.\n"
