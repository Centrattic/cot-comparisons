Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asks him about his dick size in response. The guy didn't apologize, and her friends are calling her the asshole.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found personal and uncomfortable. Weight is a common sensitive topic, so his question might have been inappropriate. She tried to handle it politely but then he made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she took as an insult. She confronted him, and he defended his actions, talking about double standards. She then used his insecurity about his dick size to mirror his question, which made him embarrassed.\n\nThe friends are now saying she overreacted because she knew about his insecurity. But the key points here are: 1. The guy initiated a personal question about weight, which is a sensitive topic. 2. He followed up with a comment that came off as judgmental. 3. She tried to make him see her perspective by asking a reciprocal question. 4. He didn't apologize, and the friends are blaming her.\n\nI think the guy started the issue by asking a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She was within her rights to express her discomfort. Using his insecurity as a counter might not be the best approach, but it's a reaction to his behavior. The friends' judgment is misplaced because the initial question was from him. So she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
