Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking about his dick size, which led to backlash from his friends.\n\nFirst, weight is a sensitive topic. The guy initiating a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable, is problematic. He then made a comment that sounded like a judgment, which made her angry. She asked why he asked, and he dismissed her feelings, calling her sensitive. \n\nShe retorted by asking about his dick size, which he found embarrassing. His friends later criticized her for overreacting, using his insecurity against him. The author tried to mirror his behavior to show its impact, but the friends saw it as taking advantage.\n\nNow, the key is whether her response was justified. She felt wronged by his question and his dismissive attitude. By asking about his insecurity, she tried to make him see how his actions affected her. However, using his personal insecurity as a counter might be seen as unfair, especially since he didn't know about her sensitivity. \n\nBut the initial issue was his invasive question. The author had the right to express discomfort. The friends' reaction is also about the double standard in what's considered acceptable to ask. Her response, while perhaps not the best approach, was an attempt to hold him accountable. \n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to his disrespectful behavior. While it might not be the most constructive response, it's a form of pointing out the hypocrisy. However, she could have addressed it without using his insecurity. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author might not be in the wrong. The guy's actions were the initial problem, and her response, though maybe not the best method, was a reaction to his behavior. The friends' judgment of her as an \"overreacting bitch\" reflects their own biases. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
