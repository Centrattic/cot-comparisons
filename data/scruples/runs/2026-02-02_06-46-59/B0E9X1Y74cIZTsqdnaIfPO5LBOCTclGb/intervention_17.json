Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his penis size as a way to show him her perspective. The friends are calling her an asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight. While it's true that weight can be a sensitive topic, some people might see it as a straightforward question. However, asking someone's weight can be seen as intrusive, especially if it's not a common topic of conversation. The guy's follow-up comment about her weight being \"ok\" and his own weight was hurtful, so she had a valid reason to be upset.\n\nWhen the author asked about his penis size, she was trying to mirror his behavior to make a point. This is a form of tit-for-tat, which can be effective in making someone realize how their actions affect others. However, using someone's insecurity in this way might be seen as manipulative. The friends' reaction suggests they view this as taking advantage of his vulnerability. \n\nBut the key here is intent. The author's intention was to show him the impact of his question by putting him in a similar situation. While it's a form of emotional manipulation, it's also a response to his prior hurtful behavior. The guy didn't apologize, and the friends are quick to judge the author without considering her side. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The guy asked a personal question and made a comment that hurt her, so he's not blameless. The author's response, while perhaps not the most graceful, was an attempt to correct his behavior. However, using his insecurity might have been an overreaction. \n\nConsidering social norms, asking about someone's weight is generally more offensive than asking about penis size in a private context. But the author's action was in response to being made to feel judged. The friends' judgment is harsh because they don't fully understand the context. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky call. She acted in self-defense to an extent, but using his insecurity could be seen as exploiting a sensitive topic. However, given the guy's initial behavior, her response might be justified. I think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong, but there's a case for both sides. Maybe the best answer is B (No), because she was responding to his actions and trying to make him see her perspective, even if her method was questionable.\n"
