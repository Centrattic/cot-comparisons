Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking the guy about his dick size after he asked her about her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. She answered but then got upset when he said she weighed more than him and made a comment about her weight. Then she confronted him, he defended himself, and she asked about his dick size to mirror his insecurity. Her friends called her an asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though he didn't know about hers.\n\nHmm. So, the guy asked a personal question about her weight, which she found intrusive. He made a comment that she felt was judgmental. She then mirrored his behavior by asking a similarly personal question about his body. The friends think she's at fault because she used his insecurities against him, even though he didn't know hers. \n\nBut why does the author think it's okay? Maybe because the guy started it by asking her weight, which led to an uncomfortable conversation. She felt she needed to show him how she felt by asking a reciprocal question. However, others might argue that even if he was rude, she escalated the situation by asking about his body, which is also personal. Also, the friends' reaction suggests that using someone's known insecurity against them is seen as taking advantage, regardless of the initial provocation.\n\nBut is it about intent? She said she wanted to show him her perspective, which was valid. However, using a personal question about his body might not be the most constructive way to do that. It could be seen as a form of retaliation. On the other hand, the guy initiated the personal question first, so maybe it's a cycle of mutual intrusiveness. The key issue is whether her response was an appropriate way to address his behavior.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking about someone's weight is generally considered rude, and doing so in a way that makes them feel judged is worse. The guy's comment about her weight, implying she's not morbidly fat but still making a comparison, is problematic. The author's response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a sensitive topic. However, since he was known to be insecure about that, she might have thought it would make him understand her discomfort. \n\nThe friends are upset because they see it as her exploiting his vulnerability, which could be seen as unfair since he didn't know about hers. But does that matter? If he was the one who started by asking her a personal question, maybe she had a reason to respond in kind. However, using someone's insecurity against them can be seen as manipulative, even if it's to highlight a double standard. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he started by asking a personal question and made her feel judged. On the other, she retaliated with a question that is also personal and potentially hurtful. However, the fact that she was trying to show him her perspective might mitigate her responsibility a bit. But the friends' perspective is that she took advantage of his known insecurity, which could be seen as using that against him in a way that's not fair. \n\nI think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong because the guy initiated the personal question and made her uncomfortable. She was trying to make him see her perspective by mirroring his behavior, which is a valid communication strategy. However, the method might be questionable. But since the question was in response to his actions, she's not entirely at fault. The friends are biased because they support the guy. So the answer is B (No).\n"
