Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a situation where they asked a guy about his penis size following him asking about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The guy asked her weight during a date, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his penis size as a way to show him how she felt about his intrusive question. The guy didn't respond and got embarrassed, but the author's friends are now calling her an asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy asked a personal question about her weight, she responded and then he made a comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat. She felt judged, so she asked him a similarly personal question about his penis size to make a point. \n\nNow, the debate is whether her response was justified. On one hand, she's responding to his personal question with another personal question, using his insecurity. On the other hand, he initiated the conversation with a sensitive topic that made her uncomfortable. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone their weight can be considered rude, especially if it's done in a way that makes the person feel judged. The guy's comment about her weight being okay but not morbidly fat might have been an attempt to be kind, but it came off as harsh. The author's response was to mirror his behavior by asking about his penis size, which is also a personal and sensitive topic. \n\nThe friends are criticizing her for exploiting his insecurity, but they might not be considering that he started the conversation by asking a question that she found intrusive. However, retaliating with a question about his penis size might not be the best approach. Using someone's insecurity against them can be seen as manipulative, even if it's to make a point. \n\nAlso, the guy's defense about a double standard is problematic. While it's true that some people can be judgmental about body image, bringing up weight versus genital size are different in terms of societal norms. Weight is often a more openly discussed topic, albeit still sensitive, whereas genital size is typically considered more private. \n\nThe author's intention was to make him understand her discomfort, but the method might have been inappropriate. Instead of asking a personal question, she could have addressed the issue directly without reciprocating in kind. \n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties have some responsibility. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, but the author's response escalated the situation. However, since the friends are blaming her, it's important to consider whether her response was a reasonable reaction to his initial transgression. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action was a proportionate response. While the guy's question was inappropriate, asking about his penis size might not be the best way to address it. The author might be in the wrong for using his insecurity against him, even if she felt he was in the wrong first. It's possible that her approach wasn't the most constructive, hence making her the asshole in the eyes of some. \n\nBut another angle is that she was trying to highlight the problem with his behavior by mirroring it. However, using someone's insecurity in that way can be seen as cruel, even if the intent was to teach a lesson. The friends' reaction might be influenced by the fact that they know his insecurity and see her as exploiting that. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because her response, while perhaps motivated by a desire to show his insensitivity, used his personal insecurity in a way that could be seen as manipulative or cruel. Even if the initial question was inappropriate, retaliating with another personal question might not be the right approach.\n"
