Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighs. The author felt uncomfortable and later asked him about his penis size to show her perspective. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy asked about her weight, then made a comment that made her feel judged. She responded by asking about his penis size, which he found embarrassing. The friends think she overreacted and took advantage of his insecurity.\n\nHmm. So, the guy's question about weight was probably a breach of personal boundaries. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and asking it directly might come off as rude or intrusive. The author's initial reaction of discomfort is valid. Then, when the guy made a comment about her weight being higher than his, that could be seen as dismissive or even hurtful. He tried to justify it by saying it's a \"just a question\" and mentioned a double standard about discrimination, which might not be the right approach.\n\nNow, the author's response was to ask about his penis size. The friends argue that she knew he was insecure about that and used it to shame him. But the author's intention was to make him understand her perspective. Is this a fair way to respond? Well, asking about his penis size after he made her uncomfortable with his comments could be seen as retaliatory. Even if her intention was to show him how it feels, using personal and sensitive topics as a counterattack might not be the best approach. It could come across as mean or bullying, especially if it's done to make someone feel embarrassed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did confront him about his insensitive comment and tried to explain her feelings. That part is reasonable. But using his own insecurity against him in a public or semi-public setting (with friends present, even if they weren't there at the time) could be problematic. It's like saying, \"You're wrong for being rude, so here's a personal question about your insecurities.\" That might not be effective communication and could hurt the other person.\n\nAlso, the guy didn't apologize, which is a red flag. If someone is making you feel bad, it's important for them to acknowledge that. But the author's response might have escalated the situation instead of resolving it. The friends' reactions suggest that they see her as attacking his insecurity, which might be true in their eyes. However, the initial question from him was the catalyst.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the guy overstepped by asking about her weight and making a judgment. The author had the right to express her discomfort. But her method of doing so by asking a personal and potentially hurtful question about his penis size might cross a line. It's a form of retaliation that uses personal insecurities against someone else, which isn't fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for the way she responded, even if the initial situation wasn't her fault.\n"
