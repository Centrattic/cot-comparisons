Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighs during a date. She felt uncomfortable and then he made a comment about her weight being more than his. She got angry and asked why he asked, leading to a discussion about double standards. Then she asked him about his dick size, which made him embarrassed. The guy didn't apologize, and his friends called her a bitch for using his insecurity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy initiated by asking about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. The author felt uncomfortable and responded with \"excuse me?\" but answered. Then he made a comment comparing their weights, which she interpreted as her being fat. His response about her being \"ok\" and not morbidly fat might have been meant to be reassuring, but it came across as harsh. She confronted him about the personal question, and he defended himself by talking about double standards between men's insecurities (like height) and women's (like weight). \n\nThen, she asked about his dick size as a way to show him her perspective. He got embarrassed and didn't apologize. His friends criticized her for using his insecurity. The author's friends think she's the asshole because she knew about his insecurity and used it against him, even though the guy didn't know about her weight insecurities.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and reciprocity. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She felt it was inappropriate, and he didn't apologize. Then she asked a question about his insecurities. The friends are saying she's using his insecurity, but he had brought up the topic of weight first. The author's response might be seen as a fair reaction to his initial intrusion into her personal space.\n\nBut maybe the issue is that she took it further by asking about his dick size, which could be considered a personal question as well. However, she did it to highlight the double standard he mentioned. The guy didn't apologize, so she's in a dilemma where she's being criticized by his friends for defending herself. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The guy initiated the personal question, and she had a right to feel uncomfortable. His comments about her weight were not well-received, and he didn't apologize. Her asking about his dick size could be a way to show the double standard he was talking about, but maybe it was taken as an attack. However, considering the context of his friends' reactions, they might not understand the nuance. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if someone asks a personal question that makes you uncomfortable, you have the right to address it. The author tried to explain her perspective, but the guy's friends are quick to judge her. The guy's own behavior was problematic (asking about weight, making a comment, not apologizing), so the author's response might be justified. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
