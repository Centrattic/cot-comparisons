Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him how big his penis is in response. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around personal questions. Weight is often considered a sensitive topic, especially for women, and can be seen as a personal or even offensive question. The guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. Then he made a comment that she \"weighs more than me,\" which she interpreted as implying she's fat. That could be a rude remark, even if he didn't mean to be offensive. \n\nWhen she confronted him, he defended himself by saying it was just a question and mentioned a double standard about height and weight. He also brought up that he's insecure about his penis size, which the author then used to ask him about it. The friends are upset because she used his insecurity against him, even though she was responding to his question about her weight.\n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual respect and understanding boundaries. If he asked her a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and then made a comment she found offensive, her response was to ask him a similar question about his own insecurity. The friends argue that she knew about his insecurity and used that to make him uncomfortable, which is why they call her the asshole. \n\nBut is it fair? If someone asks you a personal question that you're not comfortable with, and then makes a derogatory comment, is it wrong to respond with a similar question to show how it feels? It might be a form of tit for tat, but whether that's acceptable depends on the situation. However, using someone's insecurity against them can be seen as manipulative, even if it's in response to their own behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial question and comment were inappropriate, and the author was defending her boundaries. But by asking about his penis size, she might have crossed a line, especially since it's a sensitive topic for him. The friends' reaction is based on the idea that she used his known insecurity to retaliate, which they perceive as overstepping. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. She had the right to set boundaries when he asked her about her weight, but her response might have been a bit harsh. However, the guy's initial actions were also disrespectful. The friends' judgment might be influenced by their own views on gender dynamics and double standards. \n\nI think the main issue is whether her response was a justified reaction to his behavior. If she felt uncomfortable and wanted to show him how it feels to be asked a personal question, then maybe it's a form of self-defense in communication. But since it's about body insecurity, which is a sensitive topic, she might have overstepped. However, the guy's initial question was also inappropriate. \n\nGiven that the friends are labeling her as the asshole, and the situation is about mutual respect and boundaries, it's possible that the author is in the wrong for using his insecurity against him, even if his question was rude. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a complex social dynamic where both parties might have made mistakes. But according to the options given, the answer is either A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. \n\nConsidering that the author responded in kind to a personal question and used his known insecurity, which the friends found to be manipulative, the answer might be A. However, the guy's initial question was also inappropriate. But in terms of who is in the wrong, the author's retaliation might be seen as the more offensive action because it's a direct hit on a known insecurity. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
