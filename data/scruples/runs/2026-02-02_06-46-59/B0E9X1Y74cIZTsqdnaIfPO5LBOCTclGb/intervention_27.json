Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, there's the situation where the guy asked her weight. That's a sensitive question, and many people find it uncomfortable. The author mentions that they answered despite their discomfort. Then the guy made a comment about her weight being higher than his, which made her feel targeted. She asked for the point of the question, and he responded with a harsh comment about her not being morbidly fat. She felt this was rude and confrontational. \n\nShe then asked about his penis size as a way to mirror the perceived judgment, which embarrassed him. The guy's friends later called her an overreacting bitch, arguing that she took advantage of his insecurity. The author is seeking validation on whether she was in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and how to handle sensitive topics. The guy's initial question about weight was intrusive and possibly disrespectful. His follow-up comments were hurtful. The author's response, while perhaps confrontational, was an attempt to show him the impact of his words. However, asking about his penis size might be seen as using his insecurity against him, which his friends argue is hypocritical. \n\nBut weight and body size are often topics where people have insecurities. The guy's insensitivity in bringing up her weight and making a judgment could be seen as the root issue. The author's reaction, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was in response to his prior comments. The friends' judgment of her is harsh, as they didn't fully understand the context of his initial harshness. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The guy's behavior started the conflict with an uncomfortable question and a harsh comment. The author's response was a defense mechanism to highlight the double standard. While her method might not have been perfect, the initiating party's actions were problematic. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
