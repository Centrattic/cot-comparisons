Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a guy asking about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, leading her to ask about his dick size in return. The guy didn't apologize, and others in their friend group called her an asshole for using his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, the initial question: the guy asked how much she weighs. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and the author felt uncomfortable, which is valid. He then made a comment that she weighed more than him, which she interpreted as implying she was fat. His follow-up about it being a \"double standard\" because men can't help their height but can their weight is problematic. That's a flawed argument, as it's not true that men can't help their weight. \n\nWhen the author asked about his dick size, it was in response to his comments and to make a point about the double standard he mentioned. The guy got embarrassed and didn't apologize. The friends blamed her for using his insecurity, but the guy was the one who brought up a sensitive topic and then became defensive.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a fair reaction to his initial inappropriate question and comments. Using his known insecurity to highlight the double standard could be seen as a form of countermeasure, especially since he was the one who started the conversation about personal, sensitive topics. The friends' reaction seems to be shifting blame onto her, which might not be fair. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she was responding to someone who initiated a personal and uncomfortable conversation. Her actions were a reaction to being made to feel judged, and using his known insecurity to make a point is a valid response in this context. The guy's defensiveness and the friends' judgment of her don't absolve him of the initial transgression.\n"
