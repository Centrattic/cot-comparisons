Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after asking the guy about his dick size in response to him commenting on her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She answered but felt he was being harsh when he said she weighed more than him. She confronted him, and he didn't apologize. Then she asked about his dick size to make him see her perspective. He got embarrassed, and his friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual respect and consent in conversations. The guy asked a personal question about her weight, which is sensitive. She felt he was being judgmental when he said she weighed more than him, which is a problematic way to frame it. She tried to explain her discomfort and then asked a personal question back. But asking about his dick size is a different kind of personal topic. While she was trying to show empathy for his insecurity, she went into a topic that's typically even more private. However, he had initiated the conversation by making a comment about her weight in a way that hurt her feelings. \n\nThe guy's friends said she took advantage of his insecurity, but he had already brought up her weight in a way that was hurtful. She was defending her boundaries. Asking the question was a way to illustrate how personal comments can make someone uncomfortable. Even if it was a bit of a sharp move, she was responding to his earlier transgression. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, and his friends were quick to side with him, which might be because of his insecurity. But the root issue is that both were insecure and brought up personal topics without considering the other's feelings. However, the guy started by making a comment about her weight that she found hurtful. She was trying to correct the behavior, even if her method was a bit confrontational. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. She was responding to his hurtful comment by showing him how personal questions can affect someone. The answer is B.\n"
