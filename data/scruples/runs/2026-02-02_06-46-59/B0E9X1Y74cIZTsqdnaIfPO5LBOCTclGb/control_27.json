Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the scenario is that a guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size in response. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around personal questions. Asking someone's weight can be seen as intrusive because it's a sensitive topic for many people. The guy might not have realized that, but the fact that it made her uncomfortable is valid. She did handle it by explaining her feelings, which is a reasonable approach.\n\nThen, when he asked about her weight, she answered, but his comment about her weighing more than him and making a judgment about her weight was crossing a line. His follow-up about a double standard and how guys can be discriminatory about weight (which they can control, unlike height) seems like he's justifying his own behavior. That's problematic because it dismisses her feelings and introduces a harmful comparison.\n\nWhen she asked about his dick size, it was a direct response to his personal question. It's a way of showing him the double standard\u2014his question was personal and made her uncomfortable, so she mirrored that with a question about his insecurity. While it's a bit of a direct approach, it's a form of pointing out the hypocrisy in his argument. However, using someone's insecurity in that way could be seen as a bit of a low blow, even if it's to make a point.\n\nThe friend group's reaction is also telling. They're defending the guy and calling her an overreacting bitch. That might indicate some social pressure where men's insecurities are accepted or excused, while women's reactions are dismissed. The author is trying to highlight that double standard by using his own vulnerability against him, which the friends find offensive.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she had the right to express her discomfort after he asked a personal question. His behavior was inconsiderate, and her response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was an attempt to make him see her perspective. The friends' judgment of her as the asshole might be more about defending the guy's actions rather than acknowledging her valid feelings. \n\nIn the end, the key points are that the guy's question was inappropriate, he didn't apologize, and she was trying to communicate her boundaries. Her action of asking about his dick size was a reaction to his argument about double standards. While it's a bit of a sharp move, it's a form of pointing out the inconsistency in his reasoning. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
