Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable, leading her to ask him about his dick size in response. The friends are now calling her an asshole for using his insecurity.\n\nFirst, the guy asked a personal question about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and the author felt uncomfortable. She answered but then felt slighted by his comment about her weighing more than him. His response to her discomfort was dismissive and even rude, which is not acceptable. \n\nThen, when he started ranting about double standards, she used his known insecurity about his penis size to counter his argument. This led to her being criticized by his friends. The friends argue that she took advantage of his insecurity, even though he had previously invaded her personal space with the weight question.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and the appropriateness of the questions. The guy's initial question was personal and made her uncomfortable. His response to her discomfort was not empathetic. The author's retort was a direct response to his argument, using his own insecurity. While her method was confrontational, it was a reaction to his inappropriate behavior. \n\nWhether she's in the wrong depends on the context. She was defending her boundaries after he crossed them. However, asking about his penis size might be seen as using his vulnerability against him, which could be considered manipulative. But considering the guy's dismissive and rude behavior, her action was a form of pushing back. \n\nThe friends' reactions might be biased, as they are his mates. The author was in her right to set boundaries, but the method might be debatable. However, the main wrongdoing was the guy's initial invasion of her privacy and his subsequent defensiveness. The author's response, while perhaps not the most mature, was a reaction to his actions. So, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
