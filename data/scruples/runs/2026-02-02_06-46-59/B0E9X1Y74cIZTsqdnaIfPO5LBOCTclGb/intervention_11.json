Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is at fault. The situation involves a date where the guy asks the woman about her weight, which makes her uncomfortable. She then asks him about his penis size in response, which he finds embarrassing. His friends later call her an overreacting bitch. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sequence of events. The guy asked her how much she weighs, which she found uncomfortable. She answered, and then he made a comment about her weight compared to his. She then confronts him, asking what the point was, and he defends himself. She uses his insecurity about his penis size to ask him how big it is, which he doesn't respond to. He doesn't apologize, and her friends side against her.\n\nSo, the key issues here are about personal boundaries and how both parties reacted. The guy crossed a boundary by asking about her weight in a way that made her feel uncomfortable. His comment about her weight being higher than his could be seen as judgmental, especially since weight is a sensitive topic. She then uses his known insecurity (about penis size) to make a point, which he finds embarrassing. \n\nNow, whether she was in the wrong. Asking about penis size is definitely a personal and sensitive question. Even though she was trying to make him see her perspective by returning the favor, it's possible she escalated the situation. However, the initial problem was his question about her weight, which she found offensive. She might have felt justified in responding in kind, but it's a bit of a tit-for-tat scenario.\n\nThe guy's friends are criticizing her for taking advantage of his insecurity, but they might not understand the context of his comments about her weight. On the other hand, she did use his insecurity to make a point, which could be seen as unfair. But the root of the conflict was his initial inappropriate question.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone's weight is generally considered intrusive. Similarly, asking about penis size is also a taboo topic. However, the guy's actions started the conflict. She tried to make him see her side by mirroring his behavior, which might not be the best approach, but it's hard to say who is entirely at fault here. The question is whether she was in the wrong. \n\nHer asking about his size was a personal reaction to his question, but it's a direct and potentially hurtful response. However, his initial question was also inappropriate. So maybe both are at fault to some extent. But the question is specifically about the author (her) being in the wrong. If the guy's question was the main issue, then she's responding in a way that highlights the double standard he pointed out. But by doing so, she's also engaging in a personal attack.\n\nI think the key is that she was within her rights to be upset about his question and to call him out. However, her response of asking about his size might be seen as crossing a boundary herself. But considering that he brought up the topic first, maybe she's not entirely wrong. It's a bit of a tricky situation. The friends might be wrong for not understanding her perspective, but her method of response could be questionable. So, I'm torn. The user says she's in the wrong, but maybe the situation is not black and white. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and her response was to ask a personal question in return, which could be seen as retaliatory, maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the guy started it, so she's not at fault. Hmm.\n"
