Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where they asked a guy about his penis size after he asked about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The guy asked the author how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. He then made a comment implying she weighs more than him, which she took as a slight. She asked why he asked, and he justified it by saying it's okay for men to comment on women's weight but not the other way around. Then she turned the question back on him, asking about his penis size, which embarrassed him, and his friends called her an overreacting bitch.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's response was appropriate. Let's consider social norms. Weight can be a sensitive topic, especially for women. When the guy asked her weight, it was a personal question that might not be appropriate in a casual conversation. Then, when he made a comment about her weight compared to his, that crossed a line. His argument about a double standard is problematic because it's not fair to assume that all women are discriminatory based on weight, or that men can't be held accountable for their comments. \n\nWhen she asked him about his penis size, she was trying to show him the double standard he was pointing out. But using his insecurity in that way might be seen as exploiting his vulnerability. However, it's also a form of pointing out the hypocrisy he mentioned. \n\nHis friends criticized her for overreacting, but his initial comments were what started the tension. He didn't apologize for making her uncomfortable, which is a red flag. The author was trying to communicate her feelings and the impact of his words, which is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, asking about his penis size directly might be seen as confrontational. But given the context of his previous comments and the double standard he brought up, it could be a reasonable way to highlight the issue. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key here is that he initiated the personal and potentially hurtful conversation. \n\nSo, the author was within her rights to express her discomfort and to point out the hypocrisy. The guy's friends were wrong to call her the asshole, as the initial problem was his comments. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
