Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after a situation where a guy asked her weight, and she responded by asking about his penis size. \n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. Weight is a sensitive topic for many people, so that's understandable. When he asked, she hesitated but answered. Then he made a comment that she interprets as critical, saying she weighs more than him. She confronts him about it, and he justifies it by bringing up a double standard regarding height and weight. \n\nThen, knowing he's insecure about his penis size, she asks him how big it is. The friends later called her an overreacting bitch because she used his insecurity as a response. The key here is whether the author overstepped.\n\nAsking about someone's weight can be seen as intrusive, especially if it makes them uncomfortable. The guy's comment about her weight being \"ok\" but implying she's heavier than him might be dismissive. However, the author's retort about his penis size is a personal and potentially offensive question. Even though she was reacting to his prior question, it's a different level of privacy. \n\nPenis size is a very sensitive and intimate topic, similar to weight. By asking that, she might have escalated the situation. The friends' reaction suggests they see it as taking advantage of his insecurity. While the guy's initial question was inappropriate, the author's response could also be seen as crossing a boundary. The balance here is tricky. The guy started the personal questions, but the author's reply might be too much in return. So, the author might be in the wrong for responding with a question that's equally private and could be hurtful, even if it was meant to make him understand her perspective.\n"
