Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for responding to a guy's question about her weight by asking how big his dick is. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy asked her out on a date, and during small talk, he showed her a fitness post about a woman's deadlift. Then he asked her how much she weighs. She felt uncomfortable because weight can be a sensitive topic. When he asked, she answered, and then he said she weighs more than him, which made her feel like he was calling her fat. She got angry and asked him about the point of the question. He said he was just curious and made a comment about not being morbidly fat, which she found harsh. She then responded by asking about his dick size, which embarrassed him, and he didn't apologize. Now, her friends are saying she's an asshole for taking advantage of his insecurity.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal questions and the appropriateness of the response. The guy's question about her weight was personal and made her uncomfortable. She answered it, but his follow-up comment was dismissive and possibly insensitive. Then, she used his own insecurity (about his dick size) to mirror his behavior. The friends are criticizing her for this because they think she knew his insecurity and used it to retaliate, whereas he didn't know hers.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone's weight can be seen as intrusive, especially if it's a woman. Weight is a sensitive topic, and the guy's comment about her weighing more than him might have been a way to make himself feel better, which is a form of comparison that's not kind. When she responded with the question about his dick size, it's a personal and equally sensitive topic for many men. He didn't respond and asked her to stop, so he's uncomfortable with her question. The friends are upset because they think she's being hypocritical\u2014using his insecurity to make a point but not acknowledging that he didn't know about her sensitivity.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both topics (weight and dick size) are personal and can be sensitive. The guy initiated the personal question, and she reciprocated. However, the friends' argument is that he had a \"right\" to ask because he felt it was about something he could control (weight vs. height), whereas her question was about something he can't control. But that reasoning might be flawed because both are personal and can be sources of insecurity regardless of control.\n\nThe author's intention was to make the guy understand that his question was inappropriate by mirroring his behavior. Whether that's justified or not depends on perspective. If the guy's question was unkind and the author felt disrespected, then her reaction is a form of pointing out the hypocrisy. However, using a personal question to respond to a personal question might be seen as taking the exchange too far, especially in a group where others might not see the context. The fact that the friends labeled her as the asshole suggests there's a cultural or social norm in their group that prioritizes certain sensitivities over others. \n\nBut the author's discomfort was real, and the guy's follow-up comments were potentially harmful. By asking his question, she was trying to make him see that personal questions can be hurtful regardless of the topic. The problem here is that the guy didn't apologize, and the friends' backlash is based on the idea that she \"knew\" his insecurity, which they think makes her actions worse. However, the author didn't know about her own weight being a sensitive issue for the guy, but he didn't know hers. The friends' double standard might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were a response to being made to feel uncomfortable by the guy's personal question and his condescending remarks. Her intent was to highlight the inappropriateness of the exchange. While it's true that both topics can be sensitive, the initial question from the guy was the trigger, and her response was a form of self-defense to point out the hypocrisy. The friends' judgment seems to be based on an incorrect assumption that the guy's question was more acceptable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
