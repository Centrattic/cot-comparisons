Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a guy asked the author how much she weighed, which made her uncomfortable. She then responded by asking him about his dick size, leading to some back and forth, and her friends are now calling her the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy asked about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. He followed up by making a comment comparing her weight to his, which she found offensive. Then he criticized her for being too sensitive and brought up the idea of double standards regarding body insecurities. The author, in response, asked about his dick size to mirror his insecurity, which he found embarrassing. \n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and how each person handled the situation. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and his subsequent comments about her weight were hurtful. The author's reaction was to ask a similarly personal question about his body, which he didn't appreciate. \n\nBut wait, the guy started by asking about her weight, which is a topic that's often considered intrusive. His comments after she answered could be seen as judgmental. The author's response was to use his known insecurity against him, which might be a form of emotional manipulation. However, maybe she was trying to make him understand her perspective. \n\nThe friends are siding with the guy, saying she took advantage of his insecurity. But his friends might be biased if they tease him about his insecurities. The guy also brought up double standards, implying that it's okay for men to judge women's weight but not women to judge men's genital size. That's a problematic stance. \n\nIn terms of social norms, asking a woman about her weight is generally considered inappropriate, and the guy was in the wrong there first. The author's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was a reaction to his initial intrusion. However, using his insecurity as a weapon might not be the best approach. It could be seen as equally rude, even if she had a point. \n\nBut was she in the wrong? If the guy first broke the norm by asking about her weight and then made a judgmental comment, her response might be justified as a way to confront his behavior. However, using his specific insecurity might have been a bit of a low blow, even if she had a point. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had a right to set boundaries and push back against his behavior, then her response isn't entirely wrong. The friends' reaction that she's the asshole could be because they condone his behavior and find her standing up for herself as overreacting. \n\nSo, considering all this, the initial question was wrong from the guy. The author's response was her way of asserting her boundaries, but maybe she could have handled it differently. However, she wasn't in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable and trying to make him see her perspective. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
