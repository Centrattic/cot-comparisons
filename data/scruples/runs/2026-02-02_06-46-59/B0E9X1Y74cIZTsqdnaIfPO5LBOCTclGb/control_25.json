Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy asked her how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked him about his dick size to show him how it feels to be on the receiving end. The question is whether she was in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy asked her a personal question about her weight, which she found offensive. He followed up with a comment that she weighed more than him, which she interpreted as a negative remark. She then confronted him, and when he didn't apologize, she asked him about his dick size to mirror his behavior. \n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and reciprocity. Asking someone about their weight can be seen as intrusive, especially if it's not a mutual topic of discussion. The guy's comments about her weight being \"ok\" but not morbidly fat might have been dismissive and hurtful. The author's response was to ask about his dick size, which is also a personal and sensitive topic. \n\nThe friends in the group labeled her as the asshole because she used his insecurity against him. However, the initial question from the guy was the first transgression. By asking a personal question that made her uncomfortable, he set the dynamic where she felt justified in reciprocating with an equally personal question. \n\nBut does that mean she's in the wrong? Well, retaliation isn't always the best approach, but it's a form of showing empathy. If he was uncomfortable with her asking about his body, perhaps he shouldn't have asked her in the first place. The fact that he didn't apologize for his initial question might have led her to feel that he wasn't taking her feelings into account. \n\nHowever, asking someone about their genital size is a very sensitive and intimate question, which could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if it was a form of \"teaching a lesson,\" it's possible that her reaction was too harsh. But considering that the guy had already brought up her weight in an awkward manner, her response could be seen as a way to highlight the double standard in how personal questions are handled between genders.\n\nThe friends' reactions might be influenced by their own biases towards body insecurities. The guy's insecurity about his dick size might be why they think she overstepped, but the original issue was his question about her weight. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered rude to ask someone about their weight, so the guy was already in the wrong there. The author's response, while perhaps not the most mature, was a reaction to him not respecting her boundaries. However, using his insecurity as a tool to make a point might not be the healthiest approach, but it's a valid reaction to his initial transgression.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the guy started by asking a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She tried to address it, but he didn't apologize. Her asking about his dick size was a way to show him how his actions made her feel. While her method might be questionable, the initial wrong was his. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
