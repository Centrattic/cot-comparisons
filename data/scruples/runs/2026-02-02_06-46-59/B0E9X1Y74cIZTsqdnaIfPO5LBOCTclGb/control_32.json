Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after asking about the guy's dick size in response to him asking about her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight after a date, which she found uncomfortable. She felt he was implying she was fat when he said she weighs more than him. Then she confronted him, and he defended himself by talking about double standards regarding body image. The author then asked about his dick size, leading to embarrassment and friends calling her a bitch.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and respect in personal questions. The guy's question about her weight was invasive and made her uncomfortable. She had the right to express that discomfort. However, when she asked about his dick size, that's another personal topic. The guy was likely uncomfortable because that's a sensitive area for him. The friends' reaction suggests that they see her as the aggressor here because she used his insecurity against him.\n\nBut wait, the guy's initial question about her weight was the catalyst. She felt disrespected and tried to mirror his behavior. The issue is whether her response was a fair reaction. While it's valid to be upset about being asked a personal question, retaliating with another personal question might escalate things. However, if she was trying to show him the effect of his actions, maybe it's a form of tit-for-tat. But in many cases, using someone's insecurity against them can be seen as inconsiderate, even if they were the first to be inconsiderate. \n\nThe friends' judgment of her as an \"overreacting bitch\" might stem from cultural norms where guys asking about weight is more socially accepted than girls asking about penile size. But that doesn't make the guy's original question right. The author's right to set boundaries is valid, but the method might have been counterproductive. Still, she had the right to express her discomfort. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on whether using his insecurity was a justified response. If the goal was to make him understand her discomfort, it's a form of communication. But since he didn't apologize and the friends still side with him, maybe her approach wasn't the best. However, the initial question from him was the problem. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but her response might have been a bit harsh. But given the context, she was defending her own boundaries. So B (No) seems correct.\n"
