Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a specific interaction with a guy. \n\nFirst, the guy asked the author how much she weighs. Weight is a sensitive topic for many people, so that's a red flag right there. He then comments that she weighs more than him, which could be interpreted as a negative comment. The author feels uncomfortable and confronts him, which he responds by defending his question and bringing up a double standard about insecurities.\n\nThe key point here is the guy's initial question and his follow-up comment. Asking someone's weight is generally considered intrusive, especially in a dating context. Then, he adds a remark that could be seen as putting her down. The author's response was to ask about his insecurities regarding his own body (penis size), which the guy found embarrassing. \n\nThe friends in the group are labeling the author as the asshole because she used his insecurity against him. But the original problem started with him asking a personal question. The author's action was a form of retaliation, which might not be appropriate, but the root cause is the guy's inappropriate question and comment. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of retaliating with a personal question, she might have set a boundary without attacking his insecurities. But the guy's actions definitely contributed to the conflict. \n\nConsidering this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but her response could be seen as escalating the situation. However, the main issue is the guy's initial behavior. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as the primary responsibility lies with the guy for asking a personal and potentially hurtful question.\n"
