Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, there's this guy and a girl on a date. They're making small talk, and he shows her an Instagram post about a weightlifter. He comments on her weight and the amount she lifts, then asks the author how much she weighs. The author feels uncomfortable and answers, but then he says she weighs more than him. She gets upset and confronts him about why he asked. He defends himself, saying it's just a question and brings up double standards about how guys can't help things like height but can help weight. The author then asks him about the size of his... you know, which makes him embarrassed. After that, his friends call her an overreacting bitch because she knew about his insecurity and used it against him.\n\nHmm. Let's see. First, the guy asked a personal question about her weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and it's common for people to feel uncomfortable with that. Then he made a comment that she interpreted as him implying she's fat. His response was dismissive, and he brought up double standards, which might not be the best approach. The author then asked a personal question back, which is about his anatomy, which he found embarrassing. The friends are saying she used his insecurity against him, which makes them think she's the asshole.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the guy initiated the personal question. He asked her weight, which she felt was intrusive. Then he made a comment that made her uncomfortable. She responded by asking a similar personal question about him, which he didn't appreciate. But the key point is that he started it. She was defending her feelings by using his own insecurity as a way to show him how it feels. However, maybe her approach was a bit of a tit-for-tat. But considering that he brought up a sensitive topic first, and then she responded in kind, which he found embarrassing. His friends are calling her the asshole because she used his insecurity against him. But maybe they're not considering that he was the one who started the personal questions. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she felt his question was inappropriate and wanted to show him how it feels to be asked something personal, maybe that's a way to teach a lesson. However, it's a bit of a harsh reaction. But the initial issue was his question and comments. I think she's not in the wrong because he started the personal questions and then got upset when she reciprocated. The friends are probably not seeing the context correctly. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
