Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details.\n\nSo, there's a guy who asked the author on a date. After the date, they're making small talk. He shows her an Instagram post about a female weightlifter and comments on her weight. Then he asks the author how much she weighs. She's uncomfortable but answers. He then says she weighs more than him, which makes her angry. She confronts him, he says it's just a question and brings up double standards about how women are sensitive. She then asks him about his dick size to mirror his behavior, which makes him embarrassed. He doesn't apologize. Later, her friends call her an overreacting bitch because she used his insecurity about his dick to make a point. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man asked a personal question about her weight, which she found uncomfortable. Then he made a comment implying she's fat, even if he didn't mean it that way. She tried to set boundaries by confronting him, but then escalated by asking about his dick size, which she knew he's insecure about. Her friends argue that she took advantage of his insecurities, leading her to be labeled as the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether her response (asking about his dick size) was appropriate. On one hand, he asked a personal question about her weight, which she found offensive. On the other hand, she retaliated by asking about another personal topic he's insecure about. The friends' reaction suggests that they see her as the aggressor here. \n\nI need to consider the context of the conversation. The guy's initial question was about her weight, which is a sensitive topic. He then made a comment that came off as judgmental. The author felt it was necessary to confront him, which is a valid response to feeling disrespected. However, using his own insecurity against him might be seen as a form of tit-for-tat behavior. \n\nThere's a double standard here. The guy didn't apologize and instead made excuses, talking about double standards regarding height and weight. The author tried to mirror his actions to show the problem, but maybe she went too far by bringing up his specific insecurity. \n\nThe key question is whether her response was justified. She had a right to feel uncomfortable and to set boundaries. However, retaliating with a personal question about his body, which he's already insecure about, could be seen as using his vulnerability. Even if her intention was to make a point about the double standard, the method might have been inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the friends' reaction is important. They don't see her action as justified and label her as the problem. This might indicate a cultural or social context where such personal questions are considered a form of teasing or bonding among the group, but the author's response was out of line. \n\nIn conclusion, while the guy's initial questions were inappropriate and contributed to the problem, the author's response might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. She had the right to express her discomfort, but using his insecurity as a weapon could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not handling it differently, even if her intent was to highlight the issue.\n"
