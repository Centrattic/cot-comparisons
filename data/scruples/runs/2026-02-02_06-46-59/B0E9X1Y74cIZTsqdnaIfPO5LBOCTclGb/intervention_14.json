Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy asking the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable, and then she asked him about his penis size as a way to show him her perspective. The guy didn't apologize, and her friends called her a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable. She felt he was being critical of her weight, even if he didn't mean it that way. She responded by asking a similarly personal question about his insecurities, which he found embarrassing. Her friends think she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him when he didn't know about hers.\n\nEthically, both sides might have some issues. The guy asked a sensitive question without considering her feelings, which isn't great. He made a comment about her weight that came off as judgmental, even if he didn't intend it. But then the author took it further by asking a personal question about him, which he found offensive. That could be seen as using his insecurity as a weapon, which is manipulative.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The guy shouldn't have made her feel uncomfortable by asking about her weight in a way that felt critical. However, the author's response might have been a form of retaliation, using his known insecurity to highlight her point, which isn't the healthiest approach. She could have addressed his comment directly without bringing up his personal insecurities, which he didn't know he had. \n\nHer friends are right in pointing out that she knew about his insecurity and used it against him. Even if her intention was to teach him a lesson about how it feels to be asked personal questions, doing so in that context might cross a line. It's not just about the act of asking but the context and intent. By using his insecurity, she put him in a vulnerable position, which might be why the friends think she's at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial behavior was problematic. He should have been more considerate of her feelings when asking about her weight. But the author's response might have escalated the situation by leveraging his personal vulnerabilities. So, while both parties have some responsibility, the author's action might be seen as more in the wrong because she crossed into his personal insecurities intentionally, even if he didn't know about them.\n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation. The main reason is that she used his known insecurity as a form of retaliation without considering that he wasn't aware of how sensitive she was about her weight. While the guy's initial question was inappropriate, her response might have been more hurtful because it targeted his insecurities directly.\n"
