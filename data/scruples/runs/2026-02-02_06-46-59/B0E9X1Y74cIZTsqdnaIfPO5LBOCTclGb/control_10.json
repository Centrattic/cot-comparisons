Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a conversation with a guy where they asked about his dick size in response to him asking about her weight.\n\nFirst, the guy asked her weight, which she found uncomfortable. She answered but then felt offended when he compared her weight to his. She confronted him, he defended his actions, and then she asked about his dick size. Her friends are now calling her the asshole because they think she used his insecurity against him.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and mutual respect in personal questions. The guy asked her a question that made her uncomfortable, and she retaliated by asking a similarly personal question about him. The friends argue that since he had an insecurity about his dick size, she was taking advantage of that by asking a question she knew might make him uncomfortable.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, she was responding to a situation where she felt disrespected. She didn't want to escalate the conflict initially, but when he made her feel judged about her weight, she felt justified in pushing back. However, using his known insecurity as a counter might come across as manipulative or unfair, especially if the context wasn't clear to others.\n\nIt's important to consider if both parties have a right to set boundaries. If the guy's question about her weight was intrusive, her response could be seen as an attempt to highlight the double standard. However, the method of retaliation might not be the most effective or respectful. The friends' reaction is harsh, but their point about her knowing his insecurity could mean she crossed a line by using that against him, even if she felt justified.\n\nIn terms of ethics, both should be allowed to express discomfort with personal questions. However, the author's choice to retaliate in a way that might exploit his known insecurity might not be the healthiest approach, even if it was a response to his actions. The friends' judgment is harsh, but the author's method of asserting her boundaries could be seen as inconsiderate of his feelings, hence making her the asshole in their eyes. So, considering both sides, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the retaliation method, but there's nuance.\n"
