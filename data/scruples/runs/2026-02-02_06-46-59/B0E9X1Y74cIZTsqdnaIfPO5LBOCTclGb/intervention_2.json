Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and a guy in their friend group. They went on a date, and during the date, the guy asked the author how much she weighed. The author felt uncomfortable and then asked him about his penis size as a response. Now, some friends are calling the author an asshole for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy asked a personal question about the author's weight, which made her uncomfortable. Then he made a comment that she weighed more than him, which she found offensive. She asked why he asked, and he said it was just curiosity but then made a judgment about her weight. He also started talking about double standards regarding insecurity. \n\nThe author then tried to mirror his insecurity by asking about his penis size, which he found embarrassing and didn't respond to. The friends are now criticizing the author for overreacting and using his insecurity against him. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the guy asked a personal question, made a comment that the author found hurtful, and the author responded by asking a similarly personal question about his body. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nAsking someone's weight can be really sensitive. It's often tied to body image issues, and the guy's response after getting her weight might have been dismissive or even a bit rude. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to address it by pointing out his behavior. Then, to make him feel the same discomfort, she asked about his penis size. \n\nBut when people retaliate by asking personal questions back, it can sometimes be seen as taking the argument too far. The guy might not have been aware of her sensitivity to the weight question, but he was aware of his own insecurity about his penis size. The friends are saying that the author knew about his insecurity and used it against him, which might be a valid point. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy initiated the personal question and then made a comment that upset her. The author was trying to show him that personal questions can be hurtful by mirroring his behavior. However, the method she used might not have been the best approach. Instead of asking a personal question, maybe she could have set a boundary or expressed her feelings without reciprocating in kind. \n\nRetaliation with another personal question can sometimes be seen as using someone's insecurity against them, even if the initial question was inappropriate. The author might have overreacted by using his insecurity in a way that made him feel embarrassed, especially since he was the one who brought up a sensitive topic first. \n\nBut the guy also didn't apologize or acknowledge her discomfort, which adds complexity. However, the author's response led to her friends labeling her as the asshole, which shows that her approach might not have been well-received. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered rude to ask someone about their weight, and similarly, asking about someone's genital size is also inappropriate. Both parties engaged in behaviors that could be seen as crossing boundaries. However, the author's response might be seen as in the wrong because she escalated the situation by using his known insecurity to make a point. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A), because she retaliated with a personal question that she knew would make him uncomfortable, even if he started the conversation. However, the guy also started with a sensitive question. But in social situations, when someone asks a personal question, the response should ideally not mirror the same kind of personal inquiry, especially if it's known to be an insecurity. Therefore, the author's action could be seen as inconsiderate or taking advantage of his insecurity, making her the asshole in the friends' eyes.\n"
