Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy asked how much she weighs, which made her uncomfortable. Then he made a comment about her weighing more than him, which she took as an insult. She then asked about his penis size to mirror his insecurity, and he got embarrassed. The friends are saying she's the asshole because she used his insecurity against him, even though she didn't know he was insecure about his weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Asking someone's weight is generally considered a personal question and can be sensitive. The guy initiated the conversation by asking her weight, which she found offensive. She responded by asking about his penis size, which is also a personal and potentially sensitive topic. The key point is whether her response was appropriate given the context.\n\nThe guy's argument is that he was \"just curious\" and that there's a double standard because men feel they can discuss women's weight. However, using someone's insecurity to point out their own (like asking about his penis size) might be seen as manipulative. But the friends are saying she exploited his known insecurity, which she was aware of from their friend group's teasing. If she knew he was insecure about that, then using it as a counter might be seen as taking advantage of his vulnerability.\n\nOn the other hand, the initial question about her weight was inappropriate, and her response was a direct and personal way to make him feel the same discomfort. It's a form of tit-for-tat. Whether that's justified depends on whether the initial question was wrong. If the guy overstepped by asking about her weight, then her response could be seen as a reasonable reaction to his transgression. However, if she knew his insecurity beforehand, her question might be seen as using that against him, especially if she didn't have the same expectation for him to be sensitive about her weight.\n\nAnother angle is that she tried to make him see her perspective by putting him in a similar situation. It's a common tactic to use the other person's own behavior to highlight the issue. But if it's done in a way that's hurtful, even if the initial action was wrong, it might not be the best approach. However, the guy didn't apologize, which shows he didn't acknowledge her discomfort, so perhaps her response was a way to enforce boundaries.\n\nThe friends' reaction labels her as the asshole because they see the exchange as her exploiting his known insecurity. They might not consider the initial question as problematic, hence her reaction is seen as overstepping. But in reality, the initial question was the trigger, so her response was a defensive measure.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the guy's question was inappropriate, then her response, while personal, is a valid way to show him the impact of his words. However, if the friends are right that she took advantage of his known insecurity (which she was aware of), then she might be in the wrong for using that to get her point across.\n\nBut the key here is that the guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, and then made a comment she perceived as offensive. Her response was a direct consequence to mirror his behavior. Since the friends are focusing on the fact that she knew his insecurity, but not that he initiated the inappropriate question, it's possible that the friends are missing the initial transgression.\n\nIn terms of social norms, asking someone's weight is often seen as rude, and responding with a question about body size in return is a way to address that. However, using a different part of the body (penis size) might be seen as more personal or even inappropriate. But if the guy was the one who started the conversation about body-related insecurities, then her response is just pointing out the double standard.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because she was responding to his initial offensive question. However, the way she addressed it might be seen as manipulative. But given that he didn't apologize and continued to defend his actions, her response could be justified as setting boundaries. The friends' judgment seems to be missing the initial fault of the guy. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
