Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy asking the author about her weight, which made her uncomfortable. She then asked about his penis size as a way to make him understand her perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around personal questions. Asking someone's weight is often seen as intrusive because body image is a sensitive topic for many. The guy's question came up after he was talking about a female weightlifter, which might imply he was comparing her to the author. His comment about her weight being \"ok\" and the double standard he mentioned could be part of justifying his question. However, making a comment about someone's weight can be hurtful regardless of intent.\n\nThe author's response was to ask about his penis size. This is a personal question too, but she did so in the context of trying to make him understand her discomfort. The friends criticized her for using his insecurity. But does that make her wrong? Maybe she overstepped by making it a direct comparison, but her intent was to highlight the double standard he pointed out. \n\nThe guy didn't apologize, and the friends blamed her for being sensitive. However, the initial question from the guy was the starting point. People have different sensitivities, and it's reasonable for someone to feel uncomfortable. The friends' judgment that she's in the wrong because she knew his insecurity might not account for the fact that he initiated the personal question without considering her feelings. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both parties might have acted in a way that could be critiqued, but the key point is whether the author was in the wrong. The guy asked a personal question that made her uncomfortable, which she had a right to address. Using his own insecurity to mirror his behavior could be seen as a valid form of pointing out hypocrisy, even if it's not the most constructive approach. So, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong (B), but it's a bit nuanced. However, based on the details, the author's reaction was a response to his initial intrusion, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
