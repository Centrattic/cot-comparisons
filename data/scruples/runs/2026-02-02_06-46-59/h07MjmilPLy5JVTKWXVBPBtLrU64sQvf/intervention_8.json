Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper when their husband came home.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and using pull-ups. The author forgot to change her diaper after the husband wrestled with her. The husband got angry, saying she left the diaper for 5 hours (which she denies) and that he was covered in pee. The author mentions it was a stressful day and she was making dinner when she forgot. She asked him to change the diaper, but he reacted angrily. Now they're arguing, and the author is feeling defensive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are: the author forgot to change the diaper, which led to the daughter's clothes being wet. The husband was upset, and the author says it wasn't her usual behavior. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's false. She was in the middle of making dinner when she realized. She asked him to change it, but he reacted angrily. The author left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgetting to change a diaper isn't typically a major issue unless there's a pattern. The daughter is 2.5 and using pull-ups, which are meant for occasional use. If the author is usually diligent but had a stressful day and lost track of time, maybe it's understandable. But the husband's reaction might be over the top. However, the author did forget, which could be seen as neglectful. But the husband might have taken it as a personal attack, especially if he felt he had to clean up. The author says the husband was yelling, but he denies it. The author left the room to avoid conflict, which isn't ideal, but maybe it's because the situation is stressful.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Maybe not entirely. It's a common parenting stress point. However, the author did forget, which could be seen as a mistake. But if it's a one-time thing and not a pattern, the husband's reaction might be excessive. The author isn't in the wrong if it's an isolated incident. The husband's reaction might be the issue here. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
