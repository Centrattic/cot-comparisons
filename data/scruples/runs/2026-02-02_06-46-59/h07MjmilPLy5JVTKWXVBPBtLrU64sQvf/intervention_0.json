Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, and the husband getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's using pull-ups. The parent was making dinner when her husband got home. The mom forgot to change the diaper, and when she realized, she asked the husband to do it. After he did, he got angry, saying she left it on for 5 hours, which she denies. He was upset because her clothes were wet, and he felt disrespected because he was covered in pee. The mom says it's not something that happens often, and that it was a stressful day. She left because she didn't want to argue.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the mom is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Forgetting to change a diaper for a toddler isn't ideal, but it's a common parenting mistake. Since it's a rare occurrence, maybe it's understandable. The mom was in the middle of cooking dinner, which is a valid distraction. However, she did ask her husband to help, so maybe she took responsibility once she realized the mistake. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit harsh. Yelling and throwing things isn't acceptable. He's upset about being covered in pee, but that's part of parenting. The mom left because she didn't want to argue, which might indicate that the conflict is more about communication than the actual incident. \n\nThe key factors here are intent and frequency. The mom didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was a forgetful moment during a busy time. The husband's reaction (overstating the time and yelling) seems disproportionate. However, the mom could have been more proactive in changing the diaper even while cooking. Maybe she could have set a reminder or asked for help sooner. \n\nOn the other hand, expecting a parent to never make such a mistake is unrealistic. The fact that it's a one-time thing and she's usually responsible might tip the scale. The husband should handle the situation calmly and supportively instead of escalating into an argument. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mom isn't necessarily in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
