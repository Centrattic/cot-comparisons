Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is the asshole for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the mother forgot to change her 2.5-year-old's pull-up, which leaked, and the husband got angry when he had to change her. The mother says it's not something that happens often, and she was stressed while making dinner. The husband claims she left it on for 5 hours and felt disrespected because he got covered in pee. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities. Both parents usually share responsibilities. The mother was in the middle of cooking, but a child's needs should take priority. Even if she was busy, a toddler in a pull-up that's supposed to be changed regularly\u2014especially if it's causing leakage\u2014should be addressed promptly. Forgetting entirely might be a slip-up, but it's something that could be prevented with routine.\n\nThe husband's reaction is another point. He got angry, threw something, and was upset. While being covered in pee is unpleasant, his anger might be excessive if it's a one-time mistake. However, if the mother is usually responsible, this might have been a bigger deal for him. The key here is whether the mother's action was negligent. Since the daughter is 2.5, they should be using training pants, and regular bathroom breaks should be part of the routine. Missing that could be seen as not prioritizing the child's needs, but the mother's reason was stress and being preoccupied.\n\nThe question is about whether the mother is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether neglecting a child's basic needs is considered wrong. If the mother usually takes care of it and this was a rare mistake due to stress, maybe it's understandable. However, if it's a recurring issue or she's dismissive of her child's needs, that's different. Here, the mother says it doesn't happen ever, so it's a one-time error. Still, a 2.5-year-old should be able to use the potty or at least have their pull-up changed before it leaks. The mother's excuse is that she was cooking, but that's a common parent task. The husband's reaction is harsh, but the mother might not be entirely blameless if she didn't check on the child regularly.\n\nIn terms of the husband's anger, he might have overreacted, but the mother's oversight could be considered a mistake that led to the situation. The key is whether the mother was negligent. If she usually is responsible, a single slip-up due to stress isn't the end of the world. However, the fact that she didn't even check on the child until after the leak might indicate a lack of attention. The husband's frustration is understandable if he's already dealing with the mess, but yelling and anger over a one-time mistake could be excessive. \n\nIn summary, the mother made an error, but it's a human error. The husband's reaction seems out of proportion. The mother isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake, especially if it's rare. So the answer would be B, not the asshole.\n"
