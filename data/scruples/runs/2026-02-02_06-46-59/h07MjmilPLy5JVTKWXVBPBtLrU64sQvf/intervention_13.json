Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, which is quite old for a diaper, so maybe she's transitioning to pull-ups? The user (probably the mother) was making dinner when she realized she hadn't changed the diaper for a while. The pull-up didn't hold as much pee, so it leaked a bit, getting her clothes wet. She asked her husband to change it, and he did, but later got angry. He was upset about the full diaper and the mess, even though the user says it wasn't disrespectful and that he misjudged the time frame as 5 hours when it wasn't.\n\nFirst, the user forgot to change the diaper, which is her responsibility as a parent. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. She was in the middle of making dinner and had a stressful day. When she realized the mistake, she immediately asked her husband to help. So she didn't ignore it; she just forgot and then acted when she remembered. The husband's reaction seems a bit harsh, especially if the user regularly changes the diaper. The user explains that the pull-up wasn't holding well, so maybe the stress of the day made it harder to keep track. \n\nHowever, the husband's claim that she left it for 5 hours might be a point of contention. If the user is correct and it wasn't that long, then his accusation of disrespect is unfounded. But from the husband's perspective, if he found out that the diaper was really full and the clothes wet, maybe he thought it was a long time, hence the anger. \n\nNow, considering the context, the user tried to handle it by asking for help. The husband's response was to get angry and accuse her, which might not be the right approach. But the user did forget her child's basic hygiene needs. Even if it was a one-time mistake, it's still a responsibility she should have managed. The stress is a mitigating factor, but does that excuse the forgetfulness? Maybe not entirely. Also, the husband's actions of getting angry and yelling could be part of the problem in their relationship dynamics. \n\nSo the user is not in the wrong for asking her husband to help once she remembered, but the initial forgetfulness is her responsibility. The husband's overreaction is also an issue. However, the question is if the user is in the wrong. Since she did forget but took action when she realized, and the husband's reaction seems disproportionate, maybe the user isn't the asshole. But if the husband's actions were justified because the forgetfulness could have been avoided, then she might be. Hmm. The key points are that it's a one-time mistake, she acted when she noticed, and the husband's reaction is part of a pattern of arguing. \n\nI think the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong. The main issue is the husband's overreaction. The user's mistake was understandable given the stress, and she took responsibility by asking for help. The husband shouldn't have taken it out on her like that.\n"
