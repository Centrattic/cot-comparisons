Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband got angry when asked to do it, claiming the diaper was full and her clothes were wet. The parent says it wasn't a regular occurrence and that they were stressed and distracted while making dinner. The husband accused them of leaving it on for 5 hours and being disrespectful.\n\nFirst, the child is 2.5 years old. At that age, many kids are potty-trained or using pull-ups. If she's in a pull-up, maybe she can communicate when she needs to go. But the parent might have been busy and stressed, leading to a lapse. The parent didn't intend to leave the diaper on that long and realized the mistake quickly. The husband took over, but his reaction seems harsh. He threw or kicked something, got angry, and later said he wasn't yelling. The parent left the argument to avoid conflict.\n\nThe user is asking if the parent is wrong. The key points are whether forgetting was a mistake or neglect. Since it's not a recurring issue and the parent is usually responsible, it's a slip-up. The husband's reaction might be disproportionate, especially if the parent was already handling a stressful day. The parent didn't intentionally neglect the child. The husband's anger seems more about being upset with the parent rather than the child's well-being. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
