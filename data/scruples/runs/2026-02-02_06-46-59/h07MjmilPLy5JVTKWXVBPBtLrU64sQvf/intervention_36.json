Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe daughter is 2.5 years old, wearing a pull-up. The husband came home while the author was making dinner. The author realized they forgot to change the diaper, which had a lot of pee in it, and asked the husband to change it. The husband got angry, saying the author didn't have an excuse, and there was some yelling. The author left to avoid an argument. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the author disputes that. The stress of the day made them lose track of time.\n\nHmm. So first, is the author at fault for not changing the diaper? Well, the child is 2.5, so maybe they're potty training? But pull-ups are used for kids who aren't fully trained yet. The author usually changes the diaper regularly. This was an exception because of a stressful day. The author was in the middle of cooking dinner when they realized the oversight.\n\nBut the husband took over and got angry. The author asked him to change the diaper, which is a reasonable request. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling, throwing things, making it about being covered in pee. The author left to avoid conflict. \n\nSo the author's mistake might be not realizing the urgency earlier, but given the stress and that this is a rare occurrence, maybe it's understandable. The husband's response seems more about the conflict than the actual situation. The author tried to explain but was cut off. The husband's claim about 5 hours might be an exaggeration. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They made a mistake but in a stressful situation. The husband's reaction is more about the conflict than the actual issue. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong), because it's a one-time slip-up due to stress, and the husband's response was disproportionate. But I'm not sure. Maybe the author should have prioritized changing the diaper over dinner? But they were in the middle of cooking. It's a balance. The key is whether the author's mistake was significant enough to justify the husband's anger. Since it's a rare occurrence and due to stress, maybe not. So B.\n"
