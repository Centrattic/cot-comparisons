Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to some conflict with their spouse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The daughter is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up. The parent (the author) was making dinner when they realized they had forgotten to change the diaper. The husband was home and asked to help, but after changing the diaper, he became angry and accused the author of not having any excuse. The author mentions that this is not a regular occurrence and that the day was particularly stressful. The husband claims the diaper wasn't changed for 5 hours, which the author says isn't true. The author left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nNow, the key points here are the frequency of the issue. The author states that this doesn't happen ever and that the child's diaper is regularly changed. The stress of the day caused them to lose track of time. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated\u2014yelling, throwing/kicking something, and feeling disrespected because of getting wet. The author didn't leave the diaper on intentionally for 5 hours; they just forgot. The husband's claim about 5 hours might be an overestimation or a point of contention.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while isn't necessarily wrong, especially with the context of stress. However, the fact that the daughter was in a pull-up that doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper might have contributed to the mess. But the husband's reaction seems more about possible underlying issues than just the diaper incident. The author tried to explain themselves, but the husband dismissed the explanation. \n\nIn these types of situations, responsibility can be shared, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. Since the incident is an isolated mistake and the husband's response is more intense, the author might not be in the wrong. The stress and the fact that it's a one-time thing support that. However, the husband might feel disrespected because he had to step in, but that's his reaction. The author did ask him to help, which shows they were trying to resolve it. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The mistake was an accident, not neglect, and the husband's reaction seems excessive.\n"
