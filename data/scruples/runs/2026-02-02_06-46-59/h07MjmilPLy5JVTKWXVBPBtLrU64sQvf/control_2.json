Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their toddler's diaper, which then leads to the husband changing the diaper and getting upset.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was wearing a pull-up. The parent (the author) forgot to change her diaper because they were making dinner, and the husband offered to help but got angry. The key points here are that the child's diaper wasn't changed as usual, leading to a wet situation. The husband is upset, saying she left the child for 5 hours, which the author denies. The stress of the day and time management come into play.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Did they intentionally neglect the child? The author mentions it's not something that happens ever, and it was a stressful day where they lost track of time. The husband was in the house and could have helped earlier, but the author asked him to change the diaper after realizing. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially since the child's regular routine was disrupted once. The argument over a wet diaper and the husband feeling \"disrespected\" because he got wet might be overreacting. \n\nAlso, the husband's claim about 5 hours might be exaggerated. The author was in the middle of dinner, which is a time when multitasking might be harder, especially with a toddler. The husband could have been more understanding or offered help earlier. The fact that the author left to avoid arguing suggests the dynamics might be tense, but the main issue is whether the oversight was intentional or neglectful. Since the author didn't mean to harm or neglect, and it's an isolated incident due to stress, it's more likely the husband is overreacting. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
