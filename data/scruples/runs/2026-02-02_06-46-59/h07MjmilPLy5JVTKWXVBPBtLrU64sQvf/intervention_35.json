Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, which is a time when kids are usually out of diapers and using pull-ups. The parent forgot to change the diaper because they were making dinner, and the husband ended up changing it but got angry.\n\nFirst, the parent admitted it was a one-time mistake due to a stressful day and being occupied with dinner. They didn't neglect the child on purpose. The husband claims it was a 5-hour period, but the parent says that's not true. The parent left the child in the pull-up for a while, but it's not a regular occurrence. The husband got upset because he felt disrespected, as he mentioned being covered in pee. However, the parent was trying to manage dinner, which is a common household task.\n\nThe key points here are intent and frequency. The parent didn't have malicious intent; it was a lapse due to being busy and stressed. It's also emphasized that this isn't a recurring issue. The husband's reaction seems harsh given that it's a one-off and that the parent had a valid reason. The parent tried to ask the husband for help, which shows they were trying to resolve it but the situation escalated. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't in the wrong. The mistake was understandable and not intentional. The husband's anger over a single incident, especially when the parent is also managing household duties, seems excessive. Therefore, the answer should be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
