Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent forgot to change her diaper because they were making dinner. The husband came home, they asked him to change the diaper, and he got angry. The parent says it didn't happen that long, but the husband claims it was 5 hours and that the parent is disrespectful. The parent left because they don't want to argue.\n\nSo, the key points: The parent forgot once, which is unusual. The husband took over, but his reaction was anger, which the parent found yelling. The parent left to avoid conflict. The husband is upset about being covered in pee and thinks the parent didn't have an excuse.\n\nFrom the parent's side, they mention it's not a regular occurrence and that the day was stressful. They were in the middle of cooking. But on the other hand, caring for a young child includes timely diaper changes. Even if it's a one-time slip, the parent might be held responsible for their child's basic needs. However, the husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The parent didn't intentionally leave the diaper for 5 hours; the husband's exaggeration might be part of the issue. Also, the parent's choice to step aside rather than argue could be seen as avoiding conflict, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent forgot, which is a mistake, but not necessarily malicious. The husband's reaction is problematic too. The parent might not be in the wrong because it's a single incident, stress made it happen, and the husband's response was harsh. So maybe the parent isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
