Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using a pull-up, and the situation happened while the mother was cooking dinner. The husband was home and got angry when he found out, even throwing or kicking something.\n\nFirst, the key points: The mother forgot to change the diaper because of a stressful day and being busy with dinner. The husband was asked to change it but was upset because the diaper was full and the kid's clothes were wet. He claims she left it for 5 hours (which she denies) and that it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The mother usually takes care of diaper changes, but in this case, she forgot. She asked the husband to do it, which he did. But his reaction seems extreme. The mother didn't mean any harm; it was a mistake due to stress. The husband's anger might stem from feeling attacked or maybe stress too, but his actions (throwing/kicking) and yelling are problematic. \n\nThe daughter is 2.5, so she's past the typical diaper stage but might still need occasional changes, especially if using pull-ups. However, the mother's forgetfulness here is a mistake, but not a malicious one. The husband's reaction is what's really in question here. He's the one who got angry, escalated the situation, and didn't handle it calmly. \n\nThe mother left the situation to avoid argument, which shows she didn't want conflict. The husband's claim that it was disrespectful is questionable because asking for help isn't disrespectful. The father was the one who took over the task, so the mess was on him, not her. \n\nSo, the mother made a mistake, but the husband's response was more toxic. The mother isn't in the wrong for a one-time oversight, especially with a valid reason (stressful day). The real issue is the husband's overreaction and his behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
