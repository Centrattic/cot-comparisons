Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong for not changing her daughter's diaper. The key points are:\n\n1. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much urine.\n2. The mother forgot, possibly due to a stressful day while cooking dinner.\n3. The husband asked to change the diaper, but then got angry because the diaper was full and the child's clothes were wet. He claims it took 5 hours, which the mother denies.\n4. The husband was upset about being covered in pee and yelled, but the mother left to avoid arguing.\n\nFirst, the mother forgetting once in a while isn't a big deal, especially since she usually takes care of it. Stress can affect anyone. The child being in a pull-up that doesn't hold as well makes sense why the situation happened. The husband's reaction seems harsh over a one-time incident. He had the chance to change the diaper when he offered but got angry instead. The mother left to avoid an argument, which is a common issue in their relationship. The husband's claim of 5 hours being disrespectful might be an exaggeration. The mother isn't in the wrong here; it's a minor mistake with a disproportionate reaction from the husband. So the answer is B.\n"
