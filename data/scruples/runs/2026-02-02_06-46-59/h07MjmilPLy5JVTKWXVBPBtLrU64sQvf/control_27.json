Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The husband came home, and the mom asked him to change the diaper but later realized she had forgotten. The husband got angry because the diaper was full and the kid's clothes were wet. The mom says it wasn't a big deal and that he was overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom says this is not typical. She usually changes the diaper regularly. The day was stressful, and she lost track of time while making dinner. So maybe the stress caused the oversight. The daughter is old enough for pull-ups, which might mean she's supposed to be potty training, so maybe missing a change isn't as bad as if she were younger. But 5 hours is a long time, and the husband thought that's how long she was in it. The mom says that's not true, but the husband is upset because he got covered in pee. \n\nNow, looking at their interaction: the mom asked him to change the diaper, which he did, but then he got angry. She felt he was yelling, he says he wasn't. She left the room because they argue a lot. The key here is whether the mom was negligent. If she's usually on top of things and this was an exception due to stress, maybe it's understandable. But the husband could have handled it differently instead of getting angry. \n\nThe question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Did she have a responsibility to change the diaper and failed, causing a mess? Well, she did ask her husband to help, so she wasn't ignoring it entirely. The problem is that the timing was bad for her, but she did intend to change it once she realized. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if the duration wasn't as long as he claimed. \n\nAlso, the husband's claim that it was disrespectful because he was covered in pee. Is that a valid reason to be angry? Maybe he felt disrespected because of the mess, but the mom didn't mean to make a mess. The stress of the day might have contributed. \n\nIn terms of shared responsibilities, both parents are supposed to help with children. The mom was in the middle of making dinner, which is a common task. Asking her husband to help is reasonable. The husband could have helped without getting angry. The mom isn't in the wrong for one mistake, especially since it's not a recurring issue. The husband's overreaction is the problem here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the situation was a one-time stress-related oversight, and the husband's reaction was disproportionate.\n"
