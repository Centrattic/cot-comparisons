Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their toddler's diaper, leading to some conflict with their husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's probably starting to use pull-ups. The key points here are that the mother forgot to change her diaper for a while, but she realized it and asked her husband to help. The husband then got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she claims isn't true) and was upset about getting covered in pee.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if the mother is in the wrong. Let's consider the facts. The mother usually changes the diaper regularly, but yesterday was a stressful day with a lot going on. She was in the middle of making dinner when she realized she'd forgotten. She asked her husband for help, which shows she wasn't neglectful but had a lapse due to stress.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems disproportionate. He's angry over a wet diaper, which is a common issue with toddlers. The mother isn't doing this on purpose; it was an oversight. The husband claimed she left it for 5 hours, but the mother says that's not true. The husband also felt disrespected because he got covered in pee. However, the responsibility of changing a diaper is shared, and asking for help isn't a fault. The husband's anger and the escalation to yelling and throwing things indicate his own issues with handling stress or conflict.\n\nIn terms of parental duties, both parents share responsibilities. The mother didn't ignore it; she took action as soon as she realized. The husband's reaction seems more about his own frustration than the actual mistake. The mother's decision to leave the room to avoid arguing shows she's trying to de-escalate the situation, which is a mature response.\n\nConsidering all this, the mother isn't in the wrong. The main issue lies with the husband's overreaction and the way he handled the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
