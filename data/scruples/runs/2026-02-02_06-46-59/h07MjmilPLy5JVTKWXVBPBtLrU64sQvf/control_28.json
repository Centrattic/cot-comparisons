Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing her daughter's diaper. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was wearing a pull-up. The mother forgot to change her, and the husband ended up changing her but got upset. The mother admits it was a stressful day and she lost track of time while making dinner. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours (which she says isn't true) and felt disrespected because he got covered in pee.\n\nSo, the main points: Did the mother make a mistake? Probably, forgetting to change a diaper, even with a pull-up, can lead to wetness. But the key is context. The user mentions this is unusual and the daughter's diaper is usually changed regularly. The stress of the day might have contributed. \n\nThen, the husband's reaction: he got angry, threw something, and accused her of disrespect. The mother felt he was yelling, but he says he wasn't. Their communication seems strained. \n\nIs the mother in the wrong? She forgot, but it's a one-time incident and not a pattern. The husband's reaction might be over-the-top. The mother did ask him to help, which is sharing responsibilities. The husband's claim of 5 hours isn't accurate according to her. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the mother made a mistake but it's not a pattern. The husband's response seems harsh. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
