Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups which don't hold as much pee as regular diapers. The mother forgot to change her diaper for a while. She was making dinner when her husband came home. She asked him to change the diaper, but he got angry because when he did, the diaper was really full and her clothes were wet. The husband claims she left it on for 5 hours, which she denies. The mother says it was a stressful day and she lost track of time. The argument escalated, and now the husband is upset.\n\nSo, is the mother at fault? Well, 2.5-year-olds still need diaper changes, even if they're using pull-ups. The mother forgot, which could be due to stress or being busy with dinner. But she did ask her husband to help when she realized. However, the husband's reaction seems to be the bigger issue here. He's angry about a wet diaper and getting covered in pee, which seems disproportionate. The mother didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was a momentary lapse. On the other hand, the husband might feel that it's part of shared responsibility. But the fact that this is not a regular occurrence and the husband overreacted might point to him being the problem.\n\nThe key points are: the mother forgot once due to stress, the husband overreacted, and the mother did ask for help. Also, the husband's claim of 5 hours might be exaggerated. The mother's intention wasn't to be disrespectful. Considering all that, the mother isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more concerning. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
