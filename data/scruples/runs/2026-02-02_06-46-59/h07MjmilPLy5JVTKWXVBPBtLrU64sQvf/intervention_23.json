Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, and the husband gets angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The mother was making dinner, and the husband came home. The mother forgot to change the diaper and asked the husband to do it. He tried but got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours and that she's disrespectful. The mother left because she didn't want to argue.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, is the mother at fault here? Well, forgetting to change a diaper occasionally, especially on a stressful day, isn't necessarily wrong. The key points are that this isn't a regular occurrence, and the husband's reaction seems excessive. The mother did ask him to help, which shows she tried to fix the situation. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and clothes, especially when it's a one-time mistake, might be disproportionate. \n\nBut maybe the mother should have been more mindful, given the child is already using pull-ups. However, 2.5-year-olds can still have accidents, and expecting a parent to be perfect all the time is unrealistic. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration if the mother didn't forget for that long. Also, the husband's reaction (throwing things, yelling) seems more about the argument than the actual mistake.\n\nConsidering all that, the mother made a mistake but it's a minor one. The husband's response is more concerning. So the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
