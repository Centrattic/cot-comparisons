Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom forgetting to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, and the husband getting angry when he had to deal with it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The daughter is 2.5, which is old enough that she might be transitioning out of diapers, but pull-ups are used here. The mom was making dinner when she realized she forgot to change the diaper. She asked her husband to do it, and he got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she denies). The husband claims the diaper was really full and her clothes were wet, leading to him being covered in pee. The mom says it's not a regular thing and that it was a stressful day where she lost track of time. The husband is upset about being yelled at, but she left because she didn't want to argue.\n\nNow, considering the options. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key points here are: Did the mom act responsibly? Forgetting once in a while, especially under stress, might be understandable. However, the daughter is 2.5, so maybe the mom should be more attentive. But the husband's reaction seems harsh. He exaggerated the time (5 hours), and she was in the middle of dinner when she realized. She did ask him to help, so maybe she's not entirely at fault. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and being covered in pee might be overreacting. Also, the mom left the situation because she didn't want to argue, which shows she's trying to avoid conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mom should have prioritized the diaper change even while cooking. But it's not a regular occurrence, and she's the primary caregiver. The husband's role here might be to help, not get angry. The husband's claim about disrespect because he was covered in pee seems a bit much. The mom's mistake was a one-time thing, and the husband's reaction is the main issue here. \n\nSo, putting it all together. The mom made a mistake, but it's a one-off and she's the parent. The husband's reaction is more about how he felt rather than a real harm done. The mom's responsibility might be in place, but the husband's overreaction is the bigger problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
