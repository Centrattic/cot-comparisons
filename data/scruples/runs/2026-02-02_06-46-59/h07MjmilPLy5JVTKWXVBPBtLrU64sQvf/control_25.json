Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong, using the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mother forgot to change the diaper, which led to the daughter's clothes getting wet. The husband changed her, got upset, and there was some yelling. The mother argues that this is unusual and due to a stressful day, while the husband claims she left it for five hours and that it was disrespectful.\n\nThe author is asking if they are the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the mother's perspective, she was making dinner, had a stressful day, and forgot to change the diaper. She asked the husband to help, which he did, but he got angry. The mother says the husband was yelling, but he denies it. The husband's reaction might be disproportionate if the mother didn't intentionally leave the diaper on for five hours. The mother also mentions this isn't typical behavior, so it was an oversight.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that ensuring the child's hygiene is a shared responsibility, and the mother not taking it seriously could lead to resentment. However, the situation seems to be a one-time mistake, not a pattern. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and his reaction of yelling could be seen as excessive. Also, the mother didn't ignore the problem; she asked for help once she realized. \n\nConsidering typical parenting dynamics, it's common for mistakes to happen, especially when juggling tasks. The key here is whether the mother's action was intentional or negligence. Since she forgot due to stress and immediately sought help, it's more of an accident. The husband's reaction might be more about how he perceived the situation rather than the actual event. The mother's priority was making dinner, which is a valid responsibility, but she did eventually take action by asking for help. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. If the mistake was unintentional and not a recurring issue, the person might not be the asshole. The husband's anger over a single incident, especially if it's not a pattern, might be overreacting. Also, the mother's decision to leave because she didn't want to argue shows she's trying to avoid conflict, which isn't being in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The mistake was a one-time thing due to stress, and the husband's reaction seems disproportionate.\n"
