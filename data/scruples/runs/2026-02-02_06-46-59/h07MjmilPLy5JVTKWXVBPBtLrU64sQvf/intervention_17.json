Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old who was in a pull-up, which didn't hold well. The mother forgot, asked the father to change it, and he got angry, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points: The mother didn't change the diaper because she was making dinner and had a stressful day. The father felt it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee after wrestling with the kid. He claims she left it for 5 hours, but the mom says that's not true. She left to avoid an argument, and they have a history of arguing.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 2.5 is past toddler potty training. However, the mother mentioned using a pull-up, which isn't as absorbent. So maybe the child had a small accident, leading to wet clothes. The mother was in the middle of cooking when she realized, which is a common multitasking scenario for parents. The father might feel unfairly burdened, but the mother's request to him was reasonable, and the situation led to a conflict.\n\nThe father's anger seems disproportionate. He kicked something and was clearly upset. The mother left to avoid an argument, which is a common strategy to de-escalate. The father's claim of disrespect might stem from feeling blamed or overwhelmed. However, the mother wasn't neglecting the child; it was a one-time oversight during stress. The fact that it's not a recurring issue is important.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share the task of caring for the child. The mother's oversight was a mistake, but not a major one. The father's reaction seems harsh, especially since he was the one to handle the situation. So, the mother isn't entirely wrong, but maybe the father's reaction is part of the problem. But the question is about the mother's fault. Since it was a single incident due to stress, and she took responsibility immediately, she's not in the wrong. The father's response is likely the main issue here. So, answer B.\n"
