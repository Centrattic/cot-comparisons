Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent forgot to change her while making dinner, then asked the husband to do it. The husband got angry, said she left her in it for 5 hours (which she denies), and he was upset about the mess and feeling disrespected.\n\nFirst, the child is 2.5, so maybe she could be potty-trained, but maybe she's not fully trained yet. The parent forgot once because it was a stressful day. She did notice and asked her husband to help. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated\u2014kicking something, being angry about being covered in pee. The parent left because they didn't want to argue.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while isn't necessarily wrong, especially if it's a stressful day. The husband's response seems harsh. The parent is taking responsibility by admitting they forgot, but the husband is making it into a bigger deal than it is. The parent didn't leave the child in the diaper for 5 hours as claimed. So, the parent isn't in the wrong; the husband overreacted. Answer B.\n"
