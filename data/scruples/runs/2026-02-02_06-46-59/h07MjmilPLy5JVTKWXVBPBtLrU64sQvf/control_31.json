Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the mother forgot to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, which was a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. The husband came home, and the mother asked him to change the diaper because she was busy making dinner. The husband got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she denies) and that she was disrespectful because he got covered in pee.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, most kids are past the diaper stage, using pull-ups only for nighttime or occasional accidents. The mother said it's not something that usually happens; this was a one-time stress-related slip-up. She was in the middle of dinner, which is a common time when parents might get distracted. The husband was asked to help, which is reasonable since he was already wrestling with the child. \n\nThe mother's mistake was not changing the diaper, but she didn't intentionally neglect the child. The husband's reaction seems excessive. He got angry, threw something, and yelled, according to her (he says he wasn't yelling). He also claimed she left it for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. The husband's anger seems to be about the mess and possibly feeling disrespected, but the child's well-being wasn't endangered. \n\nThe key points here are that this was an isolated incident, not a recurring problem. The mother was busy and stressed, and the husband was asked to help. The husband's overreaction and making it about disrespect might be the bigger issue here. The mother didn't intent to be negligent; it was a forgetful moment. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the mother isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more concerning than the mother's oversight. The answer should be B (No)."
