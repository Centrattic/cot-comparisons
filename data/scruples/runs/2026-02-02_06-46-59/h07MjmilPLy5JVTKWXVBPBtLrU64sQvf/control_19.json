Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old and wearing a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper during a stressful day while making dinner. The husband came home, and when the parent asked him to change the diaper, he got angry, saying she had it for 5 hours (which she denies) and that she was disrespectful because he got covered in pee.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author made a mistake. The child is 2.5, so they should be potty training or close to it. However, the parent might have been overwhelmed with a stressful day and dinner prep. Forgetting once in a while could happen. The key points here are: the child is usually well-cared for, this was a one-time incident, and the parent realized the mistake and tried to delegate to the husband. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially since the parent says it wasn't a regular occurrence.\n\nThe husband's claim that she left the diaper on for 5 hours might be exaggerated. If the parent typically changes the diaper regularly, then 5 hours would be unusual. Also, the husband's anger about being covered in pee seems like an overreaction. The parent didn't intend to do that, and it's part of normal parenting responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent did forget, which could be a mistake, but it's a common human error, especially under stress. The husband's response of anger and yelling (even if he claims not to be) complicates the situation. The parent left the room to avoid conflict, which shows they didn't want to escalate things.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The husband's reaction might be the bigger issue here. The parent made a small oversight, which is understandable, and the husband's overreaction is the main problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
