Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old, and the mother forgot to change her diaper while making dinner. The husband came home, the mom asked him to change the diaper, but he got angry, thinking she left it for 5 hours and that he ended up covered in pee. The mom says it wasn't 5 hours and that it was a stressful day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The daughter is 2.5, so using pull-ups. The mother forgot to change her, but it's not something that happens often. The husband was wrestling with the kid before, so maybe that's when the accident happened. The mom asked him to change the diaper, then he got upset. The key points here are whether the mother was negligent and if the husband overreacted.\n\nThe mother says it wasn't 5 hours, which the husband claims. If the husband thinks she left the diaper for that long, that's a problem. But the mother was making dinner and had a stressful day, so maybe she was distracted. However, even if it was a few hours, leaving a child in a dirty diaper can cause discomfort or health issues, so maybe the mother should have remembered.\n\nBut wait, the daughter is 2.5, so maybe she's potty training? If she's in pull-ups, maybe she can communicate when she needs to go. But maybe the mom was too busy. The husband was there and could have helped, but the mom asked him to change it. The husband's reaction: yelling, throwing something, getting angry. That's pretty intense. The mother left because she didn't want to argue. \n\nNow, the question is if the mother is in the wrong. The main issue is the forgotten diaper change. If it's a one-time mistake due to a stressful day, maybe it's understandable. But the husband's reaction is also a problem. The mother isn't the only one at fault here. However, the question is specifically about the mother. \n\nSo, the mother forgot once, but it's not a recurring issue. She was cooking, which is a valid task. The husband might have overreacted. The mother's responsibility is to take care of the child, but if she had a valid reason (stressful day) and it's a one-time slip-up, maybe she's not the asshole. On the other hand, the husband's reaction is also problematic, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the mother didn't intend to neglect the child and it was a mistake, maybe she's not the asshole. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
