Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mother forgot to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The daughter was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much, and the husband ended up changing her after wrestling with her. Then the husband got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours and was disrespectful because he got covered in pee. The mom says it was a stressful day and she got distracted while making dinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 2.5, which is old for diapers, but maybe she's still using pull-ups. The mom says this is not something that happens ever. So it was a one-time slip-up. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The time in question is when she was cooking dinner and got distracted. She didn't realize until after he got home and helped with the kid. Then he kicked something, got angry, and she felt yelled at, though he says he wasn't.\n\nNow, the key points here are responsibility and reaction. Did the mom do something wrong by not changing the diaper? Well, she admits she forgot, which is understandable if it was a stressful day. But the kid did end up with a wet pull-up and clothes. However, the husband's reaction seems harsh. Yelling or being angry over a child having a wet diaper seems excessive, especially if it's a one-time mistake. The question is whether the mom is in the wrong for forgetting, or if the husband overreacted.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author (the mom) is in the wrong. The husband's argument is that she left the diaper for 5 hours, but she disputes that. Also, he's upset about being covered in pee, which might be more about his own discomfort than the child's well-being. The mom's explanation seems reasonable: she was cooking, had a stressful day, and forgot. The fact that this is a rare occurrence supports that it's a mistake, not negligence.\n\nHowever, maybe as a parent, you should always prioritize the child's needs over cooking, even if it's stressful. But in this case, she didn't realize until after he got home. So she wasn't neglecting the kid on purpose. The husband's reaction might be more about his own frustration than the actual situation. The mom's choice to not argue and leave might be because she's tired of conflicts, which isn't uncommon in marriages. \n\nConsidering all that, the mom made a mistake but it's a minor, one-time thing. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
