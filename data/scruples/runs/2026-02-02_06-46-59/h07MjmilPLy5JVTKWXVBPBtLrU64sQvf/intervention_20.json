Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The husband was wrestling with her when the mom asked him to change the diaper. He got angry, kicked something, and they had an argument. The mom says he was yelling, he says he wasn't. The husband claims the diaper was left for 5 hours, but the mom says that's not true. Also, he was upset because he got covered in pee from her wet clothes.\n\nThe mom says this is not something that usually happens. It was a stressful day, and she was making dinner when she forgot. The key points here are: Did the mom do something wrong by not changing the diaper? Let's break it down.\n\nForgetting to change a diaper occasionally, especially with a young child, can happen. But since the daughter is 2.5, maybe she's supposed to be using training pants and should be able to communicate when she needs to go. However, the mom might have been distracted. The husband took over, which is okay, but his reaction seems harsh. He got angry and kicked something, which is aggressive behavior. The mom left the room because they argue a lot. \n\nThe husband's claim about 5 hours seems exaggerated if the mom says it's not true. Also, the husband was upset about being covered in pee, which seems a bit much. The mom tried to explain, but he cut her off. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the mom was negligent. If it's a one-time forgetful moment due to stress and she's otherwise diligent, it's not her fault. The husband's reaction is more concerning. He should have handled it calmly instead of reacting angrily. The mom isn't in the wrong here; the husband's behavior is the problem. So the answer is B.\n"
