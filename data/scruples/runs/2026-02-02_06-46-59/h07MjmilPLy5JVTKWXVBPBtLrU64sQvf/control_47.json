Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent not changing their daughter's diaper for a while, leading to some conflict with their spouse.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her, possibly because of a stressful day and being busy with dinner. The husband was home and the parent asked him to change the diaper. The husband got angry, thinking it was left for 5 hours and that he was covered in pee. The parent feels the husband was yelling, but he says he wasn't. They argue and the parent leaves.\n\nNow, to determine if the parent is in the wrong. The parent admits they forgot, but it's not something that happens often. They were in the middle of making dinner, which is a common task. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated, especially since he was wrestling with the child before, which might have contributed to the mess. The parent didn't intentionally leave the diaper for hours, and the husband's claim of 5 hours might be an overestimation. The stress of the day and being caught up in dinner are valid reasons for a lapse.\n\nThe key points are: it's not a regular occurrence, the parent was occupied with cooking, the husband's reaction might be disproportionate, and the parent didn't ignore the child intentionally. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
