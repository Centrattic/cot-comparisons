Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in a situation where they didn't change their daughter's diaper. The husband got angry about it, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, some kids start using the potty, but it's not uncommon for them to still wear pull-ups, especially if they're transitioning. The author forgot to change the diaper, which led to some mess. The husband was upset, thinking it was a 5-hour period, but the author says that's not true. \n\nThe key points here: The author usually takes care of diaper changes, and this was a rare slip-up due to a stressful day while cooking dinner. The husband didn't seem to handle it well, getting angry and making the author feel disrespected when the daughter's clothes were wet. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, forgetting once in a while happens to anyone. The author was in the middle of a task (making dinner) and lost track of time. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate, especially if the incident was a one-time thing. The author didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was a mistake. The husband's accusation of disrespect might be an overreaction, especially since the author was willing to ask for help (asking him to change the diaper). \n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014throwing something, being angry, not listening to explanations\u2014suggests he's the one acting inconsiderate. The author left the room to avoid arguing, which shows they're trying to prevent conflict, not escalate it. \n\nSo, while the author made a mistake, it's a minor one in the grand scheme. The husband's response is more indicative of being the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong.\n"
