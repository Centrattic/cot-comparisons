Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old. The parent forgot to change the diaper, which was a pull-up, and the husband ended up changing her. The husband got angry, saying she didn't have an excuse, and there was some yelling. The author mentions that this is not something that happens often, and it was a stressful day where they lost track of time. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the author says that's not true. He's upset because he got covered in pee when changing her.\n\nFirst, the child is 2.5 years old. At that age, many kids are potty training or have been for a while. A pull-up is more like a training diaper. If she's in a pull-up, maybe she's supposed to be transitioning to the potty. But the parent forgot to change the diaper. However, the parent was making dinner when the husband got home. The husband was wrestling with the kid before the parent realized the diaper wasn't changed. So the parent asked the husband to change it. He did, but there was wet clothes involved, leading to his anger.\n\nThe parent says it's not a regular occurrence and that it was a stressful day. The husband accuses her of leaving it for 5 hours, which she disputes. The husband is upset about being covered in pee. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom the parent's side, forgetting once in a stressful day isn't unusual. The husband might feel that the parent isn't doing their share, but the husband was already wrestling with the child before the realization. The parent asked him to change the diaper, which he did. The husband's reaction seems harsh for a one-time mistake, especially if it's not a regular thing. The parent left because they didn't want to argue. \n\nThe husband's anger might be about the situation (being covered in pee) and maybe about the responsibility. However, the parent was in the middle of making dinner when the husband got home. The key points are that the parent didn't neglect the child, it was a one-off due to stress, and the husband's reaction seems over the top. The parent isn't at fault here. So answer B.\n"
