Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups, and the author forgot to change her diaper for a while. The husband got home, the author asked him to change it, and he got angry. The author claims it's not a usual thing and it was a stressful day. The husband felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author made a mistake. Forgetting to change a diaper for a child who's using pull-ups (which are less absorbent than regular diapers) could lead to leaks. However, the author mentions it's not something that happens often. Stressful days can cause people to lose track of time. But the key point is whether not changing the diaper was negligent.\n\nThe husband's reaction might be excessive if the situation wasn't that bad. The author tried to ask for help, and the husband's anger escalated. The author left the room to avoid an argument, which might indicate a pattern of conflict in the relationship. However, the husband's claim about the diaper being left for 5 hours might be an exaggeration, as the author disputes that. Also, the husband being covered in pee is a hygiene issue, but maybe he should have handled it more calmly.\n\nConsidering the context: the author didn't intentionally neglect the child. It was an oversight due to a busy, stressful time. The husband's reaction seems harsh, possibly due to his own stress or communication issues. The author isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake, especially when they were focused on dinner and asked for help. The husband's anger seems disproportionate unless there's a history of such issues.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
