Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The situation is that the wife forgot to change the diaper while making dinner, asked her husband to do it after she realized, and then the husband got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she says isn't true) and that it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, most kids are already potty-trained. However, the parent mentions she's in a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. So maybe she's transitioning or has a medical reason? Either way, the parent is responsible for changing her. The husband was home and wrestling with the child before being asked to change the diaper. The wife admits she forgot due to a stressful day and was in the middle of dinner. She didn't mean to neglect the child. The husband got upset, saying she had an excuse? But she says she didn't have an excuse, just a stressful day.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh. He claims it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee. But the wife asked him to change the diaper, so he was the one handling the situation. If the diaper was full, maybe he wasn't prepared. Also, he exaggerated the time (5 hours vs. the reality). The wife left the situation to avoid arguing, which is common in stressed marriages. The user is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: as a parent, both should share duties. The wife forgot, but that's understandable given stress and cooking. The husband's anger seems disproportionate. The fact that he was wrestling with the child before being asked might mean he was involved. The husband's claim of being \"covered in pee\" might be an overreaction. The wife didn't intentionally neglect the child, and it's not a recurring issue. The husband's reaction of anger and cutting her off seems harsh. So, the answer is likely B (she's not in the wrong). The husband's reaction is more the issue here.\n"
