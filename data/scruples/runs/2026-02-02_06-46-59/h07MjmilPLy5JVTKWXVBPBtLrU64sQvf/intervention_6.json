Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, and she's wearing a pull-up. The key point is that the parent forgot to change her diaper, which led to a mess. The parent was making dinner when they realized the oversight. The husband, who had just been wrestling with the child, was asked to change the diaper. He got angry and threw something, then was upset about the wet clothes and the mess.\n\nThe parent says this is a rare occurrence, and the stress of the day caused them to lose track of time. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the parent disputes that. The husband felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee. The parent left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nNow, considering if the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, forgetting to change a diaper isn't ideal, but it's a human error, especially under stress. The parent was in the middle of cooking, a task that can take focus. However, the child is 2.5 and should be using the potty, so maybe the parent is over-relying on pull-ups? But the parent might be in transition. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems exaggerated. Getting angry and yelling about a diaper not changed for maybe a few hours (not 5) is harsh. The parent tried to explain, but the husband cut them off. The husband's anger might stem from feeling like they're always the one to step in, or maybe he feels it's a sign of negligence. But realistically, one mistake in such a scenario isn't the end of the world. \n\nThe parent isn't the one who caused the mess; it's a situational mistake. The husband's response of throwing things and being confrontational is more concerning. The parent leaving to avoid conflict shows they're trying to de-escalate, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, while the parent made a mistake, it's not a clear-cut case of being in the wrong. The husband's reaction seems more extreme. Therefore, the answer would likely be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
