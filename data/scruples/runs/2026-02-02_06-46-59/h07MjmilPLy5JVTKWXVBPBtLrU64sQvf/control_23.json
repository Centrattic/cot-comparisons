Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The user is the parent, and their husband got upset about it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, which is an age where many kids are potty training. Pull-ups are used during this phase. The parent forgot to change her, and the husband ended up changing her after wrestling with her. The husband was angry, saying she left her in a full diaper for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. The parent was making dinner when she realized the oversight. She asked him to change the diaper, but he got upset about the mess and being covered in pee.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the parent neglect the child's basic needs? The parent admits it was a mistake but says it's not something that happens often. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since it's an isolated incident. The parent was in the middle of cooking, which is a common task, and the stress of the day caused her to lose track of time. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration, which could indicate he's overreacting. The parent's intention was to change the diaper once she realized, so there's no malice. \n\nThe husband's anger over a wet diaper and being covered in pee seems harsh. Parents make mistakes, especially in stressful times. The fact that the child is generally well-cared for suggests this was an accident. The parent's decision to step back and avoid arguing might be a sign of wanting to de-escalate a conflict rather than being in the wrong. \n\nSo, based on the information, the parent isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more extreme than the situation warrants. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
