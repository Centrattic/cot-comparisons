Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The key points are that the daughter was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee as a regular diaper. The mother was making dinner when she realized she had forgotten to change it. She asked her husband to change it, but he ended up angry because the diaper was really full and she got a bit wet. He got mad, maybe even yelled, and she left to avoid arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not changing the diaper was the mother's fault. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's probably potty training. Maybe she was supposed to be in pull-ups, but the mother usually changes her regularly. The mother says this is not something that happens often, and it was a stressful day where she lost track of time. She was in the middle of making dinner when she realized it. \n\nThe husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The fact that the pull-up was full and caused some wetness might be a point of contention. But is that the mother's fault? Well, she did forget, but she was busy with dinner. However, a 2.5-year-old should be using the potty more consistently, right? Maybe she was in the process of potty training, but if the mother is responsible for changing her, she might have a duty to check or remind her daughter to use the bathroom.\n\nWait, the daughter is 2.5, so maybe she's supposed to be using the potty on her own. The mother might have been negligent in not keeping track of when she last used the bathroom. If the daughter is old enough, she should be able to signal when she needs to go. If the mother was making dinner and the daughter didn't communicate that she needed to go, maybe the mother isn't at fault. But if the mother is responsible for managing her child's hygiene and the daughter is still in pull-ups, maybe the mother is responsible for checking more frequently.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction seems a bit excessive. He was angry about being covered in pee, which is understandable, but yelling and throwing things isn't helpful. The mother left to avoid arguing, which is smart, but the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not changing the diaper.\n\nThe mother's excuse is that it was a stressful day and she lost track of time. If that's the case, maybe it's a one-time mistake and not a pattern. The husband's claim that she left it for 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The mother says it's not true. So, the key is whether the mother's forgetfulness was unreasonable given the circumstances. Making dinner is a valid reason to be busy, but as a parent, one might need to balance childcare with other tasks. If she was supposed to be supervising or caring for the child while cooking, maybe she should have checked on the child more often. But if the daughter was playing independently and the mother was focused on dinner, maybe it's a reasonable oversight.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the daughter is using pull-ups and the mother is the one who puts them on and is supposed to change them regularly, then forgetting once might not be the mother's fault entirely. However, if the daughter is old enough, maybe the mother should encourage potty training instead of relying on pull-ups. But the mother might be using pull-ups as a transitional step. \n\nThe husband's reaction might be part of the problem. Getting angry over a wet diaper and a bit of mess could be disproportionate. However, the mother did ask him to change the diaper, and he might have felt that she was passing off her responsibility. If the mother is responsible for diaper changes and she asked him, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the daughter is old enough, maybe she should be handling it herself, and the mother's reliance on pull-ups is part of the issue.\n\nOverall, the mother's mistake was forgetting, but if it's a rare occurrence and due to a stressful day, maybe she's not in the wrong. The husband's reaction seems more problematic, but the question is about the mother. Since the mother didn't intentionally neglect the child and this is an isolated incident, I think she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
