Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, and the husband getting upset.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, which is old for still using a pull-up, but maybe that's normal for them. The mom forgot to change her diaper because she was busy making dinner after the husband came home. The husband was wrestling with the kid just before, and the mom asked him to change the diaper. Then he got angry because the diaper was full, clothes got wet, and he felt disrespected.\n\nSo, the question is whether the mom is at fault here. The key points are: It's not a regular occurrence, the mom had a stressful day and lost track of time, and she was in the middle of cooking. She realized the mistake and asked her husband to help. He reacted angrily, accused her of leaving the diaper for five hours (which she says isn't true), and was upset about the mess.\n\nFrom the mom's perspective, she made an honest mistake, maybe due to stress and being busy. She tried to delegate the task to her husband. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if he's making up the five-hour part. The fact that this is an isolated incident might mean it's not a recurring issue. However, the mom did forget to change the diaper, which could be seen as neglectful, but given the context, maybe not intentional.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel it's a basic responsibility of parenthood to keep track of a child's needs. But the mom is asking for help, so maybe the husband should have been more understanding. The anger and accusation of disrespect could be the real issue here.\n\nConsidering all that, the husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The mom made a mistake but not a malicious one. Since it's a one-time thing and she was in the middle of a task, it's more of a situational lapse. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
