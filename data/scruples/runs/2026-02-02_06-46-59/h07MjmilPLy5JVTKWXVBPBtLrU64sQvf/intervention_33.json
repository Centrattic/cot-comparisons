Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The parent (the author) was making dinner when she realized she hadn't changed the diaper. The child was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The husband came home and was wrestling with the child. The author asked him to change the diaper, but he got angry, threw something, and accused her of leaving the child for 5 hours, causing a mess and being disrespectful.\n\nThe author mentions it's not something that happens often. The stress of the day made her lose track of time. She was in the middle of making dinner when she realized the mistake. The husband claims she left the diaper for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The husband was upset about the mess and feeling disrespected. \n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 2.5 years old is around the age when they're starting to potty train. Using a pull-up suggests they're in the process. Forgetting to change a diaper, especially if it's a pull-up, might be an oversight, but it's not malicious. The key points here are: the author didn't mean to neglect the child, it was a one-time stress-induced mistake, and the husband's reaction seems disproportionate. \n\nThe husband took the situation out on her, got angry, and accused her of something he knows isn't true (5 hours). His reaction of yelling and throwing things is more concerning. The author left because she didn't want to argue. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, forgetting a diaper change once isn't a big deal, especially given the context. The husband's response of anger and claiming disrespect seems harsh. The author isn't in the wrong for a single oversight, especially under stress. The real issue might be the husband's inability to handle the situation calmly and his accusation of a 5-hour neglect, which is false. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the mistake was minor, unintentional, and the husband's reaction is excessive and unfounded.\n"
