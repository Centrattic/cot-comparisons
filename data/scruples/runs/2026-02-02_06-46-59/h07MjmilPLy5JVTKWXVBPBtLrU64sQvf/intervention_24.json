Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old who was in a pull-up that didn't hold much pee. The mother forgot to change her, and when she asked the father to do it, he got upset and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The mother says it's not something that happens ever, and this was a stressful day where she lost track of time. She was making dinner when she realized the mistake. The father claims she left the diaper for 5 hours, which she disputes. He's upset because he got pee on him when trying to handle the child, and he feels disrespected. The mother left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nNow, evaluating responsibility. The mother did forget, but it's a one-time incident in an otherwise normal routine. She was in the middle of cooking, which is a valid excuse, especially if it was a stressful day. However, as a parent, changing a diaper is a basic responsibility. The key here is whether her oversight was intentional or neglectful. Since she says she forgot and it's not a recurring issue, it seems more like a lapse due to stress and multitasking.\n\nThe father's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and throwing/kicking things is not constructive. He also mischaracterized the situation by saying it was 5 hours when the mother says it wasn't. His anger over being \"covered in pee\" seems disproportionate. Parents should be able to handle these situations without blame, especially in a shared parenting role. The mother's decision to step out of the argument is a common coping mechanism, not necessarily a sign of guilt.\n\nLooking at the dynamic, both parents have valid points but are approaching it from a place of frustration. The mother's mistake was unintentional, and the father's response was overly aggressive. In terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the mother's forgetfulness is a minor slip-up, whereas the father's reaction is more about handling the situation poorly. Since the question is about the mother specifically, the answer would depend on whether the mistake was her fault. Given that she didn't intentionally neglect the child and it was a one-off due to stress, she's not in the wrong. The father's behavior is more to blame here.\n"
