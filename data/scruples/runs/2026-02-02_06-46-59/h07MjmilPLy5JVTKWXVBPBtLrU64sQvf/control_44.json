Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and using pull-ups, which doesn't hold as much pee as a regular diaper. The author forgot to change her diaper for a while. The husband came home while the author was making dinner. She asked him to change it after realizing she'd forgotten, but he got angry, saying she left her for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because his clothes were wet. The author says it wasn't true and that it's not a regular occurrence. The husband got her in the shower, and she left to avoid arguing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong? Let's break it down. Forgetting to change a diaper isn't ideal, but the child is 2.5, so maybe she should be using the potty? But some kids transition later. The author might have been busy with dinner, which is a reasonable activity. She asked her husband to help, which shows she didn't expect him to do it all the time. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014accusing her of a 5-hour wait and calling it disrespectful. That's a problem. The husband's yelling and the argument are part of the issue. The author didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was an oversight. The husband's claim about the 5-hour duration is false, which is important. Also, the clothes being wet might be a minor issue, but his reaction is disproportionate. The fact that this is a rare occurrence adds to the author's defense. So, the husband's overreaction is the main issue here. The author's mistake was forgetfulness under stress, not malicious neglect. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
