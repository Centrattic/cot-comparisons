Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the mother forgetting to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband got home, and she asked him to change it. He did but got angry because the diaper was really full and the clothes were wet. The mom says it's not something that happens often and that the husband is exaggerating the time (saying 5 hours instead of the actual time). She left the room to avoid an argument.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The mother forgot to change the diaper once, which isn't common. Maybe she was stressed and distracted while making dinner. The husband took the diaper change but then got angry, claiming she was disrespectful. He might be overreacting, especially if this is a rare occurrence. The mom left because arguments are common, which suggests there might be communication issues.\n\nIs the mom wrong? She didn't mean to neglect the child; it was a slip-up. The husband's reaction seems harsh. The fact that he was angry about the mess and called it disrespectful might be unfounded, especially if it's not a repeated issue. The mom tried to explain but was cut off. So maybe the husband is in the wrong for overreacting. Therefore, the author (mom) isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
