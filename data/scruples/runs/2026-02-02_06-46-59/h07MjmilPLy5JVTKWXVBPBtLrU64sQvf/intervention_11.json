Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person forgot to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper for a while. The daughter is supposed to be in pull-ups, which don't hold as much as regular diapers. The husband came home, and the writer asked him to change the diaper because they realized it was full. The husband took the child to change the diaper but got angry. He threw or kicked something, then went upstairs, angry, saying the diaper was really full and the clothes were wet. The writer tried to explain, but the husband cut them off. The husband claims the diaper was left for 5 hours (which the writer denies) and feels it's disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The writer left to avoid arguing.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought maybe the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me consider the key points.\n\n1. **Forgetfulness vs. Negligence**: The writer mentions it's not a regular occurrence, and this was a stressful day where they lost track of time. They were making dinner when they realized. The daughter is 2.5, which is a time when some kids are transitioning out of diapers, so maybe they were using pull-ups for easier management. However, even with that, leaving a child in a full diaper could lead to discomfort or skin issues if it's been too long. The husband claims it was 5 hours, which the writer denies. The exact duration is a point of contention here.\n\n2. **Responsibility Sharing**: The writer asked the husband to change the diaper. It's common for parents to share responsibilities. If the husband is willing to help, that's good. However, the writer did ask for help, so they might not be entirely at fault for not doing it themselves. But the fact that they forgot to change it in the first place could be seen as neglecting a basic child care task.\n\n3. **Reaction of the Husband**: The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. Throwing or kicking something, getting angry, and yelling (as per the writer's perception) might indicate that he's overreacting. The writer felt it was yelling, but he says he wasn't. The fact that the husband is upset about being covered in pee could be a valid concern, but the way he handled it (anger, throwing things) is problematic.\n\n4. **Communication**: The writer tried to explain the situation but was cut off. This suggests that there's a communication issue beyond just the diaper incident. Arguing is mentioned as something that's common, which might point to ongoing marital issues rather than just this one incident.\n\n5. **Intent vs. Outcome**: The writer didn't intend to leave the child in soiled diaper, but they forgot. The outcome was that the child was uncomfortable and the husband got upset. However, the husband's reaction might be more about frustration with the writer's forgetfulness rather than the actual incident. The writer's decision to leave the situation to avoid argument is understandable given the history.\n\nNow, the question is, is the author in the wrong? The key here is whether forgetting to change the diaper once, especially under stress, is the writer's fault. Since this is not a recurring issue, it's a one-time lapse. However, child care responsibilities are crucial, and forgetting could be seen as neglectful, even if unintentional. But considering it's a one-time occurrence and the writer realized the mistake and asked for help, maybe the husband's reaction is more the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that basic child care tasks shouldn't be forgotten, and the writer's stress might not be a valid excuse. However, the husband's handling of the situation (anger, physical reactions) is inappropriate regardless.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the writer's forgetfulness is inexcusable or if the husband's reaction is the main problem. The community often looks at AITA posts and considers both parties' perspectives. In many cases, if someone forgets a task once, especially under stress, they're not necessarily the asshole unless there's a pattern. Here, the writer clarifies it's not a regular thing. The husband's overreaction is also a factor. However, the initial forgetfulness might still make the writer partially at fault, but not entirely.\n\nBut according to the user's initial thought, they thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe the consensus would be that the author isn't the asshole, considering it's a one-time mistake. The husband's reaction is more to blame. However, the husband could also be at fault for overreacting. But the question is specifically about the author.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, if there's no pattern and the mistake is minor, the person is often not the asshole. The husband's behavior is more egregious in terms of handling the situation. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
