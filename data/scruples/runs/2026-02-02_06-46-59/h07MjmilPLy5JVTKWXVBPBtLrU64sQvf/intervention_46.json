Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nSo, the scenario: The author forgot to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The daughter is in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The husband came home, they were wrestling with the kid, and the author asked him to change the diaper. The husband did, but then got angry because the diaper was full and the kid got wet. He's upset, says he was covered in pee. The author says it wasn't that bad and he's overreacting. The author left to avoid arguing.\n\nThe author claims this isn't something that regularly happens. They mention it was a stressful day and they lost track of time. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, which she denies. He's upset about being disrespectful to him because he got covered in pee.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me think about the key points here. First, the child's well-being: a 2.5-year-old using pull-ups might be in the process of potty training. Leaving a diaper too long could lead to discomfort or skin issues, but the author says they usually change it regularly. So maybe this was an oversight. \n\nThe husband's reaction: He was asked to change the diaper, did it, and then got angry. His anger might be about the mess or feeling criticized. The author says he was yelling, but he denies it. The husband's claim about 5 hours seems exaggerated if the author says it's not true. That could be a point of contention.\n\nResponsibility sharing: The author was cooking dinner, a busy time. They asked the husband to handle it, which is fair. The husband did step in but then got upset. Maybe the issue is about how it was handled. The author didn't do it, but delegated to the husband, who is now upset about the situation.\n\nPossible factors: The author might not be at fault for a single incident, especially if it's a rare occurrence. The husband's reaction could be disproportionate. However, the author did forget to change the diaper, which could be seen as neglectful, even if unintentional. But given that the child is old enough for pull-ups, maybe the expectation is different. Also, the husband's claim about being covered in pee leading to feeling disrespected might be an overreaction.\n\nAlso, the context of a stressful day and losing track of time could explain the oversight. The husband's anger might be about the mess and the implication that the author is unreliable, leading to arguments. The author left because they don't want to argue, which is understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They forgot, but it's a one-time thing. The husband's response seems harsh. The author isn't necessarily at fault here. The main issue might be the husband's reaction rather than the author's mistake. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
