Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and wearing a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper, leading to some mess. The husband was home, and the author asked him to do it. He got angry, kicked something, and was upset about the mess. The author says this is out of character for them\u2014they usually change the diaper regularly. The stress of the day caused the oversight.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, not changing a diaper when it's needed is a parenting mistake. However, it's a one-time incident, not a pattern. The kid is 2.5, so maybe she's mostly out of diapers, but pull-ups are used sometimes. The stress factor is mentioned, which could affect memory. The husband's reaction seems over the top\u2014yelling, kicking things, being angry about being covered in pee. That seems like the husband's fault too. \n\nThe key points are: the author forgot once due to stress, it's not a recurring issue, and the husband's reaction was harsh. The author didn't intend to be disrespectful. So maybe the husband is overreacting. The author's mistake was forgetting, but the husband's response is more problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
