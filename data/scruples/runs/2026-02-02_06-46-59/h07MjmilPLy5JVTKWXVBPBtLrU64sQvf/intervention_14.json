Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom forgetting to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, leading to an argument with her husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, some kids are still using pull-ups, especially if they're transitioning to potty training. So maybe she's not fully potty trained yet. The mother realized she forgot to change the diaper after the husband got home. She asked him to change it, but then he got angry because the diaper was full and her clothes were wet. The husband says she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The husband ended up getting covered in pee when he changed her, which he found disrespectful.\n\nThe mother explains that it was a stressful day and she lost track of time while making dinner. She usually changes the diaper regularly. The husband claims she didn't have an excuse. The key points here are: was the mother negligent in this case? Did she do something wrong by forgetting once?\n\nWell, everyone makes mistakes, right? Especially parents who are juggling multiple tasks. The fact that this is a rare occurrence suggests she's normally responsible. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling and being angry over a one-time forgetfulness. But the mother didn't seem to intentionally neglect the child. She even asked him to help when she realized the mistake. However, maybe there's a part where she could have been more careful. But given that it was a stressful day and a slip-up, not a pattern, it's understandable.\n\nThe husband's claim about 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The mother's defense that she was cooking dinner and stressed makes sense. So, while she made a mistake, it's a minor one, and the husband's reaction seems excessive. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thought she is, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it's a one-time mistake and she took responsibility by asking him to help. The husband's anger seems unwarranted here. So the answer might be B.\n"
