Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about forgetting to change a 2.5-year-old's diaper, leading to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, so she should be potty trained, right? But they're using pull-ups. Maybe she's not fully trained yet or had an accident. The mom was cooking dinner and forgot, then asked the husband to change the diaper. The husband got angry, said she left her for 5 hours (which she denies), and was upset about being covered in pee. The mom says it's not their usual routine and was a stressful day.\n\nHmm. The key points here are whether the mom was negligent. She forgot once, but it's not a regular thing. She was busy making dinner. The husband's reaction seems harsh. He's upset about being \"covered in pee\" from the clothes, which might be a stretch. Yelling and being angry over a diaper not changed for a short period, especially if the kid isn't in distress, seems over the top. The mom left the situation to avoid arguing, which might indicate she felt it wasn't worth the fight.\n\nThe husband's claim that she left it for 5 hours might be inaccurate. The mom says she realized the oversight and asked him to help, so the time frame might not be as long as he claims. Also, the fact that she's usually consistent with diaper changes suggests it's an isolated incident due to stress.\n\nSo, the mom isn't in the wrong here. The husband's reaction is disproportionate. The answer should be B (No).\n"
