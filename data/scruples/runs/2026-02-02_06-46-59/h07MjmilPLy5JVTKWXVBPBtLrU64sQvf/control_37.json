Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that the mom forgot to change her daughter's diaper, and her husband got angry about it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The husband came home, and the mom asked him to change the diaper. He did, but then got upset because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. She says it wasn't a big deal, but he thought she left her for 5 hours, which she denies. She left because she didn't want to argue.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The mom forgot once because of a stressful day and was cooking. It's not something that usually happens. The husband was angry and maybe overreacted by yelling or being disrespectful. The mom left the situation to avoid arguing, which is understandable. \n\nIs the mom at fault? Well, she did forget to change the diaper, but it's a one-time incident. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if it's not a recurring issue. The fact that he threw something (kicked something) and was angry might indicate he overreacted. The mom explains the stress of the day and was in the middle of cooking. \n\nThe husband's claims about her leaving it for 5 hours being disrespectful\u2014maybe he's taking it more personally. The mom's main issue was the situation, not neglect. Since this is an isolated incident and she's usually on top of it, she's probably not in the wrong. The husband's reaction might be more about their relationship dynamics than the actual event. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She made a mistake, but it's not a pattern, and the husband's response seems excessive.\n"
