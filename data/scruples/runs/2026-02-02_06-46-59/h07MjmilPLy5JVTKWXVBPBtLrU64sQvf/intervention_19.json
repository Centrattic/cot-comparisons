Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. \n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent (author) forgot to change the diaper, leading to some leakage. The husband stepped in to help, got upset because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The author claims it wasn't a regular occurrence and that they were stressed, making a mistake. The husband felt disrespected, saying the author left her in it for 5 hours and that he ended up with pee on him.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 2.5 is when many kids transition from diapers to training, but pull-ups are still used for nighttime or when supervision is hard. However, 2.5-year-olds can hold their urine for a while but might still have accidents if not monitored. The key points here are the author's forgetfulness and the husband's reaction.\n\nThe author says they didn't mean to leave the diaper on for that long and that it's not their usual behavior. They were in the middle of cooking dinner when they realized the mistake. The husband's anger seems to stem from both the situation and perhaps feeling that the author is being dismissive. The author left the room to avoid an argument, which might indicate tension in their relationship.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, forgetting once in a while, especially under stress, isn't necessarily wrong. However, the child's hygiene is important, and relying on pull-ups that don't hold as well as diapers could contribute to accidents. The husband might feel that the author should be more attentive, especially since it's a common chore in parenting. On the other hand, the husband's reaction of anger and physicality (kicking something) might be excessive for a mistake that's not typical.\n\nThe author's explanation about stress and not usually neglecting this duty is a mitigating factor. But the husband's feeling of disrespect because of the mess and the perceived neglect could be valid from his perspective. The question is whether the author's forgetfulness was a legitimate oversight or neglect. Since it's a one-time incident and the author is usually diligent, maybe the husband overreacted. However, the fact that the child was in a less effective diaper type (pull-up) might mean the author should have checked more frequently.\n\nIn terms of responsibility sharing, the husband offered to help, which the author accepted, but then he got upset. The author left the argument, which might be a sign of avoiding conflict, but doesn't necessarily make them right or wrong. \n\nOverall, the author made a mistake, but it's a common one in parenting. The husband's reaction seems harsh given the context. The author isn't in the wrong for a single incident, especially under stress. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
