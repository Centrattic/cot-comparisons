Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is at fault for not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The situation involves a stressful day, a request to the husband to change the diaper, and a subsequent argument.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, most kids are past the diaper stage, but some might still use pull-ups, especially if they're transitioning. The mother forgot to change her, possibly because she was busy making dinner. She asked her husband to change it, and he did, but later got upset. \n\nThe husband claims she left the diaper for 5 hours and that she didn't have an excuse. But the mother says it wasn't 5 hours and that it was a stressful day where she lost track of time. The husband also felt disrespected because he got covered in pee. However, the mother says this is extremely unusual and that the diaper is usually changed regularly. \n\nNow, considering the age of the child, if she's 2.5 and still in a pull-up, maybe she can communicate when she needs to go. If the mother forgot, maybe she could have checked or asked the child. But the situation was a one-time mistake, not a regular occurrence. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling and being angry over a wet diaper might be overreacting. \n\nThe mother's reasoning is that she was busy and it was a stressful day. She took responsibility by asking her husband to change the diaper. The husband's claim about the 5 hours seems exaggerated. The mother left the room to avoid an argument, which shows she didn't want to escalate things. \n\nIn terms of fault, if it's a rare mistake and the husband is overreacting, the mother isn't necessarily at fault. The key points are the age of the child, the infrequency of the incident, and the husband's disproportionate response. The mother's intent wasn't malicious; it was an oversight. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
