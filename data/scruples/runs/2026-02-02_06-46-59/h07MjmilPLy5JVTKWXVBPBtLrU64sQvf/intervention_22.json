Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to an argument with her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mother forgot to change her diaper, and when she realized, she asked the father to do it. The father was upset, got angry, and the mother felt he was yelling. The father claims she left the diaper for 5 hours, which she denies. The mother says it was a stressful day and she lost track of time while cooking dinner. The father feels disrespected because he ended up covered in pee from the wet clothes.\n\nThe user thinks the author (mother) is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe mother's defense is that this is a one-time mistake due to a stressful day and she was in the middle of making dinner. She didn't mean to neglect the child and immediately asked her husband to help when she realized. The father's reaction seems harsh, especially if the duration wasn't as long as he claimed. The mother left it on purpose or was negligent? The key here is whether forgetting once due to stress is a valid excuse. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's responsibility as a parent includes helping with diaper changes, even if the mother usually does it. If the mother was busy, she could have asked for help earlier. However, the father's reaction (kicking something, being angry, not listening to her explanation) might be disproportionate. The mother left the situation because arguing was unproductive, which is a point in her favor.\n\nBut the question is about the mother's wrongdoing. Since she forgot once, but it's not a recurring issue, and she took action when she realized, it's a mistake rather than negligence. The father's response seems more problematic. Therefore, the mother isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
