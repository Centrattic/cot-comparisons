Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom forgetting to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, which was a pull-up and didn't hold much. Her husband came home while she was making dinner, and after the kid had been wrestling with him. She asked him to change the diaper, and he got angry, saying she had no excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says this doesn't happen often, and it was a stressful day. She forgot, but when she realized, she was in the middle of dinner and asked her husband. He reacted angrily, even though she tried to explain. The husband claims she left it on for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nWell, the daughter is 2.5, which is old for a diaper, but pull-ups are sometimes used for easier changes during certain activities. However, the mother forgetting to change it is a mistake, but the frequency and the husband's reaction matter. The key points are: the mother made a rare mistake due to stress, she asked her husband for help, and he responded by getting angry and yelling, then kicked or threw something. The mother left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nThe husband's actions might be more problematic. Reacting with anger over a wet diaper, especially if it was an honest mistake and they usually handle it well, could be overreacting. Also, creating a hostile environment by yelling and physical actions (kicking) is not appropriate. The mother's apology or asking for help is not an excuse for the husband to escalate the situation. \n\nBut the initial question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Since she didn't intend to neglect her child and it was a one-time slip-up, maybe she's not. The husband's response is probably the bigger issue here. So the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
