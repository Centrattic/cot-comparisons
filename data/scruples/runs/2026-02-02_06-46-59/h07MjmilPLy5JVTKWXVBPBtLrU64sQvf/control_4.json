Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mother forgot to change her daughter's diaper for a while. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The husband came home, and the mom asked him to change the diaper. He did, but got angry because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The mom says it wasn't 5 hours, and that it was a stressful day where she got distracted while making dinner. The husband is upset, thinking she didn't have an excuse and that it was disrespectful because he ended up getting pee on him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the mom made a mistake. Forgetting a diaper change once is understandable, especially if it's a busy or stressful day. She mentions that this doesn't happen often and that she would have changed it if she had noticed. The pull-up might have a smaller capacity, so even a short time could lead to a full diaper. The husband's reaction seems a bit harsh. Yelling and getting angry over a one-time mistake, especially when the mom is already apologizing, might be an overreaction. Also, he claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. Without evidence, his claim might be exaggerated to show her wrongness.\n\nThe husband's argument that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee is a bit confusing. If he was the one who changed the diaper and got wet in the process, maybe he's taking on the responsibility but then being upset about it. The mom asked him to help, so perhaps he should expect some mess. Also, the fact that they argue a lot now adds to the tension. The mom left the situation to avoid conflict, which is understandable if their communication is already strained.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents often share tasks. The mom was busy making dinner when she realized the mistake. Asking the husband to help is reasonable. The husband's anger seems misplaced if it's a one-time incident and not part of a pattern. The key points are that it's not a recurring issue, the mom is usually responsible, and the husband's reaction is more about his own frustration than a genuine problem with the child's care.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mom isn't wrong. The husband's overreaction is the issue here, not the single instance of forgetting a diaper change. The answer should be B (No).\n"
