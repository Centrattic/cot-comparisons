Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves the author forgetting to change the diaper while making dinner, then asking the husband to do it. The husband got angry, saying the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The author felt he was yelling, but he denies it. The author is 2.5 years old, uses a pull-up, and the husband was wrestling with her before.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author admitted to forgetting, which isn't unheard of, especially if it was a stressful day. They mentioned that the diaper is usually changed regularly, so this wasn't a pattern. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author was handling dinner and the diaper was a pull-up, which doesn't hold as well. The husband said she was left for 5 hours, but the author disputes that. The husband also felt it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee, but that seems like an overreaction if the clothes were just slightly wet.\n\nThe key points here are the frequency of diaper changes, the author's usual responsibility, and the husband's reaction. Since this isn't a recurring issue, the author's forgetfulness in a busy moment might be understandable. The husband's anger and accusation of disrespect could be disproportionate, especially since the author didn't intentionally neglect the child. The fact that the author was making dinner and the situation was stressful adds context. The husband's reaction of anger and the author stepping back to avoid conflict might indicate that he overreacted. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake, especially when they're usually responsible. The husband's reaction seems more about the situation's stress than the actual problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
