Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The daughter was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The husband came home, the author asked him to change the diaper, and then he got angry. The author says this never happens, it was a stressful day, and the husband exaggerated the time (said 5 hours, which isn't true). The author felt he was yelling, he denies it, and he was upset about getting pee on him.\n\nFirst, the author forgot to change the diaper, which is a common parental responsibility. The daughter is 2.5, so she should be using training pants, but maybe she's not fully potty trained yet. The author was in the middle of cooking dinner when they realized the oversight. The husband offered to help, but then got angry when the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The author left because they don't want to argue anymore.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while isn't unusual, especially on a stressful day. The author took responsibility by asking the husband to change the diaper. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. He's upset about being covered in pee, which is understandable, but maybe he's holding the author to an unrealistic standard. The author didn't intentionally neglect the child, and it's a one-time incident. The husband's anger might stem from stress or other issues. The author isn't at fault here; they made a mistake but tried to address it. The husband's reaction is more concerning. So, the answer is B.\n"
