Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a parent of a 2.5-year-old. She forgot to change her daughter's diaper, which is in a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. The husband came home, and she asked him to change it. He did, but then he got angry, claiming she left it for 5 hours and that she was disrespectful because his clothes got wet. The author says she was stressed, making dinner, and it was a one-time mistake. The husband denies yelling, but she felt he was.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author made a mistake. Forgetting to change a diaper once, even if it's a pull-up, could be seen as an oversight. But is that enough to be \"in the wrong\"? The husband's reaction seems intense\u2014throwing/kicking something, being angry, and calling it disrespectful. His claim about 5 hours might be an exaggeration, which the author disputes. \n\nThe key points are the frequency of such incidents. The author mentions it never happens. So it's an isolated incident. The husband's reaction might be disproportionate. The author was in the middle of cooking, which is a valid reason, and the daughter's clothes were only a little wet. The husband's anger and the escalation to arguments might stem from communication issues or stress rather than the actual event.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should share the load, and asking for help is okay. The husband stepping in to change the diaper is good, but his anger over a minor issue is problematic. The author's decision to leave quietly might be because of a pattern of yelling, which is a red flag in the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for a one-time oversight, especially given the context. The husband's overreaction and the way he's handling it might be the bigger issue. Therefore, the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
