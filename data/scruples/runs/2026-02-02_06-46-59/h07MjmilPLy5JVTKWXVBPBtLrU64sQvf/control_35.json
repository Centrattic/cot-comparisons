Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, which led to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mother forgot to change her diaper while making dinner. The husband was home, wrestled with the daughter, and then the mother asked him to change the diaper. He did, but got angry, saying she left her in it for 5 hours (which she denies). He was upset about the mess and felt disrespected. The mother left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the mother forget to change the diaper once, or was it a longer period? She says it was a one-time lapse due to a stressful day and being busy with dinner. The husband claims it was 5 hours, which she says isn't true. The daughter was in a pull-up, which holds less, so maybe the mess was worse. The husband got angry and threw/kicked something, then she left.\n\nThe mother's perspective: It's not something that normally happens; it was a stressful day. She was in the middle of making dinner. She asked her husband to help, which he did, but he got angry. She felt he was yelling. She doesn't believe she's wrong here.\n\nThe husband's perspective: He's upset about the mess and feels disrespected because he ended up covered in pee. He says she had no excuse and that the diaper was really full. Also, he claims the 5-hour duration.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether she's the asshole here. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, people often judge based on intent and context. The mother forgot once because of a stressful day and was busy. It's not a recurring issue. She did ask her partner to help, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction seems excessive\u2014throwing/kicking things, getting angry over a one-time mistake. The mother left to avoid conflict, which is a common coping mechanism. The husband's claim about the duration might be an exaggeration, which could be part of the problem. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were inconsiderate or if they overreacted. The mother's mistake was a one-time thing, not a pattern. She did ask for help. The husband's reaction seems overblown, especially if the duration was a misunderstanding. The mother isn't in the wrong here. The husband's anger and the escalation of the situation point more towards his behavior being the issue. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
