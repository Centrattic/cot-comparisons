Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. The author didn't change their daughter's diaper for a while during a stressful day, and the husband got angry about it. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The husband was wrestling with her before, and when the author asked him to change it, he did but was clearly upset, even throwing or kicking something. The author says he overestimated the time (5 hours instead of reality), and that it was stressful. The husband felt it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nFirst, the main question here is whether the author made a mistake by not changing the diaper. The daughter is 2.5, which is around potty training age. So, maybe the pull-up wasn't the best choice if she's supposed to be using the toilet. However, the parent might still use pull-ups for certain situations. The stress of the day could explain the oversight, but does that justify not changing the diaper? The husband's reaction is also a point to consider. He was helping out by changing the diaper, but then got angry. The author left the task to him, which is part of shared parenting responsibilities. However, the husband's anger and the accusation of being disrespectful are extreme, especially if the situation wasn't that bad. \n\nThe author tried to explain but was cut off, which might indicate communication issues. The husband's claim of 5 hours seems exaggerated, and the author is defensive. The key points are: the parent forgot due to stress, the husband took over but reacted angrily, and the daughter wasn't in a regular diaper. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's mistake might be understandable, but they should have taken responsibility or communicated better. However, the husband's overreaction and the context of their relationship (arguing often) might shift the blame towards him. The parent's action caused some discomfort to the husband, but if it's a one-time incident and they usually handle it well, maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No) because the parent made an honest mistake in a stressful situation and delegated the task, even if it was a pull-up. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings than the actual harm to the child. The child isn't hurt, and the parent's usual diligence is noted. So the author isn't the asshole here; the husband is.\n"
