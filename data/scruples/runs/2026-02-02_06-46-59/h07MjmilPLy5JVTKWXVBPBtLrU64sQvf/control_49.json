Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The story is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper for a while, which was a once-in-a-while mistake. The husband got angry and there's some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author didn't change the diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The author was busy making dinner when the husband came home. She asked him to change it, but by then the diaper was full, and the clothes were wet. The husband was upset, maybe yelling. The author left to avoid an argument. \n\nThe key points here: The author usually changes the diaper regularly, this was a rare slip-up due to a stressful day. The husband claims it was 5 hours, which the author says is false. The husband is upset about being covered in pee, but the author might not be at fault for the mistake. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while, especially with a stressful day, isn't necessarily wrong. Parents make mistakes. The husband's reaction seems harsh. The author did ask him to help, which is reasonable. The husband's anger over a one-time incident where the child isn't harmed seems excessive. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
