Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, leading to some tension with their husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, which is typically an age when kids are being potty trained. Using a pull-up suggests she might still be in the process, but the parent usually changes her regularly. The key point here is that this incident didn't happen often. The parent forgot because of a stressful day and was busy making dinner. The husband asked to change the diaper, but the parent didn't get to it in time, leading to a full diaper and some mess.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems intense. He was angry, threw something, and later said he kicked something. The parent felt he was yelling, but he claims he wasn't. The parent left the room to avoid an argument. The husband accused the parent of leaving it for 5 hours, which the parent denies. The husband also felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nNow, considering the context: the parent did forget, but it's not a recurring issue. The stress of the day and being in the middle of making dinner are valid factors. The husband, despite being asked to change the diaper, didn't do it immediately and then got angry. The parent's response was to leave, avoiding conflict. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. Forgetting once in a while, especially under stress, isn't necessarily wrong. The husband's anger and the physical reaction (throwing/kicking) are concerning. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share in childcare. The parent forgot, but the husband could have handled the situation more calmly. The parent didn't intentionally neglect the child. The husband's reaction of anger and the accusation of disrespect seem excessive. The parent's action of leaving to avoid argument is understandable given their relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong for a one-time lapse under stress, especially when it's not a habit. The husband's overreaction is more concerning. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
