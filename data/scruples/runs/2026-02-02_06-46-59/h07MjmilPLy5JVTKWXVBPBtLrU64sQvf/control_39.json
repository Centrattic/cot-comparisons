Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the woman is in the wrong for not changing her daughter's diaper. The situation is that she forgot to change the diaper, her husband changed it but got upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up. The woman was making dinner when she realized she had forgotten to change the diaper. Her husband had just wrestled with the kid, and she asked him to change it. He did, but got angry, saying she didn't have an excuse and that it was disrespectful. She argues that it wasn't her usual behavior and that she was stressed, and he exaggerated the time the diaper was left on (he said 5 hours, which she disputes). She left because she didn't want to argue.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, not changing a diaper for a young child is generally not a big deal if it's an occasional slip-up, especially if it's due to being busy or stressed. The key here is that this isn't something that happens regularly. The husband's reaction seems over the top. Getting angry about a wet diaper that the parent forgot to change once, especially when the parent is already managing dinner and the child, might be considered harsh. Also, the husband's claim about being covered in pee and finding it disrespectful could be an overreaction. The fact that the husband got angry and kicked something adds to the tension in their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, as a parent, the responsibility to care for a child's needs is important. However, everyone makes mistakes, and the stress of daily life can lead to lapses. The husband's response of yelling and getting angry might be the bigger issue here. The woman isn't the only one at fault, but the question is specifically about whether she's in the wrong. Since this was a one-time mistake due to stress and not her usual behavior, she's probably not the asshole here. The husband's overreaction is more problematic. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
