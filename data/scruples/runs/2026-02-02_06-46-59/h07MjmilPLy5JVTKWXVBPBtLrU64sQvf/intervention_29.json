Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, which led to a conflict with their husband. The husband got angry, saying the diaper was full and her clothes were wet, even though the author claims it wasn't for 5 hours as he alleged. The author feels stressed and was in the middle of making dinner when they realized the oversight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author made a significant mistake. The key points here are that the child is 2.5, which is an age where many kids are in the process of potty training. The parent forgot to change the diaper, which is a responsibility. However, the husband's reaction seems harsh. The author mentions it's not a regular occurrence and that the day was particularly stressful. The husband's claim of 5 hours seems exaggerated, and the author was handling dinner, which is a valid part of managing household responsibilities.\n\nThe husband's response included anger and accusations of disrespect, which might be disproportionate to the situation. The author tried to explain but was cut off, leading to an argument. The husband's actions (kicking/knocking something, being angry) and the author leaving the situation to avoid conflict suggest that the husband's behavior was more intense than the situation warranted.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, both parents should share in childcare duties. The author asked the husband to change the diaper, which is a reasonable request. The husband's reaction might stem from stress or a different perception of the situation. However, the author's mistake was a one-time lapse, not a pattern. The husband's response seems to have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a mistake due to stress but took responsibility by asking their husband to help. The husband's reaction was the real issue here. So the answer should be B (No)."
