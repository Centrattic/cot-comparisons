Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using a pull-up. The husband got home, the author was making dinner, and forgot to change the diaper. The husband helped but got upset when the diaper was full and she was wet. He was angry, maybe even yelling, and the author left.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author didn't change the diaper, but the husband did. The author says the diaper was a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much. The daughter was in a stressful situation the day before, and the author was distracted making dinner. The husband claims it was 5 hours (which the author denies), and he felt disrespected because of getting covered in pee.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, 2.5-year-olds usually don't need diapers all day, but they might still use pull-ups for naps or occasional accidents. The author might have been busy and forgot, which is human error. The husband's reaction seems harsh. He's upset over a diaper not changed for a few hours, but the author says it's not a regular thing and they usually do it. The husband might be overreacting, especially if it's not a pattern. The author didn't mean to leave her in it; it was a lapse in a stressful time. The husband's response\u2014getting angry, maybe yelling\u2014seems out of proportion. The author left because they didn't want to argue. \n\nAlso, the husband helped change the diaper, so he was involved. Maybe he's using this as a way to vent other frustrations? The author isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake, especially under stress. The husband's reaction is more concerning. The answer is B, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
