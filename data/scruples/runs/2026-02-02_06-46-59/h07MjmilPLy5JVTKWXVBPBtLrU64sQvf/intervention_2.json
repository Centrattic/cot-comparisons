Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their toddler's diaper, which then leads to the husband being upset.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper after the husband wrestled with her. The parent asked the husband to change it, but then the husband got angry when he found the diaper full and her clothes wet. The parent argues that the husband was yelling, and they didn't argue because they usually do. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours (which she says isn't true) and felt disrespected because he got covered in pee.\n\nThe key points here are: the parent forgot once due to a stressful day, it's not a recurring issue, and she was in the middle of making dinner. The husband's reaction seems harsh because it's an isolated incident. The parent taking responsibility by asking him to change it shows they care. The husband's anger over a one-time mistake, especially since the child is old enough to be in pull-ups, might be disproportionate. The parent leaving the room to avoid arguing isn't necessarily wrong, but the husband's reaction of being angry and yelling is problematic. \n\nConsidering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong for a single oversight. The husband's overreaction is more concerning. So the answer should be B.\n"
