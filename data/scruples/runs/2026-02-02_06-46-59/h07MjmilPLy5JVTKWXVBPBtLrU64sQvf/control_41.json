Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the mother) is in the wrong for not changing her daughter's diaper. The situation is that she forgot to change the diaper, and the husband got angry and upset. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The husband came home after wrestling with the child, so maybe active play makes accidents more likely. The mother was making dinner and forgot to change the diaper. She asked the husband to do it, but he got angry when the diaper was full and the child's clothes were wet.\n\nThe husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but the mother says that's not true. He also says it's disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The mother left because she didn't want to argue.\n\nNow, considering the facts: Forgetting once in a while, especially during a stressful day, is understandable. The husband's reaction seems harsh. He took it out on her for a minor oversight. The child's well-being isn't in question; it's just a diaper change. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and being covered in pee seems excessive. The mother tried to ask for help and left the situation to avoid conflict. \n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014throwing/kicking something, being angry\u2014shows he's handling the situation poorly. The mother isn't at fault for a one-time mistake, especially when the diaper is usually changed regularly. The husband's reaction is the bigger issue here. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
