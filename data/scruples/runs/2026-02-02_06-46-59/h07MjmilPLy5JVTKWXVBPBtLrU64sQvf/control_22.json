Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a mom forgetting to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband comes home, she asks him to do it, he does but gets upset, and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5, which is old enough that she might be using pull-ups, so maybe she's transitioning from diapers. The mom forgot to change her diaper, which led to the child's clothes getting wet. The husband got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she disputes), and he felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nThe mom says this is not usual and that the day was stressful, making her lose track of time. She was in the middle of making dinner. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling, throwing/kicking something. He also accused her without listening to her explanation.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the mom do something wrong? Forgetting once in a stressful day isn't necessarily wrong. However, a 2.5-year-old might be potty training, so maybe the mom should have been more attentive. But the husband's reaction seems overly harsh, especially if it's a one-time incident. The mom might have made a mistake, but the husband's response is part of the problem here. The question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Since it's a single lapse and not a pattern, and she took responsibility by asking him to change her, the answer might be B (she's not in the wrong). The husband's overreaction is more of an issue.\n"
