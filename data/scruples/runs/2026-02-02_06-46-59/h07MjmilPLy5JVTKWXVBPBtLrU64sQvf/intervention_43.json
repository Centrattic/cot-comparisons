Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2 1/2, so she's using pull-ups. The key points here are that the author (a parent) forgot to change the diaper, the husband took over, got upset, and there's some conflict now.\n\nFirst, the author says that this doesn't happen often\u2014only yesterday due to a stressful day. The husband thought she left the diaper on for 5 hours, but the author says that's not true. The husband was angry because the diaper was full and the child's clothes were wet, and he felt disrespected because he got covered in pee.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main issues are: forgetting to change the diaper, which is a normal parental responsibility, and then the husband's reaction. \n\nThe author didn't mean to neglect the child. It was a one-time slip-up due to stress and being busy with dinner. The child wasn't harmed; it was just a wet diaper and slightly wet clothes. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling and making a big deal out of it. The fact that the author immediately asked him to change the diaper once she realized shows she took responsibility quickly. \n\nBut then the husband took it out on her, maybe overreacting. The author left because they argue a lot and didn't want to escalate things. The husband's claim that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee seems a bit self-centered. The main issue is the child's comfort and hygiene, which the author did address once she remembered.\n\nHowever, the husband might feel that the author didn't take her responsibility seriously. But given that it was an isolated incident and the child wasn't in danger or discomfort for too long, maybe the husband's reaction is the real problem here.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake. The husband's overreaction is more concerning. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
