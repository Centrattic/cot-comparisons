Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is at fault for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and using pull-ups, which don't hold as much urine. The husband got home while the author was making dinner and noticed the issue. The author asked him to change the diaper, but he got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours and was disrespectful because he got covered in pee.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the daughter regularly has her diaper changed. This time was an exception due to a stressful day and being preoccupied with dinner. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the author disputes that. The key here is whether not changing a diaper for a few hours (even if not 5) is unreasonable. Since the child is in pull-ups, which are meant for occasional use and less leakage than diapers, maybe the timing is a factor. However, 2.5-year-olds can hold it for a while, but a full pull-up can cause discomfort and potential health issues if left too long.\n\nThe author's mistake was forgetting, but it's a one-time lapse. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if the time wasn't as long as he claims. The author tried to ask for help, which is reasonable. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and feeling disrespected because he got pee on him might be overreacting. The author left because arguing is common, which adds context about their relationship dynamics.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for a one-time forgetfulness, especially under stress. The husband's reaction is more problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
