Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper while making dinner. The husband came home and the parent asked him to change it, but he got angry. The parent says it's not something that normally happens, and the husband exaggerated by saying it was left for 5 hours. The parent left because they didn't want to argue and felt yelled at, though the husband denies yelling. Also, the parent mentions it was a stressful day and they lost track of time.\n\nNow, considering the child's age, 2.5 years old is beyond the typical age for diapers since most children are toilet-trained by 3. So using a pull-up might be part of the issue here. However, the parent forgot to change it, leading to the child getting wet and the husband being covered in pee. The parent was in the middle of making dinner, which is a common task, but forgetting a diaper change for a young child could be seen as neglectful, especially if the child is typically trained. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems over the top, but the parent's mistake in not changing the diaper led to the situation. Even if the parent was busy, the child's basic needs should take priority. The parent's excuse of a stressful day might be valid, but it doesn't excuse the oversight. The husband's anger could stem from feeling disrespected if he was covered in pee, but the parent's responsibility is to the child first. \n\nHowever, the parent did ask the husband to change the diaper when they realized the mistake, which shows they acknowledged the issue. The husband's reaction being excessive (claiming 5 hours, getting angry) complicates things. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's some fault in forgetting a basic care task. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's stress and the child's age might mitigate some blame. But overall, the parent did neglect the child's hygiene, leading to discomfort for the child and the husband. So, the answer is leaning towards A, but maybe B if considering the stress and the child's age. Hmm.\n"
