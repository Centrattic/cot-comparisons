Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old who was in a pull-up that didn't hold as much pee. The mother forgot to change her diaper, and the husband ended up changing it but got upset.\n\nFirst, the mother admits she had a stressful day and lost track of time. She was in the middle of making dinner when she realized she forgot. The husband was angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she denies), and he felt disrespected because he got covered in pee. But the mother says this doesn't usually happen, and she would have changed it if she realized.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the mother intentionally neglect the diaper? It seems like she forgot due to being busy and stressed. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so maybe she's starting to use the potty, but the mother still changes her diaper. However, the pull-up might not be as effective. The husband's reaction seems over the top\u2014yelling and being angry over a wet diaper. He also might have exaggerated the time she left it.\n\nThe mother's justification is that it's not her usual behavior and that the timing was due to cooking dinner. The husband's claim that she left it for 5 hours isn't proven. The fact that the husband got upset and covered in pee might be his own reaction more than the mother's fault. Also, the mother left the room to avoid an argument, which could indicate she felt it wasn't worth fighting over.\n\nSo, considering that the mother didn't intentionally neglect the diaper and the husband's reaction seems excessive, the author might not be in the wrong. The problem is more about communication and the husband's overreaction rather than the mother's negligence. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
