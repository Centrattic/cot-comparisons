Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the mother forgot to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband was home and the mother asked him to do it. He did, but got angry because the diaper was full and her clothes were a bit wet. The mother says it wasn't a regular occurrence and that she was stressed and distracted while making dinner. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, which she denies. He also felt disrespected because he got covered in pee.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The child is 2.5, so she might be in pull-ups, which is common for that age. The mother forgot to change her, but it's not something that happens often. The husband was helping by wrestling with her, then was asked to change the diaper. He took it out of the room and got angry. The mother left because she didn't want to argue.\n\nThe mother's defense is that it was a stressful day and she lost track of time. She was in the middle of making dinner. The husband's anger seems to be about the mess and feeling disrespected. But is the mother at fault? Well, forgetting once in a while, especially under stress, might be understandable. However, leaving a child in a dirty diaper for too long could be considered neglectful, but the child is 2.5, so maybe she's past the stage of needing frequent changes. The husband's reaction might be over the top. The mother didn't intentionally leave it for 5 hours, and the husband's claim could be an exaggeration. \n\nBut from the husband's perspective, being asked to clean up a mess that he feels was preventable might lead to frustration. However, the mother did ask for help, which is a shared responsibility. The husband's reaction of anger and yelling is problematic. The mother leaving to avoid arguing shows she doesn't want conflict, which isn't her fault.\n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. She had a stressful day and forgot, but the husband's reaction seems excessive. The fact that this isn't a regular issue supports that she's not being neglectful. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
