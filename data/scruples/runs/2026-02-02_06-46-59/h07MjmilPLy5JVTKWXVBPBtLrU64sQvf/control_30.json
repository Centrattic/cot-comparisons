Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about forgetting to change a 2.5-year-old's diaper, leading to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5, so she should be using training pants. The user says they usually change her regularly. The husband got home, and the user was making dinner. She forgot to change the diaper, and when she asked him to do it, he got angry. He claims she left her in it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. He got upset because the diaper was full and her clothes were wet, and she left him to deal with it, which made him covered in pee. He's upset about the mess and the perceived disrespect.\n\nThe user is asking if she's the asshole here. So, is she in the wrong? Well, forgetting to change a diaper once, especially with a toddler who's in pull-ups, isn't necessarily a big issue. She did ask her husband to help when she realized. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. He's angry about the mess and the supposed disrespect. But the user says this is not a regular occurrence and it was a stressful day. He's calling her out for an excuse, but she's explaining the situation. The user left to avoid an argument, which is a common response in their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points: She forgot once, it's not a habit, she asked for help, and his reaction seems excessive. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The user isn't at fault here. The answer is B.\n"
