Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user says the question is whether the author, who forgot to change their daughter's diaper, is the asshole.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and wearing pull-ups, which don't hold as much as regular diapers. The mom forgot to change her, and when she realized, she asked her husband to do it. He did but got angry because the diaper was full and her clothes were wet. He claimed she left it for 5 hours, which the mom says isn't true. The background mentions it's not a usual thing; yesterday was stressful and she lost track of time while cooking dinner.\n\nSo, the mom didn't intentionally neglect the child. It was a one-time slip-up during a stressful day. She was in the middle of making dinner when she remembered. The husband took it out of proportion by getting angry, maybe yelling, and making it an issue of disrespect. The mom left the room to avoid arguing. The husband's reaction seems harsher than the situation. The mom isn't in the wrong because it was unintentional and not a recurring problem. The husband's response might be the issue here. So, the answer should be B.\n"
