Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent forgot and asked the husband to change it. The husband got angry, threw something, and was upset because the diaper was full and the kid's clothes were wet. The author says it was a stressful day and they were cooking dinner, so they forgot. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the author says that's not true.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. Forgetting once is understandable, especially under stress. The key points are: the child usually has her diaper changed regularly, this was an exception. The author was in the middle of making dinner when they realized. The husband might have overreacted by getting angry and throwing something, which seems more like his issue. The author didn't intentionally leave the kid in a dirty diaper for 5 hours. The husband's reaction seems excessive, especially if the time estimate is incorrect. Also, the author tried to explain but was cut off. The husband's claim about being disrespectful because he got covered in pee seems a bit much, as it's part of parenting responsibilities.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was forgetting, but it's a one-time thing. The husband's reaction might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't in the wrong because everyone can have a bad day. The answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
