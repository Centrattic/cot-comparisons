Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, which led to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and wearing a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper after a stressful day while making dinner. The husband came home, and the parent asked him to change the diaper. He did, but got angry because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The parent claims it wasn't for 5 hours as the husband said and that they were stressed. The husband felt it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nSo, the main points are: the parent forgot once, it's not a regular occurrence, and the husband overreacted by being angry and possibly yelling. The parent left because they didn't want to argue. \n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The parent made a mistake but it's a one-time thing under stress. The husband is taking it out on them, maybe exaggerating the time frame and calling it disrespectful. The parent tried to explain but was cut off. \n\nThe parent isn't in the wrong for a one-time oversight, especially with a toddler who's potty training. The husband's reaction seems excessive. The parent isn't neglectful; it's a slip-up. The husband's behavior of getting angry and yelling is the issue here. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the mistake was minor and the husband's reaction is the real problem.\n"
