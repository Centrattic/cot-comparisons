Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their toddler's diaper, leading to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and uses pull-ups. The parent forgot to change the diaper, and the husband ended up changing her after being asked. The husband was upset, even throwing or kicking something, and the parent felt he was yelling. The parent mentions it's not a regular occurrence and that the day was stressful, leading to a lapse in remembering.\n\nNow, evaluating if the parent is at fault. The key points here are the frequency of the issue and the context. Since it's stated that this doesn't happen ever, and the parent usually takes care of diaper changes, the mistake is an exception. The stress of the day and being in the middle of making dinner could be valid reasons for a slip-up. However, the parent did ask the husband to help, which shows they recognized the need to address it but couldn't at that moment. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh, especially claiming the diaper was left for 5 hours (which the parent disputes) and feeling disrespected. The parent's explanation was cut off, indicating poor communication. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and the parent's avoidance of confrontation might suggest that the husband is overreacting. \n\nConsidering typical responsibilities in parenting, both parents share in childcare. The parent didn't neglect the task entirely; they simply forgot once due to circumstances. The husband's response, however, seems disproportionate. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
