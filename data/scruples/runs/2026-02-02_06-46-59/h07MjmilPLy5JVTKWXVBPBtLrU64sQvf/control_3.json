Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old who was in a pull-up. The mom forgot to change her during a stressful day while making dinner. The husband was home, wrestling with the kid, and then she asked him to change the diaper. He got angry, threw something, and they had a conflict.\n\nFirst, the key points: The daughter is 2.5, which is old for diapers, but they use pull-ups. The mom didn't change her for a while, leading to a full diaper and some wet clothes. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The husband was wrestling with the child before, then she asked him to change the diaper. He got angry, maybe even yelling. The mom feels she's being yelled at, while he denies it. The background is that this never happens before, and it was a particularly stressful day.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Let's think about the responsibilities. As a parent, changing a child's diaper is a shared responsibility, especially when the other parent is home. However, the mom was in the middle of making dinner, which is a common task. She might have been distracted. The husband was wrestling with the child, which could have been a good time to check the diaper, but he didn't. The mom realized and asked him to change it, but maybe she should have done it herself instead of delegating? Or is it okay to ask?\n\nThe husband's reaction seems exaggerated. Getting angry over a wet diaper and feeling covered in pee is a bit much. The mom's mistake was forgetting, but it's a one-time incident, not a recurring problem. The husband's behavior of throwing something and being angry might be the bigger issue here. Also, the mom left the situation because arguments are common, which shows she's aware of their communication problems.\n\nSo, is the mom in the wrong? Probably not. She forgot once due to stress, and the husband overreacted. The responsibility for diaper changes isn't clearly outlined, but asking the partner to help is normal. The husband's anger and the throwing something are problematic. The mom isn't the asshole here.\n"
