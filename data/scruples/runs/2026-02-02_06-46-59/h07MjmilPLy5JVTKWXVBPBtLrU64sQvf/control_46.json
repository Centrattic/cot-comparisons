Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and using a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as regular diapers. The author was making dinner when they realized they forgot to change her. They asked the husband to do it, then later the husband got angry, saying the diaper was really full and the clothes were wet. The author says the husband claims it was 5 hours, which isn't true. The author felt the husband was yelling, but he says he wasn't. The background is that this doesn't usually happen, and it was a stressful day.\n\nFirst, the key points: The child is 2.5, so she's likely in pull-ups but still might need changes. The author forgot, which is understandable if they were busy making dinner. The husband was asked to change it, but then he got angry. The author says the husband is exaggerating the time (5 hours vs. reality). The husband feels disrespected because he got wet and angry. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while isn't necessarily wrong, especially if it's not a common occurrence. The author mentions it's not something that happens, so it's an isolated incident. Stressful days can lead to lapses. The child's comfort is important, but the author realized the mistake and tried to get help. However, they might have been preoccupied, which is a common issue in parenting. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems exaggerated. He kicked something out of anger, which is unproductive. He's upset about being covered in pee, but that seems more about his own discomfort than the child's well-being. The author left because they didn't want to argue, which is a valid choice to avoid conflict. \n\nThe husband's claim that the author left her for 5 hours is disputed. If it was less, then the husband's accusation is false, which contributes to the conflict. The author's actions might not be in the wrong, especially since they acknowledged the mistake and tried to fix it. The husband's response is more aggressive and perhaps holding them to an unrealistic standard, especially if it's a rare occurrence.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The wrong here is more on the husband's overreaction. The answer should be B.\n"
