Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, which led to some conflict with their husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent (the author) forgot to change her diaper after the husband got home. The husband was supposed to wrestle with her, and the author asked him to change it. Then, after the diaper was full and the clothes got wet, the husband became angry. The author says this is not typical, and the husband's reaction included yelling and making a scene. The author left because they don't want to argue.\n\nNow, considering the responsibilities. Both parents usually share responsibilities. The author was in the middle of cooking when they realized the mistake. The husband took over, but there was a conflict. The author's excuse is that it was a particularly stressful day and they lost track of time. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the author disputes that. The husband felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgetting to change a diaper once, even with a child in pull-ups, isn't a huge issue if it's a one-time thing. The author admits it's not usual. However, the husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The author didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was an oversight. On the other hand, maybe the author should have changed it themselves when they realized, but they asked the husband, which is a shared responsibility.\n\nThe husband's actions (throwing/kicking something, getting angry) are problematic. The author left to avoid arguing, which suggests the husband's behavior is more about the argument than the actual incident. The key here is whether the author's mistake was inexcusable or if the husband overreacted. Since the author tried to explain and it was a one-off, it's more likely the husband is overreacting, so the author isn't the asshole. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
