Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent forgot to change her diaper, leading to a wet situation when the husband tried to help.\n\nFirst, considering the child's well-being: 2.5-year-olds can be trained to use the toilet, so relying on pull-ups might be part of potty training. If the parent is responsible for diaper changes and forgot, maybe there's a neglect aspect? But the user mentions it's not usual, and they were cooking dinner, which is a valid distraction. Stressful day might explain the lapse. However, the child's hygiene is important, so missing a change could be seen as a mistake, especially if it's not a one-off. But the user says it's not something that happens ever.\n\nThen, the husband's reaction: he got angry, maybe overreacted by yelling and throwing things. The user left to avoid arguing. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours (user says not true). The user's excuse is the stressful day and multitasking. The husband felt disrespected because he got covered in pee. But if the parent is the main caregiver, expecting the spouse to handle unexpected messes might be part of shared parenting.\n\nIs the user at fault? If they're usually responsible and had a valid reason (stress, cooking), maybe not. But if they consistently neglected this, it would be a problem. The husband's reaction is also questionable. But the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user made a mistake, but it's a single incident due to stress. The husband's overreaction might be more to blame here. So the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
