Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, leading to some conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, many kids are potty training, so using a pull-up might be part of the process. The mother forgot to change the diaper, which led to the child's clothes getting wet. The husband changed the diaper but got angry, claiming she left it for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful. The mother says it wasn't that long and that the stress of the day caused her to lose track of time.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the mother neglect the child's basic needs? Well, the diaper was full, and the child's clothes were wet. But the mother was in the middle of making dinner when she realized. The husband assisted, which is a good thing. However, his reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling, calling it disrespectful, and overestimating the time the diaper was left. \n\nThe mother's intention wasn't to be neglectful. She was stressed and distracted. The husband's anger might stem from frustration, but his actions (throwing/kicking something) and harsh words could be disproportionate. The fact that the mother didn't make this a habit (she says it's not something that happens ever) suggests it was an isolated incident due to stress. \n\nIs the mother in the wrong? Possibly not. Everyone forgets things, especially when stressed. The husband's reaction seems more extreme. However, if the diaper was left for an extended period causing discomfort, maybe there's a point. But the mother's intent wasn't malicious. So, probably the husband overreacted. \n\nThe answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the situation was a mistake under stress, not neglect. The husband's reaction is the bigger issue here.\n"
