Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. \n\nFirst, the context: The daughter is 2.5, so she's in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The author was making dinner when they realized they hadn't changed her in a while. The husband was home and wrestling with the child before being asked to change the diaper. He got angry, threw something, and later claims she left her in it for 5 hours, which the author denies. The husband also felt \"covered in pee\" from the wet clothes.\n\nThe author says this isn't a regular occurrence and that the day was stressful, leading to a time slip. They were in the middle of cooking when they noticed. The husband is upset about the mess and the author not taking responsibility. The author left because arguing is common and they didn't want to face yelling.\n\nNow, considering if the author is at fault. The key points are: Did they neglect the child's needs? The child is young and needs regular diaper changes. Forgetting once, especially under stress, might be understandable. However, a 2.5-year-old might be potty training, so maybe the expectation is different. The author admits they were busy but didn't mention any immediate harm to the child. The husband's reaction seems excessive, especially the physical action of throwing something. \n\nThe author wasn't intentionally neglectful; it was a slip due to stress. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and clothes might be overreacting. The author tried to explain, but the husband dismissed the excuse. The main issue is the husband's reaction rather than the author's mistake. Since the author didn't intentionally neglect and it's a one-time event, they're probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
