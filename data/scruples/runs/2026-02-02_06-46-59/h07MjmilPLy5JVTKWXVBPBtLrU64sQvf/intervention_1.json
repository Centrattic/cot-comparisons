Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using a pull-up. The husband was home after wrestling with the kid, and the author asked him to change the diaper. Then the husband got angry, saying she didn't have an excuse and that he was covered in pee because the clothes were wet.\n\nFirst, the author admits they forgot to change the diaper. But they mention that this isn't something that usually happens. They were stressed and making dinner when the incident occurred. The husband claims it was 5 hours, which the author disputes. The husband got upset, maybe yelling, and the author left to avoid an argument.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, forgetting to change a diaper is a mistake, but it's not a huge deal if it's a one-time thing. However, a 2.5-year-old should be potty-trained, right? If she's using pull-ups, maybe she's on the verge of being fully potty-trained. So, the author might be responsible for ensuring she's not left in a soiled diaper. But the husband was there and the author asked him to change it, so maybe the author was trying to get help. The husband then got angry, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are the frequency of such incidents. The author says this never happens, so it was an oversight. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate, but the author did ask him to change the diaper. However, the author left the child in a situation where the diaper got full and clothes got wet. But again, it's a single instance. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration. Still, the author was cooking, which is a valid task, and the stress of the day might have led to the forgetfulness.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share in child-rearing. The author asked the husband to help, which is a normal way to share duties. The husband's anger and the accusation that the author is at fault for a one-time mistake might be unwarranted. The author isn't being neglectful if it's a rare occurrence. The husband's reaction could be the real issue here, but the question is about the author's fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author made a mistake, but it was a one-off and they tried to involve the husband. The husband's overreaction is part of the problem. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the author should be more careful, but the situation seems more like a miscommunication. So, probably B.\n"
