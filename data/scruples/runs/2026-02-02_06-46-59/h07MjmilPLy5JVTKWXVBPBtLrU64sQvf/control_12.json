Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves forgetting to change their daughter's diaper for a while, leading to some conflict with their husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her, and when they realized, they asked the husband to help. The husband then got angry, saying she left the child in the diaper for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The parent argues that it wasn't true they waited 5 hours and that it was a stressful day when they lost track of time. They mention that this is not a regular occurrence and that the husband's reaction was harsh.\n\nSo, assessing if the parent is in the wrong. Forgetting once in a while, especially during a stressful day, seems understandable. The parent did ask the husband for help once they realized the mistake. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate\u2014yelling, throwing/kicking something, and being upset over a minor incident. The parent left because arguing is common and they didn't want to be yelled at. \n\nFrom a general perspective, occasional lapses happen, and expecting a partner to handle a diaper change isn't unreasonable. The husband's accusation of disrespect and the exaggerated duration (5 hours) might be an overreaction. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
