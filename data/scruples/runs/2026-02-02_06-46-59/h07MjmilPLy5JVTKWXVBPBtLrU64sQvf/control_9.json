Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old, in a pull-up, and the parent forgot to change her diaper. The husband got home, the parent asked him to change it, but then there was some conflict when he found out the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The parent says it was a stressful day and they lost track of time, while the husband is upset, thinking it was disrespectful and that the parent left it for 5 hours (which they deny).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. At 2.5, children are usually potty training or at least starting to use the potty. However, pull-ups are sometimes used during training accidents. The parent says it doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. If the child was in a pull-up and it leaked, maybe the parent thought it would be okay a bit longer, but clearly, it wasn't. However, the parent did realize the mistake and asked the husband to change it. The husband getting angry might be overreacting, but maybe he felt it was a neglectful act. The parent says it's not something that happens ever, so it's an exception due to stress.\n\nThe parent was making dinner when they realized, so maybe they were busy. But changing a child's diaper is a basic need, so if they were too busy, perhaps they should have prioritized it. However, the parent did ask the husband to help once they realized. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if the parent was already asking for help. The parent leaving the room to avoid arguing might be their way of handling conflict, but that doesn't mean they're wrong about the situation.\n\nThe husband's claim that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee is a bit odd. If the parent had changed it, he wouldn't have been in that situation. Also, the parent says the husband was yelling, but he says he wasn't. The parent is trying to explain the stress of the day, which is a common reason people make mistakes. The husband's anger over a one-time incident might be unwarranted, especially if the parent is usually responsible.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should share the load. The parent asked the husband to help, so maybe the issue isn't about the diaper not being changed, but how the husband reacted. The parent isn't wrong for forgetting once, especially given the context. So the answer would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
