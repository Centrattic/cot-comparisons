Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, and the husband getting angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups which don't hold as much pee. The mother was making dinner when she realized she forgot to change her diaper. She asked her husband to help, and he ended up upset because the diaper was full and the child's clothes were wet. He claims she left it for 5 hours (which she denies), and that she was disrespectful because he got covered in pee. The mother says this is not a regular occurrence and that the day was stressful, leading her to lose track of time.\n\nThe mother is asking if she's the asshole here. The user initially thinks she is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. \n\nNow, to evaluate the situation. Forgetting to change a child's diaper is not a common mistake, especially if it's not a regular thing. However, 2.5-year-olds can hold their urine for longer than diapers, so maybe a pull-up wasn't the best choice. But the mother was busy making dinner and had a stressful day. She did realize the mistake and asked her partner to help, which shows she was trying to correct it. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh. He got angry, kicked something, and was upset about being covered in pee. His claim that she left it for 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The mother left because she didn't want to argue, indicating past issues with their communication. \n\nThe key points here are the intent and the context. The mother didn't intentionally forget; it was a lapse due to stress. The husband's reaction might be over the top, especially if the mistake wasn't intentional and is a one-time thing. The husband could have handled it more calmly instead of getting angry. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents might share some duty in caring for the child. The mother was in the middle of a task, and the husband could have stepped in earlier if he noticed the child needed a change. However, since the mother asked for help once she realized, the immediate blame isn't on her. \n\nThe husband's claim about disrespect because he got covered in pee seems a bit trivial. Parents often handle messy situations, and expecting the other not to get any mess on them might be unrealistic. His anger over a wet diaper and clothes might be disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. The husband's overreaction and the specific circumstances (stressful day, one-time mistake) suggest that the blame isn't on her. The answer would be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
