Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. So, the situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old, and the author forgot to change her diaper when she was in a pull-up. The husband was home and the author asked him to change it, but when he did, he got angry because the diaper was really full and there was some mess. The husband claims it was disrespectful, and the author feels they're arguing over a wet diaper. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that this is not a regular occurrence. The daughter usually has her diaper changed regularly, but due to a stressful day, the author forgot while making dinner. The husband says she left it for 5 hours, but the author disputes that. The husband got upset, maybe even kicked something, and took the daughter to the shower. The author left because they didn't want to argue.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author did ask the husband to change the diaper, but maybe they didn't check if he was ready or available. However, the main issue is that the diaper wasn't changed. For a 2.5-year-old, staying in a dirty diaper for a long time isn't just about being clean\u2014it's about comfort and preventing skin irritation. So, if the author forgot, maybe that's a lapse, but given the stress of the day, it's understandable. \n\nBut the husband's reaction seems over the top. He's angry about being covered in pee, but he was the one who changed the diaper. Maybe the author should have changed it earlier, but if the husband took over, then his frustration about the mess seems a bit much. Also, the author left to avoid arguing, which shows they don't want conflict. \n\nThe husband's claim that the author left it for 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The author might have forgotten, but it's possible the time wasn't that long. The fact that the daughter was in a pull-up, which isn't as absorbent as a regular diaper, could mean she needed a change more frequently. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share duties, and asking the husband to help is reasonable. However, if the author was in the middle of cooking and forgot, maybe they should have set a reminder or asked for help earlier. But given that it's not a regular issue, it's more of a one-time mistake. \n\nThe husband's anger and the claim of disrespect seem unwarranted. The author was trying to manage dinner, which is a common household task. The husband's reaction might stem from stress or frustration, but yelling over a wet diaper is extreme. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They made a mistake due to a stressful day, but it's an isolated incident. The husband's overreaction is more concerning. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
