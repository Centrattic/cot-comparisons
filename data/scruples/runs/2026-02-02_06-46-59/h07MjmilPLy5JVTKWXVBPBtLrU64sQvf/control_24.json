Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a parent) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was wearing a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much. The husband got home, the mom forgot to change the diaper, asked him to do it, then he got angry because the diaper was full and the kid's clothes were wet. The mom says this is not usual and that the husband exaggerated the time she left it on. The mom left the room because she didn't want to argue.\n\nFirst, 2.5 years old is old enough to use the potty, but maybe the child still uses pull-ups sometimes. The mom forgot, which can happen. She asked her husband to help, which is a reasonable request. The husband got angry and reacted strongly, even throwing or kicking something. The mom says he was yelling, he says he wasn't. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The mom didn't neglect the child; it was an oversight. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and being covered in pee seems like an overreaction. The mom left because they argue a lot, which suggests the husband might have a pattern of harsh reactions.\n\nSo, the main points: the mom didn't intentionally neglect the child, it was a one-time slip-up, the husband's reaction was extreme. The answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The husband is in the wrong for overreacting and being angry over a minor issue.\n"
