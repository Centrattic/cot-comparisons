Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. So the scenario is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, and the husband gets upset about it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2 1/2 years old. At that age, many kids are in pull-ups and starting to use the potty. The author was in the middle of making dinner when she realized she hadn't changed the diaper in a while. She asked the husband to do it, but he ended up being angry, even though she says this is not a regular occurrence. The husband claims she left the diaper on for 5 hours, which she denies. He's upset because he got covered in pee and feels disrespected. The author left the room to avoid an argument.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nFrom the author's side: She forgot once due to a stressful day and being busy with dinner. She immediately asked her husband for help. The fact that this is a rare occurrence suggests it's not a pattern of neglect. Also, a 2 1/2-year-old is old enough to be in pull-ups, which are designed to handle some mess, but they don't hold as much as regular diapers. If the child's clothes were wet, that's an accident, but the author didn't intend harm. She tried to explain but was cut off, leading her to leave to avoid conflict.\n\nOn the husband's side: He's upset that the author didn't change the diaper, leading to a mess and him getting covered in pee. He claims it was disrespectful. However, he's the one who took the child for a shower, so maybe he's handling the situation. His reaction seems a bit over the top, especially if it's a one-time mistake. Yelling or anger over a diaper mishap seems excessive, especially if the author is usually reliable.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's mistake was a one-time thing due to a busy day. She took responsibility by asking her husband to help. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The author leaving the room to avoid argument might be a sign of wanting to de-escalate, not an admission of guilt. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The main issue is the husband's overreaction rather than the author's mistake. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n"
