Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper. The kid is 2.5 years old, so they're using pull-ups. The parent (the author) was making dinner when the husband came home. The husband had been playing with the kid (wrestling), and the author asked him to change the diaper. Then the husband got angry, threw something, and later the diaper was full, and the kid's clothes were wet. The author mentions that this is not a regular occurrence and that the day was stressful.\n\nFirst, the author forgot to change the diaper, which led to the kid having a full pull-up and some wet clothes. The husband took over, got upset, and the author felt attacked. The husband claims she left the diaper for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The author left it because she was busy making dinner, which makes sense, but she admits she lost track of time due to stress. \n\nNow, the key points here: Is the author at fault for not changing the diaper? Well, 2.5-year-olds are in the process of potty training. If they're using pull-ups, maybe they're still not fully trained. The parent's job is to monitor and change them regularly. However, the author says this is not a usual thing and that she usually does it. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling, which might be the bigger issue here. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Did she do something wrong by not changing the diaper? Well, she was busy, stressed, and forgot. But the responsibility of changing a toddler's diaper is part of parenting. Even if she was busy, she should have found a way to manage. Maybe she could have asked the husband earlier, or set a reminder. However, she did ask him to change it when she realized. So maybe she's not entirely wrong. But the husband's reaction seems excessive. \n\nThe husband's claim that she left it for 5 hours might be an exaggeration. If the author says it's not true, maybe he's overreacting. The fact that the author left the kitchen to avoid an argument suggests she felt belittled. The husband was covered in pee, which could be gross, but the main issue was the emotional response. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because everyone makes mistakes, especially with a young child. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. However, the author did forget to change the diaper, which is a parental responsibility. But given that it's a one-time slip-up and not a regular thing, maybe the husband is overreacting. \n\nThe key here is that the author was in the middle of cooking and had a stressful day. She tried to delegate the task to her husband. The husband's anger and yelling are the bigger issues. The author's mistake was a momentary lapse, not a pattern. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
