Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband got home, the author asked him to change it, but then there was some conflict.\n\nFirst, the child is 2.5, so she's probably using pull-ups. The author forgot to change her, and the husband ended up doing it. The husband got angry, saying she left her in it for 5 hours (which she denies). The author mentions that the day was stressful and she lost track of time while making dinner. The husband felt disrespected because he got covered in pee from the wet clothes.\n\nThe key points here: The author didn't mean to neglect the child. It was a one-time slip-up due to a stressful day and being busy. She asked her husband to handle it once she realized. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. Forgetting once in a while isn't uncommon, especially with a young child. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration. Also, the author left the room to avoid arguing, which shows she's trying to de-escalate the situation.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's anger seems over the top. The main issue here is the husband's reaction rather than the author's mistake. The answer should be B.\n"
