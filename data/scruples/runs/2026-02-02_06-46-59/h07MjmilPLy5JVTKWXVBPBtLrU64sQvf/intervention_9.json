Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper for a while, leading to some conflict with their husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mother was making dinner when she realized she had forgotten to change the diaper. The husband was home and wrestling with the daughter, so she asked him to change it. He did, but got angry, claiming she left it for 5 hours and was disrespectful. She left because she didn't want to argue.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, forgetting to change a diaper isn't uncommon, especially if the child is in pull-ups. The mother mentions it's not something that happens often, and it was a particularly stressful day. She was in the middle of cooking when she realized. The husband might feel responsible for the mess and upset about being covered in pee. However, the mother did ask him to change it when she noticed, so maybe she took initiative once she realized it. \n\nOn the other hand, leaving a child in a wet diaper for a long time could cause discomfort, and the husband might have felt that the mother should have taken responsibility earlier. But the mother argues that the husband exaggerated the time (5 hours vs actual time), which could show that he's overreacting. Also, the husband's reaction of yelling and throwing things might make the situation worse, and the mother leaving to avoid the argument could be a reasonable choice.\n\nThe key points are: frequency of such incidents (never before), the stress of the day, the mother's attempt to delegate when she noticed, and the husband's reaction. The question is whether the mother is at fault for forgetting once, or if the husband overreacted. \n\nSince the mother didn't make it a habit and acted when she realized, it's more about a one-time mistake. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if it wasn't a 5-hour period. So maybe the mother isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
