Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper for a while, leading to some conflict with the husband. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and using pull-ups. The parent forgot to change her diaper, which is unusual for them. The husband was wrestling with the daughter earlier and then got angry when the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The parent tried to explain but was cut off. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, which the parent denies. The parent left the situation because arguing is common and they didn't want more conflict.\n\nNow, considering if the parent is at fault. The daughter usually has her diaper changed regularly. This was a one-time slip due to a stressful day and being busy with dinner. The parent didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was an oversight. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate\u2014getting angry over a diaper situation that's not typical. The parent's excuse about being in the middle of cooking might be valid, especially since the child is used to having her diaper changed regularly. The husband's claim about being covered in pee is a bit harsh since he was the one handling the situation after the fact.\n\nBut, the parent did ask the husband to change the diaper, and he did so, then became upset. The parent's decision to leave the situation because they don't want to argue is understandable. However, maybe the parent could have handled the explanation better, but the main issue is the husband's overreaction. The key points are that this was a rare mistake due to stress, not a pattern, and the parent is not intentionally neglecting the child. So the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
