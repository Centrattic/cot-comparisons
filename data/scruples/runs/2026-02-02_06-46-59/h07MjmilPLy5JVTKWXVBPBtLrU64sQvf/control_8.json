Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a mom forgetting to change her daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's using pull-ups. The husband came home and the mom was making dinner. She asked him to change the diaper, but then he got angry when the diaper was full and her clothes were wet. The mom says it's not something that happens often and that the stress of the day made her forget. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. He also got upset about being covered in pee.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the mom was wrong. Forgetting things can happen to anyone, especially with the stress mentioned. She was in the middle of making dinner when she realized the mistake. The daughter is 2.5, so maybe she can communicate a bit, but maybe not. The mom did ask her husband to help, which is a reasonable action. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. He got angry, maybe even yelled, and the mom felt it was an argument. The husband's claim about 5 hours seems exaggerated. Also, the fact that the clothes were wet might be a minor issue compared to the emotional response. The mom is not trying to be irresponsible; this was a one-time mistake. The husband's reaction of being \"disrespectful\" because of being covered in pee seems a bit harsh. So, putting it all together, the mom isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
