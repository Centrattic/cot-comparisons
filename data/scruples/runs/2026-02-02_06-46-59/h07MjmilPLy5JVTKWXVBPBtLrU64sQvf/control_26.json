Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The mother was making dinner when she realized she hadn't changed the diaper in a while. She asked her husband to help, and he did, but then he got angry and acted out by throwing something. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The mother says that's not true and that it was a stressful day where she just lost track of time.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if not changing the diaper was the mother's fault. The daughter is 2.5, which is an age where they're starting to use the potty. If she's in a pull-up, maybe she's in the process of potty training. However, the mother did forget, which is unusual for her. She was in the middle of making dinner and had a stressful day. So maybe she genuinely forgot. The husband's reaction seems harsh. He got angry and threw something, which is a red flag. Yelling is also an issue, even if he says he wasn't yelling. Arguing is a common problem between them, which adds context.\n\nThe husband's claim that she left it for 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The mother says it's not true. Without knowing the actual time, it's hard to say, but if it's not a usual occurrence and the mother forgot once, maybe the husband's reaction is disproportionate. The husband also seems to be blaming her for the mess he ended up with, but since he was the one who changed the diaper and got covered in pee, maybe he's taking responsibility for the cleanup. However, that's not necessarily the mother's fault; she asked him to help, so he was volunteering.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's forgetfulness due to a stressful day and the husband's overreaction. The mother didn't intentionally neglect her child. The husband's anger and anger management (throwing things) are concerning. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong. Since she forgot once, under stress, and the husband's reaction is extreme, the answer might be B, not the author. But I need to check if there's any fault on her part. Not changing a diaper when needed is a parental responsibility, but if she was distracted and it's an exceptional case, maybe it's not her fault. The husband's behavior is more problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
