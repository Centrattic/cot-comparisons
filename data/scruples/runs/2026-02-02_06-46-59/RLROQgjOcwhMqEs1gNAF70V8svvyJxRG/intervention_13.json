He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the post) is in the wrong for not keeping their husband undisturbed while he works from home in their bedroom. The husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, even though the basement is more suitable for quiet. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so when he's in the bedroom, the wife has to manage the kids and avoid making noise, which limits her ability to do household tasks and even basic self-care.\n\nThe wife suggested the basement for his office, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. She argues that by staying in the bedroom, he's making it impossible for her to work and manage the household. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but can in the basement, hence her refusal to let him work there. He's upset because he thinks she's being the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband has the option to work in the basement, which is quieter and less disruptive. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating the situation that causes the wife to have to restrict her activities. The wife is managing the household and her own work from home, which is already a lot. The fact that he's in the bedroom complicates her tasks. She's trying to set boundaries by offering the basement as a solution, but he's not taking it. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to more disruption for the wife. She's not the one creating the problem; the husband's decision does that. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for not allowing him to work in the bedroom if it causes her significant inconvenience. The husband could have chosen the basement to minimize disruption. The wife's stance is about maintaining her own ability to function, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband made the choice that leads to the disruption, and the wife is justified in setting boundaries based on that choice.\n"
