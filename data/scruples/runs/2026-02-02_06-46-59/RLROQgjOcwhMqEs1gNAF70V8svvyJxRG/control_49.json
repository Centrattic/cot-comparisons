He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, which causes disruptions because he's on a lot of calls. The wife suggested the basement instead, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, she's struggling with managing the kids and household tasks while he's working in the bedroom, leading to conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement, which is quieter. His job requires being undisturbed during calls, which he expects her to manage. However, the wife is also working from home and handling most of the housework and childcare. By setting up in the bedroom, he's limiting her ability to do her own work and take care of chores, which affects her productivity and well-being.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The husband's choice to use the bedroom despite a better alternative (basement) causing disruptions. 2) The wife's responsibilities are being hindered. 3) The husband expects her to keep the kids and household quiet, but her ability to do her own tasks is restricted.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband's decision impacts the wife's ability to function effectively. The basement was a viable option that would have minimized disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's prioritizing his preference (view) over practicality and shared responsibilities. The wife is not at fault for not keeping him undisturbed if he's in a shared space that's not the designated quiet area. The husband should have considered the household dynamics and chosen the basement to avoid conflicts. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong, making the author (wife) not the asshole.\n"
