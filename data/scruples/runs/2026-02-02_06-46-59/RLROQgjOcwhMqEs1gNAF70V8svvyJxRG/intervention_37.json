He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, even though the wife suggested the basement. Now, the wife is struggling because she can't do basic things like shower or take a nap because he's on conference calls. She works from home too and handles most chores and kids. The husband says she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. The wife is now dealing with the consequences of that choice. The husband's job is mostly calls, so he needs silence. However, by choosing the bedroom, he's limiting the wife's ability to use the top floor, including their shared bathroom and doing chores. She works from home and has kids, so her time is limited. The husband is not willing to move to the basement for better soundproofing, and the wife can't guarantee silence in the bedroom. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants to know if that's correct. \n\nThe husband made a choice to set up in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion. The wife is now being inconvenienced. In a shared living space, it's important to respect each other's needs. If the husband insisted on the bedroom, he should be willing to accept the trade-offs, like maybe some noise. However, the wife is also responsible for managing the household and her own work. If she can't function because the husband's setup is in the bedroom, that's a problem. \n\nThe wife's request for him to move to the basement is reasonable because it would minimize disruptions. The husband is refusing despite the wife's valid concerns. The wife is not being asked to be silent; she's being asked to adjust to a setup that's causing her significant inconvenience. The husband's argument that she's the asshole for not being quiet seems to ignore that he's the one who chose the location. \n\nSo, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. The husband made a choice that affects her daily life without considering the consequences. The wife is trying to find a compromise by suggesting the basement, which is a reasonable solution. The husband's refusal makes him the one at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
