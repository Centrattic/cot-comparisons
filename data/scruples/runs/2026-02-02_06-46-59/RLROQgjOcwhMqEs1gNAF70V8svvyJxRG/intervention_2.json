He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, leading to disruptions for the wife. She can't do basic things like shower or nap because he's on calls. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, but he's working there anyway.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. The author is the wife, right? She suggested the basement, which is quieter. But the husband chose the bedroom. Now she's saying she can't promise he'll be undisturbed, which he knew going in. So maybe he's making a choice that impacts her work and household duties.\n\nBut wait, the wife is the one who works from home and handles most chores and kids. If the husband is in the bedroom, it's causing her to have to manage everything else without being able to take a break. The husband is the one who didn't take the basement option that would minimize disruption. So maybe the husband is in the wrong for not moving to the basement, which the wife suggested. The wife is being honest about the trade-offs. \n\nThe user is the wife, and she's saying that since he's in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence, which he already accepted. But he's upset she's not keeping it quiet. But she's doing most of the work. So maybe the husband is the one in the wrong for choosing an inconvenient location. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
