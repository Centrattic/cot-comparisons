He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the husband switched jobs and now can work from home a few days a week. He set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, which the wife suggested because it would be quieter. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife has to manage the kids and housework while he's in the bedroom. She can't shower, do chores, take a nap, etc. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and childcare. The wife told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but if he went to the basement, they'd never disturb him. He's upset because he thinks she should be quiet when he's on calls, but she thinks he's wrong for not going to the basement.\n\nSo the main issue is where the office is located. The wife is trying to balance work and family responsibilities, and the husband's choice is making her life harder. The key points are: the husband's preference for the bedroom's view vs. the basement's silence, the wife's inability to manage her tasks, and the fact that she works from home too. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The wife is standing her ground, arguing that he should move to the basement. She's not disturbing him when he's in the basement, but when he's in the bedroom, it's hard to keep everyone quiet. The husband is frustrated because he wants to work in the bedroom. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband chose a location that's more convenient for him (better view), but this causes issues for the wife. The wife has valid reasons for suggesting the basement. She's working, managing the household, and dealing with kids. It's a shared responsibility, but the husband's setup is limiting her ability to do her job and manage the home. \n\nI think the husband is being self-centered here. While he needs to work, he could have chosen the basement to minimize disruptions. The wife isn't at fault for pushing him to move. She can't control the kids or the baby's schedule, so expecting her to be completely silent is unrealistic. The husband should consider her situation and compromise. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
