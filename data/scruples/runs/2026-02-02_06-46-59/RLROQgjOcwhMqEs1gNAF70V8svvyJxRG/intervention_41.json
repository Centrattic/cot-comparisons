He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts with the wife's ability to manage household tasks and work.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom over the basement. The wife suggested the basement for less disruption, but he preferred the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife is handling most of the housework, childcare, and also works from home. Because he's in the bedroom, she can't use the top floor, including the bathroom, which affects her work and chores.\n\nThe husband argues the wife is the problem for not being quiet, while she thinks he's at fault for not using the basement. The key points here are about mutual responsibility and compromise. The husband has a choice of workspace but opted for the bedroom despite knowing it would cause issues. The wife tried to suggest an alternative that would minimize disruption but he refused. Now, his presence in the bedroom restricts her movement and productivity.\n\nIn terms of fairness, when one person's choice significantly impacts another's daily life, especially when alternatives exist, it's reasonable to expect some compromise. The husband's decision to prioritize his view over the wife's ability to function seems to be a point of contention. The wife's job and household responsibilities are being hindered, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, the author (wife) is not in the wrong because she's standing up for her needs and suggesting a solution that benefits both. The husband's choice to stay in the bedroom, despite the alternative, is the root of the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
