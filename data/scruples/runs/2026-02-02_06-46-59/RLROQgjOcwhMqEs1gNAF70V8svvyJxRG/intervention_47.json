He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts with the wife who has to manage the kids and household tasks.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement. The basement is quieter and would presumably cause less disruption. The wife is struggling because when he's in the bedroom, the whole top floor becomes off-limits, affecting her ability to do chores, take a shower, or even nap. She's also working from home and handling most of the childcare.\n\nThe key point here is the husband's choice to prioritize his own comfort (better view) over practicality and household efficiency. The wife is essentially left without a private space because the bedroom is his office. She's trying to balance work and home responsibilities, which are being hindered by his setup. The husband's refusal to move to the basement, which is more suitable, seems like a self-centered decision that doesn't consider her needs.\n\nWhile it's true that both partners need to accommodate each other, the husband's choice to work in a space that causes such significant disruption for his wife is problematic. The wife isn't the one creating the problem; she's reacting to his decision. So, the husband's initial choice is the root of the issue. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in a space that wasn't the best choice to begin with.\n"
