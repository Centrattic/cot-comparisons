He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who set up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles most of the household and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement because of the view, even though the basement is quieter. The wife is struggling because when he's on calls in the bedroom, she can't use the top floor for her own needs, like showering, doing chores, or napping. She suggested the basement, which is more suitable for an office. He's upset that she's not keeping it quiet in the bedroom, while she feels he's being unreasonable by not choosing the basement.\n\nSo, the main points are about space usage and mutual needs. Both work from home and have childcare responsibilities. The husband's choice affects the wife's ability to function. The wife made a compromise by suggesting the basement, which he rejected. Now she's setting boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. He's upset with her for not being quiet, but she's upset he didn't take the basement.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (wife) is in the wrong, but I need to decide. From a fairness perspective, the husband had the option to choose the basement for a quieter environment, which would have avoided the conflict. By choosing the bedroom, he's imposing his preference on the wife, who can't control the kids or her own needs. The wife is trying to balance both work and home, so she's setting boundaries. It seems like the husband's choice is the root of the problem. Therefore, the wife is not in the wrong. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
