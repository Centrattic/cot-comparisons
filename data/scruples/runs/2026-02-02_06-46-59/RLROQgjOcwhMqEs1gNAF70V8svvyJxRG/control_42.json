He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who has to manage kids, chores, and her own work. The wife suggested the basement but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now she's frustrated because she can't do basic things when he's on calls there.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's choice to work from the bedroom might be for his comfort, but it's creating a conflict. The wife is handling most of the household tasks and childcare, which is a lot. By setting up in the bedroom, he's limiting her access to that space, which affects her ability to work and manage the house. \n\nThe key points here are about shared space and mutual consideration. Even though he's working, the bedroom is a shared area. She's trying to balance work and home responsibilities. The husband's preference for the view shouldn't override her need to use the space. The wife's suggestion to use the basement was practical, and by ignoring it, he's causing the problem. \n\nThe wife isn't being unreasonable by not keeping the bedroom undisturbed when there are kids and chores. It's a normal household activity. The husband's work setup is interfering with her daily life. So, the husband might be the one at fault here. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the husband's choice is causing the issue, not her trying to manage the household.\n"
