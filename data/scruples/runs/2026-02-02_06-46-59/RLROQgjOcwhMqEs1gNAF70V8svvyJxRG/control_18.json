He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is the asshole (AITA) for not letting her husband work undisturbed in their bedroom.\n\nFirst, the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The basement is quieter and has less disruption, but he chose the bedroom for the view. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife is handling the kids, chores, and her own work, and his setup is making it hard for her to do basic things like shower or nap when the baby is sleeping. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but promised not to disturb him in the basement. He's upset she's not being quiet, while she's upset he's not using the basement.\n\nHmm, the husband made a choice that affects the wife's daily life. He prefers the bedroom for comfort (the view), but that's causing major disruptions. The wife is taking on a lot of responsibilities and his choice is limiting her ability to manage the household and her own work. It seems like he should have considered the practicality of the basement. The wife is trying to communicate her needs, but he's not compromising. \n\nSo the question is, is the wife wrong for not keeping him undisturbed in the bedroom? Well, she's not the one causing the disruptions\u2014her kids and the need to handle chores are. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom is the root cause. She's trying to balance her responsibilities while he's in the same space that's supposed to be quiet. Since he's the one who chose the less practical location, maybe the wife isn't at fault. The answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
