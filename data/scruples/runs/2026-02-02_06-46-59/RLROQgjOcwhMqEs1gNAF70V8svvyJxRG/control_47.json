He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works and handles the kids and chores.\n\nFirst, the husband moved his office to the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The wife feels she can't use the top floor, can't shower, do chores, etc. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, so he should take the basement. He's upset she's not being quiet, while she thinks he's at fault for choosing the bedroom. \n\nNow, to determine if the author (the wife) is wrong. The question is whether her actions are justified. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to her being restricted in her own home. She has responsibilities with kids and chores, and her ability to work is also affected. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband had an alternative (basement) that would minimize disruption. By choosing the bedroom, he's imposing restrictions on her. The wife is being honest about her inability to maintain silence if he's in the bedroom. She's not trying to disrupt him; she's managing their household. So, the husband might be at fault for not considering the impact on her, but the wife isn't in the wrong for holding him to that. \n\nThe key points are mutual work obligations and shared household responsibilities. The husband's choice affects her ability to function. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
