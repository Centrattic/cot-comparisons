He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband setting up his home office in their bedroom despite being offered the basement. The husband works mostly from conference calls, and the author feels restricted in her ability to use the top floor of the house when he's on calls. She's taking on most of the household chores and childcare, which is being impacted by his setup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for the office, possibly for a better view. However, the author's argument is that this setup is causing her significant inconvenience. She works from home too and has to manage the kids and housework. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her access to shared spaces, which affects her ability to work and take care of daily tasks. \n\nThe husband's perspective might be that he needs a quiet environment for work, which is important for his job. But he has the option of the basement, which is quieter and would presumably avoid these conflicts. The author suggested the basement, but he refused. That seems like a key point. If the basement is available and offers the silence he needs, then his choice to stay in the bedroom where there's more potential for disruption is problematic. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author is trying to balance her work, household responsibilities, and childcare. If moving the office to the basement would resolve the issue and he refuses, then the blame might lie more with the husband. The author is not the one causing the disruption; it's his decision to place the office in a high-traffic area. \n\nAlso, the fact that the husband is in a position where he can ask for silence but isn't willing to compromise by moving to a less disruptive area suggests he's the one not being considerate. The author is being realistic about the limitations of keeping the household quiet when kids are around. It's a shared space, so expecting complete silence isn't reasonable, especially if the alternative exists. \n\nTherefore, the husband's choice to prioritize his view over the shared living space is causing the conflict, making him the one at fault. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries and pointing out the impracticality of his setup.\n"
