He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home.\n\nFirst, let me read the situation again. The husband switched jobs and works from home a few days a week. He set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, which the wife suggested. The job is mostly conference calls, so the wife has to prevent the kids from disturbing him, which makes the entire top floor off-limits. She can't even take a shower or do chores during his calls. She works from home too and handles most of the chores and kids. She told him that if he's in the basement, she can guarantee no disturbances, but in the bedroom, she can't. The husband says she's the asshole for not being quiet, but she thinks he's the asshole for not choosing the basement.\n\nNow, I need to figure out who's at fault. The key points here are about shared space and mutual responsibilities. The husband chose the bedroom for his office despite the wife's suggestion. The bedroom is a shared space, especially since they have a baby and need to use the bathroom. By setting up in the bedroom, he's limiting the wife's use of the house during his work hours. The wife is working from home too and managing the household and kids. \n\nTypically, when someone works from home, they should set up a space that minimizes disruption to others. The basement is an option that would allow him to work without affecting the main living areas. Choosing the bedroom (a space needed by both for rest and hygiene) might be considered less considerate. The wife's frustration is about not being able to do basic things while he's on calls. \n\nThe husband's argument is that she should be quiet, but since the kids are part of the household and she's responsible for them, it's unrealistic to expect complete silence. The wife is trying to balance her work and family responsibilities, and his setup is making it harder for her. \n\nSo, the husband's choice to set up in the bedroom, a space that's essential for both of their needs, without considering the wife's responsibilities seems to be the root of the problem. The wife is not at fault for not being able to guarantee silence if he's in a shared space. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong for not using the available basement space that would prevent these issues. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
