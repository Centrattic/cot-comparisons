He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. They think the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nThe situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement. The wife suggests the basement because it's quieter, but he prefers the view. Now, when he's working from the bedroom, she can't do chores, shower, or even nap because she has to keep the kids quiet. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She tells him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, so he claims she's the asshole for not being quiet. She's arguing that he should have chosen the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for the view, but that decision affects the wife's ability to work and take care of the household. The wife is trying to balance work and family while he's in a position to have a quiet space. The basement is available and would solve the problem. The husband's preference for the view is causing disruption. The wife is making a reasonable request to set up in the basement where there's adequate space. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where she can't perform her duties. \n\nSo, the husband's choice is leading to the conflict. The wife is trying to manage the household and her own work while he's in a position to avoid the noise. The key point is that he didn't listen to her suggestion and insisted on the bedroom, which impacts her daily life. Therefore, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong because she's pointing out the consequences of his decision. The husband is the one who didn't consider the practical implications of his choice. \n\nThe answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. She's justified in her stance because the husband's choice is causing the problem, not her inability to keep the house quiet. He should have complied with the suggestion to use the basement where there's less disruption.\n"
