He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works and handles the kids and chores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. The basement is quieter and would minimize disturbances. The wife has to manage the kids and household tasks, and when the husband is in the bedroom, she can't use the top floor, including showering or doing chores. She's essentially giving up her space and time to accommodate his choice. \n\nThe husband's job is mostly on conference calls, so he needs silence. But by choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife can't have the same privacy or quiet. The wife's argument is that she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, so she's not at fault for not keeping the kids quiet. The husband thinks she should be quiet, but she's saying he should move to the basement where there's less chance of disturbance.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband made a choice that affects the household's daily life. The basement is available and would solve the problem. The wife is trying to balance her work and family responsibilities, and his choice is making that harder. It's about shared responsibility and considering each other's needs. The husband is in a position where he could easily move but refuses for a better view. That seems selfish. The wife isn't to blame for the disruptions caused by his decision. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
