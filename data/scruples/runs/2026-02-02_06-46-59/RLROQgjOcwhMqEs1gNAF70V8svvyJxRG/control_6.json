He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who has to manage the kids, chores, and her own work.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. The basement is quieter, so moving there would minimize disruptions. By staying in the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the top floor is off-limits during his calls. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is already a lot, and now she can't even take a shower or nap without worrying about disturbing him.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise. The husband's choice is affecting the wife's ability to function. The wife is honest about her limitations and tells him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is a reasonable stance. He's upset that she's not being quiet, but he's the one who chose the location that makes it impossible for her to be quiet because of the kids and chores. \n\nThe husband could have moved to the basement to avoid this conflict, but he didn't. The wife is trying to set boundaries, which is necessary for her own well-being. So, the husband's refusal to compromise might be the bigger issue here. The wife isn't at fault for not keeping him undisturbed if he's in a space that's inherently difficult to keep quiet. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
