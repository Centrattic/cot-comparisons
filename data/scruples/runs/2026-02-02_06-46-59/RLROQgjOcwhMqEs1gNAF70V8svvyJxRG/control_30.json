He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, which is causing the wife a lot of inconvenience. She suggested the basement, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, she's struggling with managing the kids, doing chores, and taking care of the baby while he's on calls in their bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband works from home part of the week and chose the bedroom as his workspace. The wife is handling most of the household duties and childcare, which is already a lot. By having the office in the bedroom, it's restricting her movement in the house, making it hard for her to do basic things like showering or taking a nap.\n\nThe key points here are about shared space and mutual respect. The husband's choice to use the bedroom for work affects the wife's ability to function. The wife is trying to balance work and home responsibilities, which can be overwhelming. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, which require silence, but the wife is also working and managing the home. The basement is a viable alternative that would minimize disruption for both.\n\nThe author (the wife) is arguing that she's not responsible for keeping him undisturbed when he's in their shared bedroom. She's not the one causing the disturbance; the presence of the kids and the need for her to manage them is. The husband's setup is making it so that she can't use her own space. On the other hand, the husband might feel that he's entitled to a quiet workspace, but he's choosing a location that's causing conflict.\n\nI think the main issue here is about space management and mutual consideration. The wife is trying to advocate for her own needs, especially since she's handling a lot. The husband's preference for the view in the bedroom is leading to a situation where the wife's basic needs aren't met. The fact that there's a basement available that could solve the problem makes the husband's choice seem less reasonable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for not being able to guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. The problem is the husband's choice of location. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The husband is the one making a choice that affects the wife's ability to function, and the wife is justified in pointing that out.\n"
